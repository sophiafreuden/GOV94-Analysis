"23 Mar, 2021","Killer talk: Democrats & liberal media whip up anti-Russia, anti- republicanparty hysteria to hide their misdeeds, but this ploy will fail","The Biden White House is quickly painting itself into a corner on the global and domestic fronts, labeling anyone outside of the Democratic franchise in the harshest terms. Is American hubris so bad it has forgotten diplomacy? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge In the paranoid mindset of the Biden administration, sequestered as it is behind a barbed-wire enclosure it erected following the “insurrection” of January 6, enemies are everywhere. From the purported white supremacists and ‘domestic terrorists’ that fill the rosters of the republicanparty , to the “killer” inside of the Kremlin who apparently has nothing better to do these days than meddle in US elections, the list is a long one. By way of example, consider a recent interview that ABC political commentator George Stephanopoulos conducted with US President Joe Biden, which touched upon an intelligence report that says Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian officials “PROBABLY directed Russia’s influence against the 2020 US Presidential election.” It is the same interview in which Putin is described as “a killer,” not initially by Biden, incidentally, but by his interlocutor. Stephanopoulos asks, apropos of nothing, “You think [Putin’s] a killer?” To which the US leader dutifully responds, “Uh-huh. I do.” When Stephanopoulos, in typically belligerent liberal fashion, pushes to know “what price he must pay,” the US president’s brain is out to lunch, as he begins to mutter a string of incoherencies and half sentences that have become the trademark of Biden speak. Clearly, the US mainstream media is back in its comfort zone, at liberty once again to write up its own foreign policy agenda – even during an interview with the president. In fact, it’s surprising that Biden was not taking dictation as Stephanopoulos ran his mouth. Although Donald Trump certainly had his defects, no reporter would have been able to run roughshod over him, making him agree to foolish remarks that could have tremendous repercussions on the world stage. The irony over the democraticparty ’s endless jabber about “Russian meddling in the US elections” is that the worst offender of that charge is none other than the Democrats themselves. Indeed, Nancy Pelosi’s euphemistically entitled “For the People Act,” should it be passed, would effectively institutionalize ballot fraud in all future elections, quickly turning the republicanparty into a dinosaur more worthy of a museum than any campaign trail. “The law would make permanent the Covid-19 emergency mail-in voting system, overriding whatever each state’s election law says,”explainedthe writer James Howard Kunstler, “plus permitting same-day motor-voter registration of any live body, citizen or not, plus removing all voter ID requirements, and much more to ensure the country is never again threatened by a fair election.” What better way for the Democrats to camouflage their deranged efforts to own the US election system than to scream “The Russians are coming!” at every opportunity?  And the Russian blame game certainly did not end there. Earlier this month, The New York Times ran yet another one of those classic “anonymous sources said”piecesthat is loaded to the rafters with potentially explosive consequences. Reporting on yet another unproven incident of “Russian meddling,” this time against US government agencies and corporations, the Times increased global warming dramatically with the following statement: “The first major move [against Russia] is expected over the next three weeks, officials said, with a series of clandestine actions across Russian networks that are intended to be evident to President Vladimir V. Putin and his intelligence services and military but not to the wider world” (Incidentally, this is not the first time that such threats have been made. In 2016, the US-based Atlantic Council,salivatingover the prospect of some hypothetical war with Russia, said cyber-offensive operations could include “the Moscow metro, the St. Petersburg power network, and Russian state-run media outlets such as RT.”) Keep in mind that the Times released this uncritical bit of bombast even though the identity of the purported perpetrators is not remotely clear. This demonstrates nicely how the left-wing media, which is nothing more or less than the official propaganda arm of the democraticparty , can forward any insane, unsubstantiated claim without needlessly concerning itself with the blowback – that ranges from defamation claims, to full-blown military escalation. The same rule applies to the domestic situation, where the Democrat-friendly media can vilify conservative voters, defaming them as ‘white supremacists,’ at the very same time that blacklivesmatter protesters are carrying out “mostly peaceful protests” that still managed to carry a billion-dollar price tag to rebuild destroyed neighborhoods across the country. Just imagine the result had they been ‘mostly violent protests’! When jaded Trump supporters, most armed with nothing deadlier than iPhones, stormed the Capitol building on January 6 to protest the results of the 2020 presidential election, they were compared to the same al-Qaeda terrorists who carried out the attacks against the United States on 9/11. Yet when blacklivesmatter and Antifa hurled Molotov cocktails and attacked police at the Portland federal courthouse, eventually seizing an entire urban block of Seattle in an effort to create a “police-free autonomous zone,” the media practically honored them as national heroes. With this sort of disproportional media support at its disposal, the democraticparty will continue to exist as a clear and present danger on the global and domestic stage. Thankfully, however, the problem is finally getting some due attention. Just last week, US Senior Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman, while penning his ruling in a libel case,took issuewith “ democraticparty ideological control” that is maintained through its massive media holdings. “Two of the three most influential papers (at least historically), The New York Times and The Washington Post, are virtually democraticparty broadsheets,” Silberman wrote. “And the news section of The Wall Street Journal leans in the same direction. The orientation of these three papers is followed by The Associated Press and most large papers across the country (such as the Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, and Boston Globe). “Nearly all television—network and cable—is a democraticparty trumpet.” While it’s certainly positive to see a growing awareness of the problem, it is another thing altogether to find a cure. After all, the owners of the various media, including social media, will not relinquish their awesome powers without a fight. Nor will the Democrats be anxious to lose the primary source of their strength. Yet it seems inevitable that unless a more balanced and impartial view of the political realities is fairly presented, both at home and abroad, the democraticparty will one day become its own worst enemy.

"23 Mar, 2021","Britain’s year of lockdowns has been marked by the elite’s incompetence, hypocrisy and utter disdain for the masses","The UK’s response to Covid has been marred by mistakes, but arguably a bigger frustration has been the elite’s blatant rule-breaking, with mistresses, eye tests and second homes all used as excuses to break lockdown. Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney It’s a year to the day that Prime Minister Boris Johnson instructed the world’s fifth-biggest economy to shut down. He told British citizens to stay at home, and closed the UK. In the blink of an eye, London, where I am based, went from a global metropolis to a ghost town. Streets were deserted, all future plans were scrapped and life ground to a halt. Johnsonannounced,“Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease.” That bookends seamlessly with his one-year anniversary announcement, nicknamed ‘The Stanley Johnson loophole’. It allows Britons to leave the country to tend to homes they own in foreign lands. The name apes Boris’s dadbreaching the rulesto fly to his Greek villa last July. Why is it seamless? Because it hammers home how inept the British government has been. There are serious expectations of a third wave of Covid-19 washing across the country, but it is inexplicably allowing people to travel, although only those wealthy enough to own multiple homes. If you try to without that caveat, you’re liable for a£5,000 fine. One rule for them and one rule for us; it’s been the story all along. One of the lockdown architects was government advisor Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling predicted that 250,000 could die without action. Only it turned out that the academic was flouting his own rules by having a relationship with a married woman, breaking social distancing guidelines. Heresigned in disgrace. That was bettered by BoJo’s right-hand man Dominic Cummings. He claimed during a live press conference that he drove 264 miles from London to Durham to stay with his parents, who would be looking after his kids. Cummings suspected he may have Covid-19, and wanted support. Before coming back to London, he drove 30 miles with his family to Barnard Castle to“test his eyesight”before driving back to London, against all the rules. This followed foolhardy Boris himself. He ignored warnings from health professionals toattendan England rugby match with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, in March – along with 81,520 others. The PM also slammed further advice on avoiding physical contact during public visits andboasted,“I am shaking hands.” Weeks later, he contracted Covid-19, was admitted to hospital, ended up in intensive care and almost died. Of course, he was afforded the best possible care and returned to full health. And what about Winston Churchill’s grandson Rupert Soames? He’s also the CEO of Serco, which has beeninvolvedin delivering the much-criticised £38 billion Test and Trace program. He explained alockdown-breaking tripon an overnight sleeper train from London to Inverness as a way to meet train staff, because his firm operates the line. But Soames was then spotted three hours away from Inverness on a boat in Loch Ness, close to where he owns a country estate. @piersmorganRupert Soames and his entourage off to his highland estate!! Lockdown just for locals then I presume!!pic.twitter.com/XD2Asia2c6 And the reason for his huge detour? He had toconduct interviewsas he was seeking to employ a new estate manager. It’s that stark. Four individuals from the elite who decided to ignore the rules because of influence, lust, power and wealth. That’s the tone which has permeated the whole Covid-19 experience in the UK. The poor, vulnerable and disenfranchised have suffered the most due to underlying health conditions, living in cramped conditions or unemployment. This has been compounded by the incompetence of Britain’s leaders. Along with Boris, the figureheads of the devolved nations Nicola Sturgeon (Scotland), Mark Drakeford (Wales) and Arlene Foster (Northern Ireland) also have to shoulder part of the blame. We have a combineddeath tollof 126,000. They all knew in 2016 that we weren’t prepared. A trial pandemic exercise was conducted and the response was so bad, the report stated“the UK’s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors”. Nothing was done. Then when it did come, our leaders brushed it off. Then it hit and they flouted the rules. The masses were left to flounder and die. There were numerous reports of alack of PPE, orders for equipment that wasunsatisfactoryand allegations of corruption in handing out public contracts related to Covid-19. The country was told it could enjoy Santa Claus and forget about the global pandemic. We could press pause, supposedly. But then Boris changed his mind and Christmas was cancelled. The population has lost faith in our leaders, which probably explains why there has been so much public disorder, with blacklivesmatter last summer and more recently at the Sarah Everard vigil and last weekendin Bristol. The combination of being locked down for a year and the utter disdain Boris and his cronies have shown for the unwashed masses is almost certainly contributing to these flashpoints. By and large the public has pulled together, with over one millionjoininga national volunteer programme to help others in need. Neighbours are doing tasks for those who are shielding and communities have rallied around. Towards the end of his infamous 2020 lockdown announcement, Boris said,“The people of this country will rise to that challenge.” It’s a tragedy that he and the rest of the elite haven’t. Britain has been betrayed. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"21 Mar, 2021",Intersectional imperialism: A wholesome menace,"The empire claps back. With Trump-style nationalism out the door, a new era of imperial ideology is upon us. ByAlex Rubinstein, an independent reporter on Substack. You can subscribe to get free articles from him delivered to your inboxhere, and if you want to support his journalism, which is never put behind a paywall, you can give a one-time donation to him through PayPalhereor sustain his reporting through Patreonhere. This mutation of the empire s dominant dogma is manifesting throughout global institutions of economic, political and social control and is materializing in a myriad of conflict theatres. In order to identify where woke imperialism exists, we have to define it first. So what is it? It’s certainly not the first iteration of hegemonic domination buttressed by moralism. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) was officialized by the United Nations in 2005, but its roots really trace back to the NATO bombing campaign of Yugoslavia. During the Obama years, the term“humanitarian intervention”caught on as the main moniker for such actions. Woke imperialism should be understood as a maturation of these concepts. As corporations have increasinglyembraced“rainbow capitalism”to keep up with the sensibilities of an increasingly liberal US public, so too have institutions of United States imperialism refined their pitches to reflect the increasing popularity of identity politics. This phenomenon has not gone unnoticed. As with everything on the internet, it has become the subject of memes, with an image of two US B-52 Stratofortress bombers having gone particularly viral. The image shows one B-52, labelled“Republicans,”dropping bombs. Another B-52, labelled“Democrats,”is also dropping bombs, but this time with a giant blacklivesmatter sticker and a rainbow flag emblazoned on its exterior. What both of the above memes can’t express, given their limited format, is the variety of methods of exerting imperial control, as it takes many forms beyond bombings. And not all of this can be chalked up to the presidential transition. We know that the State Department and three-letter agencies were hardly on-board with President Trump’s approach to foreign policy, nor his cultural proclivities. .@SecBlinken: When we design our foreign policy with the rights and needs of women and girls in mind, our policy is more effective, more humane, and more likely to make a lasting difference in people’s lives.pic.twitter.com/ssAyW9mNEq So while a lot of the trends identified in this article existed during the Trump administration, they are undeniably being ramped up by Biden’s. For example, in the first 10 days of this March, Women’s History Month, the State Department tweeted 26 times about“women,”compared to 10 times during the same period of the 2020. Earlier this month, NATO tweeted a flashy video claiming“diversity is our strength.” In light of NATO’s virtue signaling, it’s important to remember that many of the early leaders of NATO wereNaziswho dreamed of a Germany that was anything but diverse and inclusive. To this day, NATO has continued to support neo-Nazis in countries like Ukraine, while NATO states that hold permitted rallies honoring Nazi collaborators are only just nowcancellingthe marches because of the coronavirus, rather than stopping the glorification of Nazism. Diversity is our strength. Retweet to join us in celebrating the differences that make us stronger 💪#ZeroDiscriminationDaypic.twitter.com/As4phmspXR As Ireportedfollowing the launch of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, as he railed against neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bidenmetwith neo-Nazi leader Oleg Tyagnibok (anglicized Ukrainian spelling Oleh Tyahnybok). In terms of NATO’s championing of inclusion for people of color, its crowning achievement in this regard came following its bombing of Libya, which gave cover for jihadist militias to sodomize Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to death with a bayonet andpavedthe way for the reintroduction of slavery on the African continent. Outside of its halls of power in Brussels, this is what NATO-sponsored opportunity initiatives for people of color looks like. As the kids say,""big yikes."" The slogan used by NATO,“Diversity is our strength,”reproduces, verbatim, a majorcampaign themefrom Kamala Harris andJoe Bidenhimself. The talking point was alsousedlast year by the Central Intelligence Agency. Our diversity is our strength.pic.twitter.com/NVkzgIIJNS Perhaps the one to make the most use out of the theme is Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who has said the following: “Diversity and inclusion make us stronger, smarter, more creative, and more innovative. And our diversity gives us a significant competitive advantage on the world stage. Diversity makes any organization stronger – and for the State Department, it’s mission-critical. We’ve invested in diversity and inclusion to have a diplomatic workforce that reflects the diversity of our country.” Recently, the State DepartmentpromotedBlinken’s appearance on Hillary Clinton’s podcast, advertising that the two discussed “diversity and inclusion at the Department, American engagement, Russia, China and more.” The State Department, under Blinken, is so married to the concept that he created at the department a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer position which“will report directly to him,”State Department spokesman Ned Price said, adding, you guessed it,“Diversity and inclusion make us stronger, smarter, more creative, and more innovative.” .@StateDeptSpoxPrice: ""Today,@SecBlinkenannounced the creation of a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer position, which will report directly to him. Diversity and inclusion make us stronger, smarter, more creative, and more innovative."" For more:https://t.co/bXsvL7uMkp.pic.twitter.com/qN5A92TIx2 The Department of Defense is another leading institution in this trend. Last week, conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson attacked the Pentagon. It started with Joe Biden announcing that, under his and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s leadership, the military would be taking steps towards making itself more inclusive to women with policies including an overhaul of hair style restrictions and“maternity flight suits for women.” While pregnant women are generally banned from riding roller coasters, a policy of allowing them to fly fighter jets does not seem to me to have their best interests in mind, nor those of their children. Strength through diversity. These Marines broke barriers and exhibited courage on the battlefield.#KnowYourMil#BlackHistoryMonthpic.twitter.com/KTvuMkhoeT While Carlson blasted these policies, his criticism missed the crux of the issue as he argued that they made the US military weaker. The real goal of these policies, however, is to freshen the military’s face for a liberal citizenry. As the Airforceput itin January,“diversity”is a“force multiplier.” In response to the Fox segment, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby — formerly the spokesperson for the State Department under Obama — clapped back at Carlson in apress releaseentitled“Press SecretarySmitesFox Host That Dissed Diversity in U.S. Military.” “The United States military is the greatest the world has ever seen because of its diversity,”the press releasebegan. Kirby went on to note that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (a black man whom the mediacelebratedfor breaking a“brass ceiling,”) had said earlier in the week that the“lived experience”of a diverse fighting force factors“into our decision making.” I want every child to know that this is what vice presidents and generals in the United States Armed Forces look like.pic.twitter.com/y2OFL1z29r That same speech was featured on the Defense Department’s website under theheadline“Biden Showcases the Strength, Excellence of American Military Diversity.” In other news on Secretary Austin, according to another Pentagonpress release, he“welcomed the expanded role for NATO Mission Iraq”last month. That“expanded role”means beefing up the number of NATO troops occupying the country from 500 to“4,000 or 5,000,”accordingto Reuters. Not to be outdone by the State Department or Defense Department, following the inauguration of Joe Biden, the CIA has begun conducting a“digital facelift”to appeal to Generation Z in light of their politics leaning more towards radical liberalism than previous generations. “We had to go where the talent is,”Sheronda Dorsey, the CIA’s deputy associate director for talent,toldthe Wall Street Journal. She added that the CIA is looking to“increase racial, cultural, disability, sexual orientation and gender diversity so that its workforce is reflective of America. "" The Wall Street Journal goes on to write that“Today, the CIA’s digital face-lift coincides with a new presidential administration. [John] Brennan, whose directorship ended in 2017, says the Biden administration has sent out a ‘very strong signal on diversity’ with its intelligence appointees, including the first-ever female director of national intelligence, Avril Haines.” Former CIA Director John Brennan says that he is ""increasingly embarrassed to be a white male these days.""pic.twitter.com/vuVrO3uLu4 Brennan, who was CIA director under Obama, with Haines sitting under him at number two at the agency, has more recently told MSNBC that he is“increasingly embarrassed to be a white male these days, when I see what other white males are saying.” Brennan’s comments came in a discussion of congressional Republicans’ handling of the protests at the capitol in January.“They’ll continue to gaslight the country,”Brennan said. While heading up the agency, Brennan oversaw the CIA as it illegally spied on Congress through hacking as they were investigating torture by the agency — and lied about it. Now he’s complaining about""gaslighting""by Congress. The whole episode has been largely forgotten by the US public as media were“stanning”the agency throughout the Trump era. Trump enemy number one, Nancy Pelosi, recentlyestablisheda“diversity office”in the House of Representatives. Years ago, she helped the CIA coverup torture in addition to heavily backing the war in Iraq. While technically“independent,”globally muscular financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are functionally a part of the US government, and like other institutions referenced in this article, are adopting identity politics as a means of whitewashing their anti-human agenda. We are pleased to announce the appointment of Stephanie von Friedeburg as@IFC_orgSenior VP of Operations.@SvonFriedeburgis an advocate for the advancement of women and a champion of diversity and inclusion. Her career spans almost three decades in the@WorldBankGroup.pic.twitter.com/zCjYvhJdju The DC-based World Bank’s president is chosen by the President of the US, with even their own websiteadmitting“Traditionally, the World Bank President has always been been [sic] a U.S. citizen nominated by the United States.” The U.S. is also the largest shareholder at both the World Bank and IMF, which is also based in DC. One leaked manual published by Wikileaks entitled“Army Special Operations Forces Unconventional Warfare”cites the World Bank and IMF as US“weapons in times of conflict up to and including large-scale general war.” “Army Special Operation Forces understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of unconventional warfare,”the document continues. “As major decisions require an 85 percent super majority, the United States can block any major changes”at the World Bank, according to the Army document. For International Women’s Day, the IMF hosted adiscussionwith Biden’s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen entitled“The Age of Womenomics.” “We have chosen this theme ‘the age of womenomics’ consciously,”Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director, said. “Never in my life I have seen so many women in key positions where core economics and finance matter: you, as the minister of finance of the United States; Chrystia Freeland in Canada; Christine Lagarde my predecessor at the [European Central Bank]; Ngozi [Okonjo-Iweala] at the World Trade Organization; the very first woman president of a multilateral development bank, Odile [Renaud-Basso] at the [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]...” Beyond promoting themselves as bastions of tolerance, imperialist institutions are also using wokeness to justify foreign resource extraction, violations of sovereignty and international law, military occupation and even coup d’etats. In Syria, where the United States, European governments, Gulf state patriarchal petromonarchies and NATO ally Turkey have waged 10 years of proxy warfare via al-Qaeda-type sectarian insurgents, a champion of distinctly American identity politics has arisen: the YPG. For years, you’d have been hard pressed to find a leftist in the United States that did not give unquestioning support for the“Rojava women’s revolution.”The ostensible political project of Kurdish fighters in Northeastern Syria was evendubbedby Vice News the“Most Feminist Revolution the World Has Ever Witnessed.” American anarchists, propagandized with pro-YPGliteratureand the ideology of“democratic confederalism”popularized by the lateZionistacademic Murray Bookchin, and promoted by his daughter,Debbie Bookchinof the New York City-based“Emergency Committee For Rojava,”made names for themselves in leftist circles and on Twitter by joining up with the Kurdish fighting force called the People s Protection Units (YPG). While the Kurdish fighters in Syria were first backed by Obama, Trump continued to support them to“protect the oil.”In other words, so that the United States could profit from the extraction of assets rightfully belonging to the sovereign government of Syria. Now that Biden is in office, Kurdish fighters are once again becoming the subject of renewed media attention and adoration by the Western left. Glorification of the conquests by Kurdish forces in Syria reached a fever pitch during the Raqqa campaign. One group was established, which now has its ownWikipedia pagedespite it’s actual existence being dubious, by foreign queer anarchists called the“The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army.”While the historic city of Raqqa was being destroyed to the tune of70 percent, these feel-good headlines about a supposedly revolutionary and inclusive alternative to statism that the Kurdish fighters and their allies represented dominated the narrative on the left. Before we move away from Syria, it would be irresponsible not to mention the story of Amina Abdallah Araf al Omari, the“Gay Girl in Damascus.”The fake persona was created in order to stir up anti-Assad sentiment from Western LGBTQ communities, but it wasexposedas the charade of a white American man named Tom MacMaster by Palestinian journalist Ali Abunimah after the“gay girl”was“kidnapped.” Now that Biden is in office, these kinds of dirty tricks to promote the dirty war on Syria are making a comeback. Based on an article in Jacobin, a new movie is in the works entitled“Stefan Vs. ISIS.”It isbilledas a“Story Of Non-Binary Millennial Who Joined The Kurdish Freedom Fighters”by Deadline in a March 5 article. While the Jacobin writer of the original story, Connor Kilpatrick, has co-writing credits, Jacobin editor Bhaskar Sunkara is set to co-executive produce the film. One Middle East-based reporter complained to me that these journalists are now poised to profit from a war they helped sell in the first place, and are placing the identity issues of a Westerner at the center of the conversation around the battle against ISIS rather than the scores of Syrians and Iraqis who lost their lives fighting them.“The Syrian war,”they said, isn’t for a bunch of foreign leftists“to turn into a romantic ballad to identity issues. Kurds are super traditional, no way is even the YPG into this gender fluidity stuff.” In a similar vein, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s production company was reported in late January to be working on a TV series adapting the book“The Daughters of Kobani: A Story of Rebellion, Courage, and Justice”by Gayle Lemmon for the screen. Following an intense bidding war over the rights to adapt the book, Deadlinereportedthat“For the Clintons, the property feels like the perfect IP to help launch their banner given the subject matter and strong women that helped Lemmon write it.” Last week, LemmonjoinedMeghan McCain on The View to talk about her book. McCain’s father, the late John McCain, was the most militaristicsenatorin modern US history and a major promoter of the proxy war in Syria, the Senator even meeting with so-called“moderate rebels”with the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army who turned out to be responsible for the kidnapping of 11 Shia Muslims. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, where the United States maintains its longest-running regime change fail, or“L,”I recentlynotedhow Biden plans to keep“residual forces”there to continue occupying the country despite the agreement reached between the Taliban and the Trump administration to have a full withdrawal. German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle iswarningthat“Afghan women risk losing their rights in a new political setup.”Now, the Biden administration is looking to negotiate the dealwherein“all options remain on the table.” Earlier this month, Vox Newsreportedon“internal debates”within the White House over a withdrawal from Afghanistan. Reportedly, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley made the“impassioned — and at times ‘emotional’”argument that should US forces withdraw,  women’s rights in the country“will go back to the Stone Age.” Yet while there is no doubt that the Taliban has little respect for the rights of women, that was hardly a concern of Joe Biden when hepromisedin October 2012 that“We are leaving in 2014. Period.” But speaking of the Stone Age; the US has dropped around 25,500 bombs on Afghanistan since Biden’s promise if you add up themonthly figurespublished by the US Airforce. And those bombs don’t come cheap, so it should come as no surprise that Milley went on to argue that since the US has spent so much“blood and treasure”in the country in the past decades, it is not worth it to leave. To put it in the parlance of Zoomers, General Milley wants America to""secure that bag."" Somebody should tell the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman that“this ain t it, chief.” Wokeism isn’t just a useful tool of empire in the ostensible fight against terrorism, but also in the fight against socialism. In Ecuador, where the US is backing a faux left candidate as an alternative to the socialist frontrunner in the country’s presidential elections, identity politics have been deployed to drum up support for a neo-liberal. Journalist Ben NortonexposedYaku Pérez, billed as an indigenous eco-socialist, for his ties to the US government. After Pérez came in third place in the first round of Ecuador’s presidential election, disqualifying him from the runoff, the US embassycalled himto reassure that he would be a part of it. Since then, Pérez hascalledfor a military coup and for his socialist opponent, Andrés Arauz, to be criminally prosecuted. Norton also points out that Pérez’s wife Manuela Picq, is an adviser to him and is helping to manage his campaign. Picq’s background is as an academic focused on sexuality and gender studies. As we proceed into the Biden years, identity politics, intersectionality — in a word, wokeness — will be increasingly used to justify the exploits of a racist empire. That is, unless the left is able to adopt a doctrine to counter the empire’s dogma instead of continuing to play into its hands. The Roman historian Tacitus said“Great empires are not maintained by timidity.”This may be true, but today, the maintenance of empire is justified by its inclusivity. The ability of the US to""flex""on the world stage is contingent on its ability to reference the diversity of it s ruling class. There’s the tea. Think your friends would be interested?

"13 Mar, 2021","White people may not like it, but here’s why it’s time for black descendents of slaves to be paid billions in reparations","I’ve got ancestors who toiled on the plantations of the Caribbean and America, and others who were exploited under colonial rule. They deserve justice and we – just like the relatives of Holocaust victims – deserve compensation. David Matthewsis a writer whose work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday and the Observer, and on the BBC and Channel 4. He is the author of several books, including Voices of the Windrush Generation. Follow him on Twitter@mrdavematthews. With the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, set to become thefirst city in Americato pay black residents reparations, millions of clenched fists will be punching the air throughout the African diaspora. I for one will be raising a glass to the city’s good burghers who’ve come up with the novel idea of using a three percent tax levy on recreational cannabis sales, among other things, to finance a fund aimed at distributing $10 million over 10 years. It’s just one decisive step in a burgeoning issue: right across America, hundreds of communities and organisations are examining the reparations issue like never before. From California’s state legislature to small cities like Evanston, to religious denominations such as the Episcopal Church and leading colleges like Georgetown University in Washington, hundreds of entities aren’t just idly mulling over or waffling about such payments – they’re looking at how to put them into practice. This comes after the US congress heard testimony on ‘H.R. 40’ – a bill aimed at establishing a commission on the legacy of slavery to examine potential payments for the descendants of enslaved Africans. I’m all for reparations – and not just because I’ve had my eye on a Porsche 911 for ages. Over the years, I’ve heard much bellyaching from vested-interest whites and Stockholm-syndromed blacks who can’t spell ‘reparations’ let alone figure out innovative and realistic mechanisms for paying this highly contested, but arguably just, form of restitution. Detractors moan that it ‘can’t be done’ or ‘it’ll never work’ or ‘who deserves it?’ or ‘where will it all end?’ – as if they actually give a fig about the ethics, morality or practicalities of reparations. Enough, already. We all know what your problem is: you just don’t want black people to ‘get even’. But eons of old-boy networks, patronage, nepotism, bungs, backhanders, bigotry and BS about the scourge of positive discrimination (aka ‘a break’) aside, if we can land a multibillion-dollar one-ton Tonka toy on Mars while simultaneously paying millions of people hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, pounds and euros to get drunk and sit around at home watching daytime television, then we can figure out how to literally settle this blacks v. whites beef once and for all. I’ll happily STFU about racism forever if you just show me the dough and point me to the dotted line I need to sign. Hell, throw in a generous repatriation bonus and I’ll willingly ‘go back to where I came from’. Just name your price. Whether it’s governments, corporations, banks, the landed gentry… I really don’t care who’s paying. I want to be your friend as much as you want to be mine. So, let’s just cut the pretence about ‘healing’ or ‘coming together’ or creating a ‘post-racial’ world. Just pay up and let’s all go about our business. Because if the West doesn’t start coughing up, things are gonna start blowing up. Real soon. The killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the subsequent rise of blacklivesmatter may well have been a game changer. Certainly, the movement has catalysed current thinking in ways previously unimaginable, particularly among white people (did I really see the footballer John Terry sporting a blacklivesmatter T-shirt last year?). But blacklivesmatter , the Black Panthers, MLK, Malcolm X, the Maroons, Queen Nanny, Harriet Tubman, Toussaint Louverture and millions of ordinary black people within the diaspora have been arguing against slavery and thus for reparations for centuries. According to University College London’s (UCL) Legacies of British Slave-ownershipresearch, 10% of wealthy 19th-century Britons were directly connected to the slave trade. Proceeds from this ‘human cargo’ helped build railways, businesses, buildings and art collections that exist today. Perversely, when the British introduced their 30-year trickle-down abolition programme in the early 1800s, they paid some £20 million in reparations, not to newly emancipated slaves, but to the slave owners for their loss of “property”. In today’s money, this compensation would be worth around £2.4 billion. Needless to say, punching a 19th-century sum into an online inflation calculator does neither the economics of slavery nor its far-reaching legacy any justice. For one, a couple of billion pounds is chicken feed. It seems incalculable assessing the cost to those African states and a diaspora that has borne the brunt of 300 years of transatlantic slavery, in which upwards of 12 million kidnapped bodies were shipped off to, shunted between, and sacrificed at the altar of Western decadence. Former special advisor to Barack Obama Stuart E. Eizenstat hasargued, like many others opposed to reparations, that cash payments are not the way forward. This comes from someone who “spent decades of my life negotiating more than $17 billion in reparations for Holocaust survivors” from German governments. But every day, on the courthouse steps of Britain, America and other former slave-running Western powers, in cases from sex discrimination to libel to copyright infringement to breaches of contract, billions of dollars in claims are settled before litigation begins. Why? Because it’s more cost-effective to settle up and “make the problem go away”. If you don’t believe it works, just ask Donald Trump, or Bill Clinton… Doing the right thing avoids future embarrassment and, whether by default or by design, in giving the ‘plaintiffs’ within the diaspora financial restitution it helps to silence at least some of the animus between black people and elites. I stress the latter because another false narrative put about by the anti-reparations dog whistlers is that the overwhelming majority of ordinary white people – unconnected as they are historically or as beneficiaries to slavery – should be made to feel responsible and pay compensation through personal taxation. This is nonsense. Reparations could easily be paid via those legions of tax-dodging, money laundering and racketeering entities that have gotten away with it for too long. That’s not to say that there aren’t legitimate arguments against reparations. For instance, take everyone’s favourite African-American conservative – 90-year-old economist, social theorist, and Stanford University senior fellow Thomas Sowell. Responding to the writer Ta Nehisi Coates’ impassioned essay, The Case for Reparations, and referencing his time living through America’s Jim Crow segregation, Sowell has said: “It was a rotten system, but I don’t know how we get from that to reparations. What we see in the United States in terms of the bad things we see all around the world. If you were to give reparations to everyone whose ancestors had been slaves, I suspect that you’d have to give reparations to more than half the entire globe. Slavery was not confined to one set of races. I suspect that most of the people [who were] either slaves or slave owners around the world were neither white nor black. I mean, this was a universal curse of the human species.” There is, however, no statute of limitation in law, nor a moral or ethical concept, governing restitution for slavery. So what if the Romans enslaved ‘X’ or the Egyptians enslaved ‘Y’. It’s not just a false comparison to liken the slavery of antiquity or that imposed on the Irish or Scottish or whoever with transatlantic human trafficking; in the British context, at least, it makes a mockery of the link between pre- and industrial revolution slavery, colonialism, post-colonialism, and the economic mess many within the diaspora are in today. Reparations need to be paid because the transatlantic slave trade, put simply, is but one chapter in a centuries-old system of exploitation that got me and millions of others to where we are today. Other ethnic groups can argue the toss as to whether they’re owed or ‘deserve’ reparations. Good luck to them. But I take a pragmatic view of the issue: post-slavery, my parents and grandparents lived under British colonial rule, i.e., they existed not in a democracy, but in a de facto fascist state. They were socially engineered as a result of the slave trade and then forced to toil under a colonial-fascist regime before a scorched-earth imperialist policy coerced them to Britain to work as cheap immigrant labour. Talk about a win-win-win for the (white) man. I’m neither a religious man, nor an establishment toady. Likewise, I’d never deign to call myself a ‘man of the people’. But I do appreciate how scripture, elitist rhetoric and straight-talking vox populi helps to expose the rank hypocrisy surrounding our ever-present discourse on race and, increasingly, slave-trade reparations. While 63 per cent of Americansbelieve in Godwith “absolute certainty”, only one in five thinks that the US government should use “taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.” This figure plummets to just 10% when the same question is put towhite Americans only. Patently, Americans have a problem with numbers. Literally. As the Good Book says, Numbers 14:18: “The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.” I know many people who can go back three or four generations and find relatives who were under the cosh or the lash picking cotton or cane in the Carolinas or West Indies back in the day. In fact, I’ve located a few not-so-distant relatives of mine connected to the plantations of the Caribbean and the Americas. Thanks to online genealogy sites, DNA databases and access to government and academic records, millions like me can draw direct lines back to thousands of slave owners, colonialists and their modern-day profiteers. Q.E.D. As Lord Hewart, the early-20th-century Lord Chief Justice of England, once said: “It is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.” When it comes to delivering ‘justice’ for the slave trade, and placating a reparations lobby that’s growing in strength, depth and influence, it’s time for those holding the purse strings to put up if they want those of us who support the movement to shut up.

"13 Mar, 2021","Scammer charged with money laundering & wire fraud after bilking $450k from donors for fake blacklivesmatter charity, DOJ says","A fraudster has been indicted on federal charges for his alleged role in swindling hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors who thought they were giving to a blacklivesmatter group, instead pocketing the funds for himself. Ohio man Sir Maejor Page, 32, was slapped with four federal counts this week, the DOJ announced in astatementon Friday, accusing him of making“fraudulent misrepresentations”to contributors to the phony blacklivesmatter group, which was portrayed as a tax-exempt charity based in Atlanta, Georgia. Officials claim he ultimately took in more than $450,000. “Page is accused of using unprecedented tensions and uncertainty due to widespread civil unrest and a global pandemic to fill his own bank account,”said FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric B. Smith. Page allegedly purchased homes, traveled, and spent other people s money to buy luxury items for himself, all on the backs of hardworking people believing they were donating to a worthy cause. Initially arrested by the FBI last September, Page is said to have established the blacklivesmatter of Greater Atlanta ( blacklivesmatter GA) group in early 2016, at which point it was formally registered as a non-profit organization. However, while the group’s tax-exempt charity status was revoked by Georgia authorities in 2019 after Page failed to submit the proper forms for three consecutive years, he continued to rake in money, telling donors in private chats that their funds would be“used to combat racial and social injustices,”according to the DOJ. Much of that fundraising was done through Facebook, which was unaware the group’s non-profit corporation had been dissolved. “As a result, BMLGA’s Facebook page continued to be displayed as a non-profit organization with a donation button through the end of September 2020, and Facebook continued to collect and disperse the purported charity donations on a bi-monthly basis,”the department continued. Page then allegedly took those funds and blew“a substantial portion”on personal expenses, including clothes, entertainment, hotel rooms and – in the largest sum – property he intended to make his personal residence. He is said to have concealed the latter purchase by putting its title under the name“Hi Frequency Ohio,”while also entering into a nondisclosure agreement with the seller so as to keep his involvement and use of donor money under wraps. Acriminal complaintfiled against Page earlier this week shows the government seized more than $250,000 in forfeitures from a Bank of America count under the blacklivesmatter GA name, as well as the property bought with the proceeds. While he has since been released from custody on a $10,000 bond,accordingto an Ohio ABC affiliate, he faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the four counts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. His next court hearing is set for March 17. Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"12 Mar, 2021",Minneapolis settles lawsuit from George Floyd estate for $27mn ahead of Derek Chauvin trial,"The Minneapolis City Council has unanimously approved a civil lawsuit settlement worth $27 million with the estate of George Floyd, over his death while being detained by police last year. The settlement includes $500,000 to be sent to the neighborhood where Floyd died during his arrest in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. The $27 million payment marks the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history. “That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a Black man sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end,”Ben Crump, the attorney representing the Floyd family, said in a statement. The city council’s decision comes ahead of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former officer accused of being responsible for Floyd’s death. Currently in custody, Chauvin is facing second-degree and third-degree murder charges, as well as one of manslaughter. The third-degree charge was added this week at the request of prosecutors. Floyd’s last moments and death went viral last year after a video showed Chauvin holding his knee against Floyd’s neck for approximately nine minutes after he was handcuffed and brought to the ground. Floyd became unresponsive and died. His death sparked massive blacklivesmatter protests in major cities across the country – some of which turned violent – as well as overseas. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is set to begin on March 29. Jury selection is currently underway. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"11 Mar, 2021","LA police was unprepared for George Floyd protest violence ‘not seen in years,’ believed it would be ‘peaceful’, report says","LAPD was poorly trained, demoralized and disorganized during the May-June 2020 riots, and mistakenly believed they would be peaceful instead of featuring violent and organized “disrupters,” according to a new report. Areportcommissioned by the Los Angeles, California city council faults the police for arresting too many people, and not enough violent rioters; using too much nonlethal ammunition, but not stopping the riots fast enough; jailing too many protesters, but not setting up field jails; and assuming“racial justice”protests would be peaceful based on prior experience, and therefore not being “proactive” about the unprecedented and unexpected violence that followed the death of George Floyd. Those are just some of the things that leap out of the report authored by a panel of former police commanders led by attorney Gerald Chaleff, and published Thursday. BREAKING: First after-action report on LAPD s handling of the summer protests and unrest finds poor planning, inadequate training, disregard for rules on mass arrests and crowd control established after past failures to manage protests (w/@AlpertReyes):https://t.co/KLVcCClJwq Floyd died in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 25, 2020. Riots broke out in the Twin Cities the very next day. Protests in downtown Los Angeles on May 27-28 were“marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality,”the report says, but LAPD treated them as isolated incidents rather than“as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across”the US. The violence caught the LAPD off guard, as they“had believed that the good relationships which had been developed with various communities would cause any protests to be peaceful, as they had been in the past.” Hiding among the protesters were“disrupters”who threw dangerous objects at police and targeted them with lasers, the report noted, in a level of violence that“had not been seen at demonstrations in years.”Yet it faults the LAPD leadership for not being“proactive”about containing the groups whose objective was to“create chaos and confrontation with the police,”among other things. The Chaleff report reveals that some groups of looters“appeared to be well coordinated,”using scouts and“convoys of up to ten cars”to target a location, only to move elsewhere when police responded. Other groups that directly targeted police for violence were“dramatically”different from such rioters in the past, more violent and better organized. They threw“bricks and concrete blocks, using firecrackers or explosive devices, and pointing lasers at officers’ eyes.” Another part of the report talks about the“unrelenting”use of lasers in both LA and places“such asPortland,”as well as“containers filled with urine, frozen water bottles, and caustic chemicals such as bleach.”LAPD reported that 106 officers were injured during the riots. “The Department must do everything it can to provide for officer safety and at the same time protect the safety of those who are peacefully protesting,”the report said, without specifying as to how. LAPD did not establish a command post until May 30 and the first field jail until June 2. More than 4,000 people were arrested between May 29 and June 2 – many of whom have sued the city claiming that under municipal code, they should have only been issued a citation and released. There was also“chaos of command”as officers often received conflicting orders from their superiors. Chaleff and his team found that LAPD had lost nearly half of its senior command staff between 2018 and 2020, leaving it without leadership skilled in“public order policing,”as riot control is now called. The rank and file were also not properly trained in riot control techniques, including the“problematic”deployment of 40mm riot guns, as the dynamics of their use“dramatically change in a crowd control situation when the person engaging in the criminal behavior is not standing still.” The report cited a survey by the Los Angeles Police Protective League showing the department’s morale is close to rock bottom. More than 99 percent of officers do not feel supported by the mayor or the city council, while 86.33 percent do not feel supported by the LAPD leadership. The report made 67 recommendations to the city council,  but the chief among them was to create a high-level position of a“Strategic Emergency Manager”within the LAPD. This displeased blacklivesmatter activists, however, who called it undue criminalization of peaceful protests. What the report“doesn’t do is really critique the notion that LAPD should be putting down righteous protests in the first place,”Melina Abdullah, co-founder of blacklivesmatter -LA, told the Los Angeles Times.

"11 Mar, 2021",UK police urged to ‘think very carefully’ before participating in blacklivesmatter protests – report,"A report by the UK’s independent police watchdog has warned the nation’s police to consider their actions before engaging with protestors during demonstrations by taking a knee, skateboarding or dancing with activists. The warning from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) came in a report commissioned by the Home Secretary after 2020 saw protests from a number of groups on the streets of the UK. Thereportexamined how police handled the protests – including how they engaged with activists on the ground.“We inspected 10 police forces with recent experience of policing protests and consulted a wide range of other bodies, including protest groups and – through a survey of over 2000 people – the general public,”HMIC said of its research. The watchdog recommended that officers“think very carefully before they take any actions which may be interpreted as showing support for, or aversion towards, any protest”, stating that it would“rarely be appropriate”for them to do so while at work. The report highlighted one example where a police officer took the knee at a blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protest, resulting in their colleagues facing abuse from activists around them until they were pressured into following suit. HMIC did outline how there could be some instances where it would be understandable for officers to engage with protestors in the“spur of the moment”if it helps with“diffusing tension at a protest”, but in general said officers should not make it a habit of it so as to avoid appearing to show support or opposition for any cause. In June 2020, footage shared on social media showed British police officers outside Downing Street joining protesters in taking a knee, a symbol of the blacklivesmatter protest movement after it was done by American football player Colin Kaepernick. Similar videos of officers engaging with activists occurred in 2019 during Extinction Rebellion protests, with videos showing British cops dancing with demonstrators and even skateboarding with Think your friends would be interested?

"9 Mar, 2021",Piers Morgan s skeptical response to Megan Markle suicidal claims investigated by Ofcom after getting 41k complaints,"The UK media watchdog Ofcom has launched an inquiry into an episode of a morning news show in which anchor Piers Morgan said he doubted explosive claims made in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle s recent interview with Oprah Winfrey. Ofcom said by 2pm GMT on Tuesday it had received 41,015 complaints about an episode of ITV s Good Morning Britain (GMB) just a day earlier, in which Morgan said he didn t""believe a word""the Duchess of Sussex said during the tell-all interview. ""We have launched an investigation into Monday s episode of Good Morning Britain under our harm and offence rules,""the watchdog said in a statement. ITV announced on Tuesday afternoon that Morgan had chosen to leave GMB after presenting the show for five years. “Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain,”the broadcaster said, adding that it had accepted his decision. Morgan, a TV personality and former journalist, sparked an immense backlash on social media by saying he doubted the claims Markle made in her bombshell interview, broadcast on CBS in the US on Sunday night and on the UK s ITV on Monday. In the Oprah interview, Markle and her husband Harry claimed that the British royal family s treatment of her made her feel suicidal and that a senior royal had asked how dark her then-unborn baby son s skin might be. GMB co-presenter Morgan aired his views about the interview again on the programme on Tuesday as he sought to clarify his comments regarding the suicide claims made by Markle. He said his stated disbelief of her comments was""all-encompassing""and that any claims of mental illness and suicide are""extremely serious things""and should be treated as such, adding that people should have access to help if they need it. Buckingham Palace, which does not usually comment on Royal scandals, on Tuesday issued a short statement responding to claims made during the Oprah interview, saying that the royal family is""saddened""by the allegations. It said the""concerning""claims about race should be taken""seriously""and added:""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members."" The 41,000 complaints directed at Morgan s comments on GMB are far more than the 31,000 Ofcom received about reality show Britain s Got Talent in 2020. The show was the UK s most complained-about programme last year after it came under fire for a segment showing support for the blacklivesmatter movement. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"8 Mar, 2021",WATCH: Minneapolis battens down the hatches with extreme security ahead of trial of George Floyd’s alleged killer,"Authorities in Minneapolis have erected steel fencing, barbed wire and concrete barricades outside the city’s courthouse and local police stations ahead of the Derek Chauvin trial, set to begin Monday. The former police officer will stand trial for the May 25 killing of George Floyd in an incident which rocked the US to its core and triggered months of unrest and billions of dollar’s worth of damage. An estimated 15 million to 26 million people participated in blacklivesmatter protests in the US in the aftermath of Floyd s death. Armored personnel carriers have been deployed and local Minneapolis police stations have all been fortified in anticipation of further protests as Chauvin s trial is set to commence with jury selection. The proceedings are expected to last two months, and preparations for the trial have been ongoing for the past seven months. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and local government officials have developed a plan, dubbed“Operation Safety Net,”designed to avoid a return to the violence which swept the country in summer 2020 and saw buildings burned, widespread vandalism, looting and numerous deaths. The stated aims of the operation are the prevention of crime and damage to property and the protection of the First Amendment right to protest and peaceful assembly. Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Binder claimed that“law enforcement escalated”the violence last summer and“created the conditions for folks to come from outside our community to cause more harm.” “I don t think that we can police ourselves out of police violence,”she added. Ben Crump, an attorney who represents the Floyd family, cited onereportby the US Crisis Project, which found that 95 percent of the roughly 10,600 blacklivesmatter protests between Floyd s death in late May and August 22 were peaceful. “This will be a referendum on whether police are held accountable for killing black people in America in 2021,”Crump said, adding that the Floyd family expects Chauvin to be convicted of“torturing George Floyd to death.” However, according to a report by the City Assessor’s Office, the estimated damage caused by the unrest in Minneapolis alone is between $250 million and $350 million. Meanwhile, areportby Verisk Property Claims Service issued in November estimated the total cost of the national unrest in the wake of George Floyd s death as surpassing $2 billion, the most since such records began. For context, the PCS estimates the insured losses caused by the Rodney King riots in 1992 at $775 million. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"7 Mar, 2021",New York Times mocked for attempting to downplay 2020 blacklivesmatter protest violence as ‘misinformation’,"The New York Times has been lambasted online for bizarrely claiming that violence surrounding blacklivesmatter protests in 2020 was merely “misinformation” and likening it to Deep State conspiracy theories. The Gray Lady’s Jennifer Medina sought to unravel the mystery behind Latinos in the US voting Republican, in a Fridayarticletitled:“A Vexing Question for Democrats: What Drives Latino Men to Republicans?” Medina teased out the motivations of Latino Republicans through a series of interviews, before attempting to conflate the notion that the “deep state” had taken over the government during the Trump administration or that“ blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence,”dismissing both ideas as “misinformation” within the same breath. “Some of the frustrations voiced by Hispanic Republican men are stoked by misinformation, including conspiracy theories claiming that the deep state took over during the Trump administration and a belief that blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence.” Needless to say, the ever-watchful eye of Twitter did not let this claim about widespread violence slide. One Twitter user was blunt in his analysis:“The New York Times is lying.” The New York Times is lying.pic.twitter.com/3w1AP02B1Q Others criticized the ‘paper of record’ for using weasel words to detract from the gravity and scale of the violence witnessed throughout the blacklivesmatter protests across the US in 2020. Has anybody noticed that the lying media slips in the weasel word “widespread” whenever it wants to hand you a bunch of bullshit? Widespread can mean anything, so no matter how much looting and rioting were done by blacklivesmatter , the NYTs will say it wasn’t enough to be “widespread.” According toForbes, between George Floyd’s death at the hands of the Minneapolis police department on May 25 and June 8, 2020, at least 19 people died during the protests. There were many injuries and hospitalizations on both sides of the security barricades throughout the protests and riots which took place across the US in 2020. Six officers werereportedlybadly injured in just one 24-hour period of the Seattle riots in 2020.

"5 Mar, 2021","If you’ll miss lockdown when it’s over, you need to get out more. It’s going to be a wake-up call for the whole world","A new poll has found that most people in the UK will miss some aspects of lockdown. Are they serious? After more than a year cooped up, we should embrace freedom – especially as it will present unique opportunities for change. ByCharlie Stone,author and journalist who has worked for the BBC, several national newspapers in the UK and international media. I don’t mean to be rude, but if lockdown really is your idea of ‘fun’, maybe, just maybe, when it’s finally all over, you need to get a life? Some people like to be indoors. Some people are at their absolute happiest alone on their own sofa with the TV remote control in one hand and a fat slice of microwave pizza in the other. How else can we explain the YouGovsurveythat found 55 percent of Brits aregoing to misssome elements of lockdown? Over half of Britons (55%) say they will miss aspects of lockdown when it is overhttps://t.co/bRZRzvANHfpic.twitter.com/cD1xP39MQs But what happens when you’ve seen everything Netflix and HBO and Disney+ have to offer? You might have to turn to the BBC or ITV or, God forbid, sit through the often unhinged hysteria on CNN (man, oh man, they’re STILL obsessing over Donald Trump). But that won’t last long, either. There’s never anything on. I’ve had a flick through myself already. Many times. This has been going on, pretty much, for a year now after all. I get it, at least a little bit. Sometimes the virus and the lockdown can be the perfect excuse to get out of something that you simply didn’t want to do. Maybe you don’t much like the weekly visit to Auntie Dot in the care home, on account of her flatulence and extreme right-wing views. Okay. Work, too. Not having to go to the office and actually physically engage with some of those people that really stress you out. Especially the bosses, although those guys did give you the best lockdown dreams you’ve ever had – the ones where you’re Vlad the Impaler and you get to see them slowly sink to the bottom of a tall spike to join their own entrails. Or is that just me? Not seeing folk that you truly dislike – even hate – can be truly liberating. At some point, though, my ever-fattening friends, you have to emerge blinking and staggering out into the light. The human species wasn’t built to stay forever in a cave, and even bats don’t live there on their own; they gather by the tens of thousands. So, it’s not that safe in there, particularly when you think about all that chat about bats being where this new coronavirus came from in the first place… Just like bats, even when humans actually did live in caves, we didn’t live alone. The human species is tribal; cities are merely an extension of what we already were anyway. We just added glass and concrete and electricity cables and WiFi and flushing toilets to something for which we already felt the need. Maybe the lockdown, for many people, has been a wake-up call. So, if you really are going to miss it, if you genuinely do want to spend your entire life alone on that sofa… well, maybe you need to do a little bit of a reassessment. When all this is over, we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build something new. Go and join a club. Play poker. Play golf. Bowls. Tennis. Whatever, it doesn’t actually matter what you choose… you just need other members of the human tribe to do it alongside you. Why not try yoga? I’ve been able to do it during lockdown, and I’m utterly crap. But it’s fun and it’s approximately four bendy females to every non-bendy sweaty male – I like those odds, though I’m sure my lady classmates simply don’t even notice me (and really don’t care). I plan to persuade the owners to open a bar area, when it’s allowed. The ending of lockdown is, I am starting to genuinely believe, going to be a wake-up call to the whole world. Let me share a little anecdote, if I may. Lucky me, I live mostly in Barcelona. And a week or two into the first lockdown last spring, I actually sneaked up to one of the highest spots in town – a place called Montjuic. It’s where most of the facilities for the 1992 Olympics are, including the swimming pools, which are open to the public. It’s a real joy to pretend you’re an Olympic diver as you belly flop into the water with the entire cityscape as your backdrop. The Mediterranean is on one side, the mountains on the other. You should try it, when you’re allowed to fly here. Anyway, there were no cars on the road. No cruise or container ships leaving port spewing black smoke. There were no aircraft in the sky. I have been up there countless times but this time, I swear, it was like a punch to the solar plexus. Clean air, almost pure oxygen, filled my lungs and hit my blood stream. The sky was a crisp blue I have simply never seen before; the view seemed endless all the way up to the Costa Brava and on into France. And it was silent, utterly silent, aside from the birdsong, which was so loud I almost wanted to turn the sweeping and diving little buggers down. It was, to me, utterly indisputable that this is what the world is supposed to look like when we’re not spewing CO2 into the atmosphere. I hadn’t given it all that much thought before; climate change had always been someone else’s problem. But now it feels different, more imperative. And this was after only two or three weeks of emission control. In no time at all, the Earth was already dusting herself off and cleaning herself up. Anyway, my point. In November, world leaders will meet in Glasgow for the latestclimate change summit. And my guess is many of those stuffy old guys and boring old girls who rule over us and have the power to actually make change might have noticed this too. There’s no doubt that the pandemic will influence those discussions. There will be an urgency that would not have seemed so clear if 2020 and 2021 had been years like any others. Governments across the world have stumbled and, in Boris Johnson’s case, mumbled and bumbled, all the way through this Covid-19 crisis. But, guess what? Pretty soon, we will be free of it. Free and clear; the virus will be held back in the same way flu has been for ages. We’re winning. No, we have already won. We’re just waiting for the final whistle. We will be free to walk in the sunshine and see friends and family – enemies too. Won’t it be fun to actually punch one of these guys with a smile? The pandemic could prove to be the slap in the face we all needed, individually, and as a species. So, turn the TV off and start living, because there’s absolutely no excuse, really, for not wanting lockdown to end. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"4 Mar, 2021","‘Where’s our restitution?’ Ferguson activists & Mike Brown Sr. demand blacklivesmatter cough up $20 MILLION, a fraction of its global donations","A Ferguson, Missouri activist group and Michael Brown Sr. are demanding that blacklivesmatter shell out $20 million to local organizers, accusing the org of abandoning “freedom fighters” while it basks in the public spotlight. Tory Russell, who co-founded Ferguson’s International Black Freedom Alliance, appeared in a video alongside the father of the late Michael Brown on Tuesday, calling on blacklivesmatter ’s national leadership to send a cool $20 million to the IBFA and other community groups. “Today, we hold blacklivesmatter accountable. The movement that has catapulted into the limelight has forgotten about Ferguson and the freedom fighters,”Russell said, noting many local activists have become“political prisoners.” We’re asking that blacklivesmatter leadership fund $20 million for Ferguson organizers, organizations and community foundations to do the work. We’re not begging for a handout, we’re coming for what we deserve. Today our co-founder,#Fergusonfrontline organizer@VanguardTNTalongside#MikeBrown s father demands 20 million from#BlackLivesMatterin order to continue the work they and other have been doing since the uprising since 2014.pic.twitter.com/4rDA28ZKnB Russell said the funds would go toward“Black Panther-style”mutual aid programs, such as community gardens and farms, as well as “annual commemorations” of Brown, who was fatally shot by a Ferguson police officer during a scuffle in 2014, helping to propel the blacklivesmatter movement into worldwide prominence. He also suggested the creation of “organizing fellowships and stipends” so local groups can “fight white supremacy full-time.” “What kind of movement are we building when we’re saying ‘ blacklivesmatter ,’ but the freedom fighters and the families are being left behind?”Russell went on.“Where s our restitution, where’s our organizing, where’s our building of a movement?” The IBFA took to Twitter on Wednesday night with anupdate, saying it hadn’t yet heard back from the blacklivesmatter leadership but that a local chapter had reached out in“solidarity.”City and state-level blacklivesmatter branches have also sparred with the org’s Global Network, with a DC chapter issuing a blistering statement last November accusing the group of“undermining the work and integrity”of grassroots activists. “Despite millions being donated to the network, local chapters have lacked support & resources from national leadership. As a result, much of our local community work continues to be erased,”the DC outfit charged,insistingthe Global Network“is NOT accountable to local communities nor local chapters.” Nyota Uhura, a longtime activist from St. Louis – located some 12 miles south of Ferguson – told RT last July that the broader blacklivesmatter organization is effectively an ‘astro turfed’ movement that co-opts local activism in service of the democraticparty . “They overshadow the work of the grassroots, then they insert themselves as leaders and they go out in the media and claim to be leading these movements,”Uhura said, adding that establishment progressive groups“use the energy of our movement to push their agenda.” Between 2017 and 2019, the blacklivesmatter Global Network spent nearly $4.6 million on consulting, travel expenses and staff salaries, while just $328,000 was divided between dozens of local chapters and other“outside organizations,”accordingto documents obtained by the Daily Caller. A representative for the Global Network argued, however, that those figures did not reflect the“in-kind support”it gives to those smaller groups, and that more than $770,000 had been provided to local chapters between June 2019 and April 2020. The Global Network raised a whopping $90 million in 2020 alone, and, faced with harsh criticism from local branches, said in its latest“Impact Report”that it distributed nearly a quarter of those funds to chapters, adding that was well above the charity“industry norm.” The purported boost in funding did little to quell the internal rebellion within blacklivesmatter ’s local branches, as nine other chapters joined the DC organization in castigating the group’s leadership for a lack of support in transparency in November. In ajoint statement, the 10 branches charged that“most chapters have received little to no financial support from [the Global Network]”since its launch in 2013, and that limited funding had only begun in the latter half of 2020.

"3 Mar, 2021",Racist BABIES? Researcher reveals Arizona ‘equity’ toolkit that teaches ‘white fragility’ and other woke propaganda,"Arizona is recommending teachers promote ‘equity’ and social justice through an ‘antiracist’ agenda that sees racism in toddlers and recommends progressive and blacklivesmatter materials as the cure. An ‘equity and diversity’toolkitfor teachers, parents, and administrators posted by the Arizona Department of Education fully embraces the belief in“persistent racial biases in our society,” going so far as to demand of parents that they instill “antiracist attitudes and actions” from birth so their children don’t“absorb bias”from the world. The Department of Education recommends a reading that claims babies are not ""colorblind"" and that parents must instill ""antiracist attitudes and actions"" beginning at birth, in order for their children to not ""absorb bias from the world around them.""pic.twitter.com/6WsfMTKJMx Researcher Chris Rufo posted a series of screenshots of the materials from the toolkit on Tuesday. He points out that some of the materials claim that babies show the first signs of racism at three months old, or that white children“remain strongly biased in favor of whiteness”by age five. The Department of Education site said the schools“cannot expect each and every Black, Latinx, Native and Indigenous, and marginalized Asian child”to reach their full potential if they aren’t properly supported. Meanwhile, some of the reading it recommended argued that“all white people are white in the context of a society that continues to disadvantage people of color based on race”and that schools should promote an“antiracist white identity”instead. To define ‘systemic racism’,the toolkit uses YouTube videos from Act.tv, which describes itself as“a progressive media company specializing in next generation live streaming and digital strategy.” Among the recommended authors are Kimberle Crenshaw, who invented the concept of ‘intersectionality’, and blacklivesmatter Movement co-founder Patrisse Khan Cullors, whoat one pointdescribed herself as“a trained Marxist.”Viewing recommendations feature thecontroversialNetflix show ‘Dear White People’, among others. Rufo called on Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, to investigate the“radical”program, calling it“deeply ideological, anti-scientific, and morally bunk.” This is not the first school ‘equity’ program to be highlighted by the Seattle-based researcher, who has been waging something of a crusade in recent months against the Critical Race Theory-based social justice agenda. Last week, he pointed out a similar curriculum in Buffalo, New York public schools – and even got fact-checkers who sought to dismiss his complaints to admit the error of their ways. Last year, Rufo caught the attention of the Trump administration by highlighting the contents of sensitivity training seminars provided to US government agencies by various diversity consultants, leading to the September 2020 executive orderbanning“race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating”in the US government or the military. The Biden administration revoked that order immediately upon taking office, andmade‘equity’ – equality of outcomes, which requires discrimination against some groups and in favor of others – a cornerstone of its foreign and domestic policies. The kids won’t know how to read or do math but at least they’ll be woke.https://t.co/RevaJheoA9 Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

"1 Mar, 2021",School shooting reported on FIRST DAY back in the classroom in Arkansas,"Students were back in the classroom for less than a day in one Arkansas high school before a shooting broke out. One student was reported injured and the underage suspect has been taken into custody. The state of Arkansas last week ordered schools to reopen, as the threat of Covid-19 subsides. Watson Chapel Junior High in the town of Pine Bluff opened its doors to in-person learning on Monday, but any sense of normality was soon shattered when a shooting erupted. One student was injured, and police took the suspect into custody. The Watson Chapel School District described the shooting as an“isolated incident.” Parents are lining up to pick up their students at Watson Chapel Jr. High after the school lifted its lockdown. Multiple law enforcement agencies are still present on scene#ARNewspic.twitter.com/9wO9LScx26 As the coronavirus pandemic hit the US last spring, school closures inadvertently brought with them a halt to school shootings. March 2020 was the first March without a school shooting in the US since 2002, and a total of 10 school shootings werereportedover the whole year, compared to nearly five times as many in 2019, perCNN figures.

"25 Feb, 2021",Why Black Lives REALLY Matter: Corporate America is fueling race war to deflect attention from massive wealth inequality,"Racial strife in the US today is not a ‘grassroots phenomenon’ born out of exasperated relations between blacks and whites. It is a manufactured crisis being foisted upon the public at a time when populist ideas are in the air. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Ask the average person on Main Street to describe the biggest news story of 2020 and the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protests will probably take a close second place just behind the Covid-19 pandemic. That answer, however, is more of a reflection of the US media’s unmatched power for shaping the public narrative than an honest assessment of the real problems confronting Americans. Indeed, far more worrisome than racial tensions, and a virus with a 99.75 percent survival rate, is the colossal transfer of wealth to the golden 0.01 percent. Ever since Covid-19 made landfall in January of 2020, America’s 664 billionaires saw their collective worthexplodeto $4.2 trillion, a staggering 44 percent increase from just one year earlier. If ever there was a media story worth pursuing this was it. After all, that historic money grab was fueled by millions of hardworking Americans suddenly being ordered to shelter in place as their small businesses went up in proverbial flames. At the same time, monster companies like Amazon,WalMartand Louis Vuitton, ranked“essential”and apparently impervious to pandemic, happily filled the void. The gatekeepers have gone berserk. They want to gate keep your front door, the door to the restaurant, the schoolhouse steps, the porch of the church, the entry to the capitol, your access to online platforms, and even your mouth and nostrils. Next up: the zipper of your pants Instead of providing a critical assessment of that corporate takeover, the media ran defense for the robber barons, indulging the CEOs as though they were Roman emperors returning home in triumph from military plunder abroad. US News & World Report, for example, apparently confusing the outbreak of a deadly disease with a sporting event,calledguys like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates“the biggest winners of the coronavirus pandemic.”So much for critical journalism. Incidentally, the reason it was deemed necessary for small business owners to lay down and play dead, the ‘experts’ crowed, was to“save grandma”from the ravages of Covid-19 (in the most consequential presidential election cycle in many decades, no less). Yet, strangely, nobody bothered to ask grandma her opinion on the matter, nor did such concerns prevent infected senior citizens from beingdispatchedto nursing homes, which quickly became the main incubator for coronavirus deaths in the nation. But I digress. As cruel fate would have it, at the same time that the already insanely rich were counting their newfound bullion, George Floyd had the life crushed out of him under the knee of a white police officer. At this point, the media industrial complex could have navigated that tragedy into safe harbor, away from a proverbial shit storm, or straight into the rocks. Predictably, it chose the latter course, blaming Floyd’s death on ‘systemic racism,’ as opposed to other more probable explanations, likepoorly trainedandoverworkedpolice officers who are simply unprepared for the myriad challenges they face every day on the job. What followed was a prime example of the elite, with the complicity of the media, actively promoting civil strife to conceal the rapidly growing wealth divide. Race panic intensifying. No end in sight.https://t.co/nn9Fi7LDab US corporations – the very same entities that were doing gangbuster business amid the pandemic – beganstuffingthe war chests of various social justice groups, notably blacklivesmatter . The financier George Soros, who never met a social uprising he didn’t like, alsoopenedhis wallet to the tune of $220 million. The question must be asked: why would corporations sponsor blacklivesmatter at the very same time the latter was destroying and looting Main Street, USA as part of their“mostly peaceful”protests? Wouldn’t those donations have been better spent rebuilding the urban centers and SMALL BUSINESSES across the nation that blacklivesmatter ransacked? Perhaps, but that would have clashed with the media-forged narrative, predicated on the myth of ‘systemic racism,’ that is working to deflect attention away from an anti-establishment mood that has settled on the nation. Another method being employed to foment racial tensions is known as ‘critical race theory (CRT), by far one of the most sinister ideas to emerge from the liberal asylum of academia in a long time. In a nutshell, CRT postulates the notion that all white people, even if they don’t know it, have an inborn sense of racial superiority, which manifests itself in racism, the oppression of minority groups and card-carrying membership in some white supremacist group (at this point, take a moment and ask yourself how many ‘white supremacists’ you know). Banned by Donald Trump last year after it was discovered that CRT was being taught to government employees, President Joe Biden made it one of his first acts as president toreinstatethe radical progressive legislation. Wut.... this seems like blatant racial discrimination to this employment lawyer.https://t.co/IEmpycTP6P Now CRT is back in the spotlight with a vengeance. Just this month it was discovered that Coca-Cola isinstructingits employees to“be less white,”while a Buffalo, New York school district announced it willteachits pupils that“all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.”In short, here we have another one of those radical progressive ideas, much like the transgender movement, which is based more on raw emotions and feelings than any sound science. After all, are black people free of the purported chromosome that has motivated the loathsome white man to oppress minority groups over the centuries? Well, when it is considered that America’s first black president, Barack Obama,droppedover 26,000 bombs on seven foreign countries in his last year in office, while a number of other African Americans, including, but not limited to,Condoleezza Rice,Colin PowellandSusan Ricehave also been very casual about oppressing and killing foreigners, then the so-called ‘science’ behind CRT looks more like sheer quackery. So, what is really going on with regards to race relations in the United States? It is the opinion here, as stated earlier, that the elite, in an effort to deflect attention away from the greatest wealth heist in US history, are hyping ‘systemic racism’ lest the people start asking pesky questions about economic justice, which is certainly in shorter supply now than ever before. Thus, there is a concerted effort by corporations, media, academia and even Hollywood to arouse tensions between blacks and whites when in reality there is very little. That’s certainly not to suggest that racism does not exist in the United States. Of course it does. But to believe that it has reached epidemic levels is simply outlandish and unsupported by the realities on the ground. A rising tide of populism is swelling in the United States and the elite will do absolutely everything in its power, up to and including aggravating racial tensions, to keep the torches and pitchforks at bay.

"25 Feb, 2021",Paying the rioters and handcuffing police will only lead to more crime and more victims in minority communities,"Over the last year, the blacklivesmatter movement raised over 90 million dollars as police officers found themselves more restricted in their jobs. By doing this, society enables those who destroy it. is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC During 2020, several US cities were beset by riots. Millions upon millions of dollars of damage was done, lives were lost, all the while a chant of blacklivesmatter was ringing through the air. The organization who has made the chant its name raked in more than $90 millionin 2020. At the same time, we find people still chanting for the defunding of police. Here in my home state of Illinois, our governor has just signed a bill that will make it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs properly. The new law bans chokeholds, and does not allow police officers to purchase what the governor and the Democrats define as military equipment. These things include firearms of .50 caliber or higher and tracked armored vehicles. Given that caliber of round is largely only used in anti-materiel rifles, and Illinois police don t have a tendency to use actual tanks, the ban makes the ‘problem’ look bigger than it is. It s not just the letter of the law that is foolish, but the spirit as well. That and the massive amount of money that blacklivesmatter has brought in show two sides of a sickness plaguing the United States. To put it plainly, there does not exist a single argument to defend police brutality. The problem is blaming the wrong thing for a larger issue. Similar to the mistake made by Chicago activist Early Walker in his push to ban the video game Grand Theft Auto, Americans are blaming military equipment and chokeholds for issues and situations where those were not the problem. There isn t a place where police are gunning down people with anti-materiel rifles and running them over with armored vehicles. We re not a nation that s having a Tiananmen Square issue. We are in a place where bad cops need to be dealt with harshly, all the while not punishing the police officers who work diligently to protect their communities. Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of George Floyd showed a bad cop doing his job badly. Applying a chokehold does not necessarily show a cop doing his job badly. I very much believe bad cops should be punished, but is the hold the problem? Is the equipment the problem? Of course not. These are scapegoats that will solve nothing when banned, and in many situations the equipment and training that is available saves lives far more than it takes them. When a police officer is told that he could not use a rear naked choke to restrain a subject that is trying to harm him, you take away his options to protect his own life and the lives of others around him. The same can be said of certain bits of equipment used. But I wouldn t expect a politician to understand that. On top of that realization, where does that put the police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect the community? What message does that send to them? Where does that say our values are? It goes without saying that police should have accountability to the citizens, but it also goes without saying that we shouldn t be rewarding the people who don t defend the neighborhoods. It certainly doesn t incentivize people to become police officers, and it disenfranchises those who are already working the beat. A serious decision needs to be made in America. We as citizens need to decide whether or not we truly value our communities. Do we value them enough to be smarter about these situations? Do we value them enough to enable the people who want places to improve, and seek for the people who burn our cities to be punished? If you re listening to Democratic politicians in the year of our Lord 2021, I m afraid the answer to both questions is a resounding“no.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

After the officers put him in handcuffs, he began spitting at them and demanded they give him a gun. As his behavior grew increasingly erratic, one of the officers, Mark Vaughn, placed a spit hood around his head. During the ensuing altercation, the officer pressed Prude’s head to the ground, which led to his death due to“complications of asphyxia.”It was determined that his use of drugs contributed to his death.

"23 Feb, 2021","Wayne Dupree: Nations rise and fall, and America’s now in danger of falling. I’ve never been more pessimistic about its fate","Democrat attempts to overturn a certified election result that went against them in Iowa shows what hypocritical manipulators they are and reveals their real intent – to seize complete control over every aspect of our lives. Wayne Dupreewas invited to the White House to talk to President Trump on messaging to the black community. He was named in Newsmax’s top 50 Influential African-American Republicans in 2017, and, in 2016, served as a board member of the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump. Before entering politics, he served for eight years in the US Air Force. His website is here:www.waynedupree.com. Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow I’m 52 years old and have never been more discouraged about our country than I am now. I’m glad I’m as old as I am, because I pity the coming generations. Nations rise, and, sadly, nations fall. Good luck, youngsters. America is divided in a way we’ve not seen since for 160 years. Our elections are chaotic, Third World-ish and always in question. ‘Wokeness’ is destroying people’s lives and futures. Political correctness is being deployed as a corrosive, destructive tool by the left. Censorship and lying are the norms for our so-called media. Propaganda outlets like NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN, and sometimes even FOX, have undermined our democratic system and replaced it with media bias and bigotry against any and every conservative. blacklivesmatter and Antifa are being fully supported by Democrats and the likes of George Soros. The teachers’ unions are harming our children’s futures by blackmailing for more money and teaching leftist programs. A man who should be in an old people’s home is signing executive orders placed in front of him by leftists who are continuing to do everything they can to weaken the country. Who would implement directives that purposely harm their own country? The left is going to destroy voting and elections systematically, just as Rush Limbaugh predicted. If you find it hard to win elections legitimately, why not just get rid of them? They’re so damn inconvenient, after all. An illustration of what awaits us is the move by the Democrat-led House of Representatives to investigate whether they should remove the legitimate winner ofIowa’s2nd Congressional District, Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who won the district by just six votes. The race has the distinction of being one of the closest federal elections ever held. The beaten candidate, Democrat Rita Hart, has begged Nancy Pelosi to look at the election as she felt votes were improperly discarded. Politicoreported,“The House Administration Committee gathered Friday afternoon virtually to finalize the process by which it will adjudicate Hart’s claim, which was filed under the Federal Contested Elections Act. The committee has been largely silent since Hart first made her contest in December, but the hearing suggests preparing to review the matter further. At the center of Hart’s complaint are 22 ballots that her campaign says were improperly rejected.” A Democrat Lost By Six Votes, Now The U.S. House May Throw Out Election Results To Let Her Winhttps://t.co/fCrdKc1Tw8The U.S. House of Representatives is set to consider whether Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, the Republican winner in ...pic.twitter.com/KsjBb6Xu8n How is this even legal? If Congress has the power to ‘judge’ on its members’ elections, then what is the point in conducting elections where citizens vote for their chosen candidate? Contested elections should be decided by their particular electorate and not by people who aren’t even part of the contested district. In this case, the state of Iowa has certified that Miller-Meeks was the winner and is their representative. The House overturning it would mean stripping the state of Iowa and the people of their right to choose their representatives, in favor of just having the Democrat-controlled House choose whoever they wish – their own, of course. The House should have no say in this. I think we are witnessing how the socialist takeover will be handled. Democrats don’t like the outcome in Iowa because they didn’t cheat well enough to steal the victory; they twist and bastardize the Constitution until they get what they want. This is just a first step. The left will not stop until they get what they really need to achieve their complete control – to disarm us. The Second Amendment is in their crosshairs. So wake up, America. What they want is power over you. Democrats can create these shenanigans over elections because they know they will have cover from a mainstream media which serves as an arm of their party. ‘We the people’ need to focus our attention on the media. As millions of conservatives, we need to be organized to begin a prolonged internet barrage/swarming of all left-wing organizations’ websites, email servers, phones, etc. To be clear, I’m not proposing harm to anyone, just proposing how we as a large group can register customer complaints that can’t be ignored. But it has to be organized and widespread to have the desired impact. And the hypocrisy of all this Iowa stuff stinks to high heaven. When Republicans cry foul over elections, with proof of corruption and ballot stuffing, they’re labeled as ‘insurrectionists’ for trying to overthrow a certified election. When the Democrats do the same, without any proof, they’re hailed as upholders of justice and democracy. If that’s how they want to play it, how about we have an independent review of all such disputed elections and the irregularities around them? We could start with Georgia. I think that thorough investigations would produce a shocking number of overturned elections in favor of the usually-non-offending party’s candidates (aka, the Republicans). ​But the chances of the Dems agreeing to any independent inquiry into their dodgy election activities is zero, of course. Mark my words: The left and the Democrats are the greatest clear and present danger to our country, much more so than Russia or China or any other so-called enemy combined.

"22 Feb, 2021",‘Taking the knee can’t change systemic racism’: Ex-footballer John Barnes supports players deciding not to kneel (VIDEO),"John Barnes admits taking the knee can t ""change systemic racism"" and supports players finding alternatives, believing focus should be on combatting socio-political discrimination rather than isolated incidents of racial abuse. ByDanny Armstrong Danny Armstrong is a Moscow-based British journalist, reporter and presenter for RT Sport. Follow him on Twitter@DannyWArmstrong Barnes’ career with Liverpool, where he was twice a league winner, and England inspired generations of youngsters and future footballers, and at the time of his retirement from international football he had won more England caps than any other black player with 79 appearances for the Three Lions. The 57-year-old has been vocal on the issue of systematic racism that he believes has pervaded sporting institutions and the impact on sport of worldwide protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020. In the wake of Floyd s death, the English Premier League adopted the gesture of taking a knee before kick off, aiming to promote racial equality and show solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement. The decision was almost unanimously accepted but did not come without its detractors. Several high-profile figures, including Crystal Palace’s Wilfred Zaha, labeled the action“degrading”and insisted black players should instead“stand tall”.Championship teams Bournemouth and Brentford announced in club statements they would no longer partake in the custom, saying it had“run its course”. Les Ferdinand, a former England teammate of Barnes and now director of football at London team Queens Park Rangers – one of the first clubs to discontinue the action – said taking the knee had""been diluted""and dismissed it as a fad similar to a""fancy hashtag"". In an interview with RT Sport, Barnes agreed the gesture""cannot change systematic racism""and said he encourages players in all sports to find other avenues to do more than replicate a token gesture to highlight the issue within the game. “First of all, taking the knee highlights the problem, and it s been highlighting the problems since the George Floyd situation,""Barnes told RT Sport via Zoom. ""That s all. We can t do anything to change people s perceptions.Taking a knee, walking off or appealing or refusing to play can t change systematic racism when you have a policeman who is going to stop or shoot a black person because his perception of him, unconsciously or not, is that he s a crook. “He s not going to think to himself, if I shoot or stop this black person, the LA Lakers aren’t gonna play basketball so I m not going to do it. So all sport can do, because it s media tentative and high-profile, is highlight the problem. ""Now, we ve been highlighting the problem in the Champions League, passing it around the line saying no to racism for 15 years. And nothing has changed. “So if people feel that all they can do is highlight it, then take a knee. But if they feel they want to do more and taking a knee is a token gesture – and in many respects it is just a token gesture – if they decide not to do it because they want to do something else, I m fine [with that]. ""I wouldn t be taking a knee.However, I don t say that people shouldn t be taking a knee. But taking a knee does nothing apart from highlight the problem."" Barnes was careful to make the distinction between focussing on isolated events of racism and racial inequality, and insisted the finer details of discrimination lie much more deeply, such as the lack of available education for black people in the poorer, inner-city areas. Racism in football has been apparent in pockets of support such as when England’s UEFA 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia in 2019 was twice halted after the home section was infiltrated by neo-fascist groups who made monkey chants and Nazi salutes at England’s black players. Another more prevalent but less easily manageable problem has emerged on social media, where a number of players, including Manchester United’s Anthony Martial, Arsenal’s Willian and Swansea City’s Yan Dhanda, were among those racially abused on Twitter and Instagram after poor performances for their club. Barnes believes the problem is much deeper and says that the energy used to focus on numerous isolated incidents would be better centered on the root cause of the issue. He suggests opening a dialogue on socio-economic problems minorities face, as well as black-on-black violence in the inner-cites. “We have to analyze or decide what we think racial inequality is. Black kids in the inner cities can t get an education, access to housing, social care and jobs and are discriminated against every single day as they walk down the street. For me, that s racial inequality,""he said. “Now, while that s what we should focus on, we should also try to stamp out racist incidents as we see them. But for that black player who talks about racial inequality, who for six days of the week, six-and-a-half days of the week, can go to the front of any line in front of white people can get into any club, any restaurant will have doors open for him – is that racial inequality? “So we have to decide what we believe racial equality to be and what our focus has to be, from a planning perspective and a sporting perspective. “There are enough elite people talking about getting Bulgaria banned and getting some idiots off social media. How many people are talking about the real problem where kids are killing each other in inner-cities every single day? “We ve got to stamp out bananas [being thrown] on the field, but we seem to be not only highlighting but focusing all our energy and money on trying to get Bulgaria banned and trying to get a 12-year-old football fan sent to prison or trying to get some idiot who can t spell his own name, who is happy for people to talk about him by going on social media and abusing a black. ""The real problems that are happening in the inner-cities which has kept black people down for hundreds of years and willcontinue to do so which are being ignored. That, for me, is what I m interested in [working on].” One prominent figure in the fight against inequality is Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford, who has campaigned for poverty-stricken UK children to receive government subsidized meals during the Covid-19 pandemic. Barnes says more high-profile players such as Rashford should be using their platform to challenge government policy and help black people in the poorer inner-city areas, challenging disproportionate misrepresentation at a fundamental level and within the elite to benefit 99% of blacks, rather than just 1% . “He s the one who s doing it,""Barnes says of Rashford.""He s [saying], forget about race, it s an underprivileged situation whereby black kids are disproportionately represented in that sphere. ""He s talking about trying to change things for them. He s not talking about alternatives for him. And he s not also saying, I m going to give you £20,000 of my own money. “What he s saying is that he can use his platform to change government, principle, government policy, which he has done to then say, we re going to feed inner-city kids throughout the summer holidays. ""Imagine if more black players – not just athletes, superstars – were to do that. That would help 99% of the black community. We re trying to help 1% of the black community, and the elite are not doing that. So that s not what I m about."" As a player who inspired a generation of youngsters regardless of race, Barnes career mirrors that of current star Rashford s in more ways than one, as the two are now engaged in combating socio-political discrimination by using their platforms as prominent sports stars. Barnes thinks to ensure the message is carried to future generations, the focus should remain on making life better in the poorest areas of society. ""It depends on what continues to happen. [Rashford could] continue to look at social issues and take on a stance, saying I am going to try and help the black kids in a city kids in which are disproportionately represented. ""[He could] then say, well, what we need now is more black men in the boardroom, and more black managers ... forget about what s going on the inner cities, forget sports. ""This has been happening for 1,000 years: an elite group of people who wanted more power for themselves have used the people as an excuse to say, I will help the people by me getting more power.

"18 Feb, 2021",Bill Gates says Trump should be allowed back on social media ‘at some point’,"Microsoft founder and synthetic meat enthusiast Bill Gates has said former President Donald Trump should be let back on social media “at some point.” Trump himself thinks that social media has “become very boring” without him. “I think at some point he probably will be allowed back on and probably should be allowed back on,”Gates told CNBC on Thursday, more than a month after Twitter and multiple other social media outlets booted Trump from their platforms, with Twitter’s reasoning being that the president’s calls to protest the 2020 election results presented a“risk of...violence.” Gates is considered by many to be an expert on healthcare, agriculture, and disease control, despite his lack of qualifications in these areas. Now he’s evidently added free speech issues to his portfolio, telling CNBC that Trump’s allegations of election fraud were“weird”and“corrosive.” “But I’ll bet they’ll find a way to let him back on,”Gates added, before suggesting that, should the social media companies let Trump back onto their platforms, the former president’s content“may be labeled as false in a lot of cases.” Before Twitter led the charge to deplatform Trump, the site was also the first to slap warning labels on his tweets. Some had their sharing restricted, while others were removed altogether from the platform. Even before the election, Twitter targeted a number of tweets Trump posted about last summer’s ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ riots for allegedly“glorifying violence.” Even if Trump were allowed back on social media, Gates suggested that as time passes,“people’s interest in what he says may go down quite a bit.”Denied his favorite platform for mass communication, Trump has indeed remained quiet since leaving office, occasionally opining on politics in Washington via official statements. Trump’s most recent missive, which targeted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, retained his signature tone, however; he described McConnell as a“dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack”who“doesn t have what it takes, never did, and never will.” The former president also called in to several conservative news networks on Wednesday evening to mourn the passing of right-wing pundit Rush Limbaugh. During one conversation with Newsmax’s Greg Kelly, Trump declared that Twitter has“become very boring”since his suspension. Despite Gates’ prediction, Twitter’s Chief Financial Officer Ned SegaltoldCNBC earlier this month that Trump will likely remain banned from the platform for life, even if he runs for office again in 2024 and wins.“The way our policies work, when you re removed from the platform, you re removed from the platform,”Segal said.

"16 Feb, 2021",Los Angeles police hunt for alleged ‘Valentine’s Day meme’ mocking George Floyd’s death as lawyer demands APOLOGY,"Police in Los Angeles are scouring social media for a photo of George Floyd captioned ‘You take my breath away’ that was reportedly shared among its officers. The lawyer for the African-American man’s family demanded an apology. “This is beyond insult on top of injury – it’s injury on top of death,”attorney Benjamin Crump said in a statement on Monday, demanding an apology and that anyone who is involved with the meme be held accountable.“The type of callousness and cruelty within a person’s soul needed to do something like this evades comprehension – and is indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD.” The statement follows reports over the weekend that someone in the LA police may have passed around a mock Valentine’s Day message featuring an image of Floyd’s face and the questionable caption. A personnel complaint has been initiated and we are pursuing each allegation including interviewing the department member who brought it to our attention. In a series of tweets on Saturday, the LAPD confirmed that someone had complained about the image, and that there was a report it had been created by an employee. “At this point the Department has not identified any actual postings in the workplace or identified that it was in fact our department employee who created the image,”but they have“directed commands to survey the worksites” for any traces of it, the LAPD added, noting that they “will have zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” If found any employee or supervisor is directed to take possession and identify those present. The Department will have zero tolerance for this type of behavior. Police in Minneapolis, Minnesota tried to arrest Floyd at the end of May 2020, following a report that he tried to use a counterfeit banknote at a grocery store. As several officers sought to subdue him, one of them by kneeling on his neck, Floyd complained that he could not breathe. All four officers were fired the very next day and criminally charged over his death. By that point, however, blacklivesmatter protests had become violent and within weeks spread throughout the US and even overseas. Crump has represented families of men shot by police in a number of prominent blacklivesmatter cases, starting with Trayvon Martin in 2013 and continuing with Michael Brown and Tamir Rice in 2014, Terence Crutcher in 2016, as well as Floyd and Jacob Blake in 2020.

"14 Feb, 2021",‘We’ve opened Pandora’s Box’: Graham floats idea of impeaching Kamala Harris if Republicans retake House,"US Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) may have voted against impeaching Donald Trump, but he seems open to holding Vice President Kamala Harris to the same standard after the 2022 midterms. Appearing on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ Graham railed against the impeachment trial in the Senate, which ultimately failed, with the 53-47 vote not enough to reach a  ‘guilty’ ruling. He called it an“affront to the law”and“unconstitutional.” Despite its failure, however, the Trump-supporting Republican says Democrats have“opened Pandora’s Box”and leaders like Harris could pay the price. “We’ve opened Pandora’s Box to future presidents. And if you use this model, I don’t know how Kamala Harris doesn’t get impeached if the Republicans take over the House,”he said. Harris was brought up multiple times during the impeachment trial for her past promotion of a bail fund for blacklivesmatter protesters that released rioters who ended up rearrested on separate criminal charges. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: ""I don t know how Kamala Harris doesn t get impeached if the Republicans take over the House, because she actually bailed out rioters""pic.twitter.com/hoitBgrkXJ Graham’s apparent threat to Harris, mixed with his own disapproval of the standard used to try and convict Trump for“inciting an insurrection,”have many blasting the senator for hypocrisy, with many also rushing to Harris’ defense. “Well it only works if the impeachee is a Democrat, a woman or Black (in VP Harris’ case she meets all three of Jim Crow Caucus chairman @LindseyGrahamSC’s criteria,”MSNBC’s Joy Reidtweetedin response to a user asking how impeaching Harris could be possible. Graham: This was a reckless use of the impeachment process which should only be used in the most dire of circumstances and also we’re totally coming for Kamala Harris in 2023 just cuz.https://t.co/ejG5odr13l Wow ...@LindseyGrahamSCjust delivered this messaging gift to@dccc@RepSeanMaloneyon Fox News saying, “I don’t know how Kamala Harris doesn’t get impeached if the Republicans take over the House.”Every Republican candidate should be asked if they will impeach@KamalaHarris Trump turnt Lindsey into a traitorous idiot.https://t.co/bEGmbU9Ihp Others even suggested Republicans taking control of Congress could mean a chance to overturn election results in 2024. “Graham is correct about the stakes of the 2022 midterms: If Republicans take Congress, they could not only impeach Biden and/or Harris (though unlikely they’d have the votes to convict), they could potentially succeed in overturning the results of the 2024 election,”former Barack Obama speechwriter Jon Favreausuggested. Graham also revealed to Fox News that he’d spoken to Trump since the trial ended and suggested the former president will be actively involved in the republicanparty going forward. “I spoke to him last night; he was grateful to his lawyers. He appreciated the help that all of us provided. You know, he s ready to move on and rebuild the republicanparty ,”he said, adding the former president is“excited”for the 2022 midterm elections. Trump’s influence over the republicanparty has been a hotly-debated topic, especially in light of seven Republican senators voting to impeach on Saturday, and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) seemingly turning on his past support and giving a speech on the Senate floor saying Trump was“responsible”for the January 6 riot at the US Capitol – despite voting against impeachment – and suggesting he could be pursued in criminal court. Graham said McConnell’s speech could come back to haunt Republicans. “I think Senator McConnell’s speech, he got a load off his chest, obviously, but unfortunately he put a load on the back of Republicans,”he said.“That speech you will see in 2022 campaigns.” If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"13 Feb, 2021","Democrats BACKTRACK on vote to call witnesses at Trump’s impeachment trial, averting a potential political quagmire","Hours after a surprise vote to allow for calling witnesses in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, the US Senate agreed to enter into the record a statement that prosecutors considered critical, averting weeks or months of testimony. House impeachment managers and lawyers for Trump agreed on Saturday to enter as evidence a statement by Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Washington) describing what she had been relayed about a telephone call during the January 6 Capitol riot. The congresswoman said late Friday that when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) called Trump and asked him to demand a stop to the violence, the former president replied,“Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” pic.twitter.com/6N8vg5PRJz Although Herrera Beutler has publicly discussed her allegation with constituents, colleagues, and media outlets since last month, House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) said her statement necessitated calling witnesses because it was a critical piece of new evidence to help prove that Trump incited the riot. The Senate voted 55-45 to allow for witnesses – over the objections of Trump’s lawyers – with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and four other Republicans joining the Democrats in opening the door for testimony. The decision to instead settle for entering Herrera Beutler’s statement in the trial record put the case back on track to be completed as soon as Saturday. Allowing the lawyers to call witnesses was a potential double-edged sword for the Democrats because it would delay completion of the trial and potentially lead to more political theater, undermining President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. As Graham warned last week, the Republicans would demand to hear from a long list oftheir own witnessesif the Democrats pressed for employing subpoenas. Among the targets would not only be representatives of the FBI to testify about the alleged pre-planning of the January 6 Capitol riot and apparent security breakdowns – but also Democrat politicians themselves. Given that former President Trump is charged with inciting the riot with his political rhetoric, the Republicans want to examine what they consider the even more direct incitements of violence by Democrats. For instance, Vice President Kamala Harris was accused of inciting political violence last year when she promoted a bail fund to get blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioters released from jail. “How’s that notinciting future violence?”Graham asked.“Be careful what you wish for, my Democratic colleagues. Be careful what you wish for.” Before the agreement on Herrera Beutler’s statement, Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen said he would need to take depositions from upward of 100 witnesses, including Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California). As he angrily pounded his finger on the dais and demanded that the depositions be done in person, in his office in Philadelphia, he pronounced the city’s name“Phillydelphia,”setting off gales of laughter in the Senate chamber. Apparently confused by the response, he explained how depositions work.“I don’t know why you’re laughing,”he said.“It is civil process. That is the way lawyers do it.” ""That s the way it works, folks ... I don t know why you re laughing ... there s nothing laughable here"" -- the Senate chamber breaks out in laughter after van der Veen threatens to depose Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris not by Zoom, but in his office in Philadelphiapic.twitter.com/T0xiozHckE The Democrats appear unlikely to succeed in convicting Trump, which would require a two-thirds Senate majority, or as many as 67 votes. All but five of the 50 Republicans in the Senate voted for a motion to declare the effort to convict a former president unconstitutional. Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnell(R-Kentucky) reportedly told colleagues on Saturday that he would vote to acquit Trump. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Feb, 2021",Charges DISMISSED against two Buffalo cops for ‘assault’ on 75-year-old protester who broke his skull in fall,"Two Buffalo, New York police officers escaped criminal charges for shoving an elderly man during last year’s George Floyd protests. Their indictment for breaking his skull prompted the resignation of the city’s riot police unit. Second-degree assault charges against officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were dismissed, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn announced on Thursday. They remain on suspension and still face an internal disciplinary investigation, however. NEW: Charges against the two Buffalo Police officers who shoved a protester to the ground have been dismissed. He suffered a fractured skull after he was pushedhttps://t.co/dLH6RxxhjK The Buffalo Police Benevolent Association was“extremely pleased”that a grand jury decided to dismiss the charges, adding that McCabe and Torgalski“were simply following departmental procedures and the directives of their superiors to clear Niagara Square despite working under extremely challenging circumstances,”according to a statement quoted byWGRZ-TV. The two officers werechargedin early June 2020, after a video emerged of them confronting the 75-year-old Martin Gugino and pushing him away. Gugino, a social justice activist well known in the community, struck the pavement with his head and suffered a skull fracture, spending several days in hospital. As video of the incident made rounds on social media, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo denounced their behavior as“wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,”demanding that they be fired. There was tremendous public pressure on the police, in the light of blacklivesmatter protests spreading across the US in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota the week prior. Members of the Buffalo PD’s Emergency Response Team reacted to the charging of their colleagues as well, however. All 57 of them resigned from the unit, while staying on with the department. In an ironic twist, Cuomo’s Covid-19 lockdown prevented the grand jury from convening to investigate the charges for months, and once it was able to meet, Flynn said he had“higher priority cases”to handle. The two officers are""still suspended pending the conclusion of the internal investigation,""according to a city spokesperson. It is unclear whether they will be reinstated or let go.

"10 Feb, 2021",Mark Cuban ban on national anthem during NBA games will deepen US divide. But it’s only the start of a new un-American trend,"Singing ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ at sporting events may seem a bit cheesy, but it helped forge a bond between Americans that is rapidly fraying. So why did the NBA owner ban the tradition at the worst possible time? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Mark Cuban, billionaire software designer-cum owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team, welcomed fans back to American Airlines Center this week for the first game of the season when humans (remember that two-legged species?) were allowed to stand-in for cardboard-cutout spectators ever since the Covid-19 pandemic swept the nation last year. Mavericks fans were undoubtedly excited to experience some semblance of the ‘old normal’ – sitting in the stands, downing some beers, and feeling like the ‘Year 2020’ had all been a bad dream. Of course it would have been swell not to have to wear a mask between hotdog bits and and sips of Budweiser, but beggars can’t be choosers, right? And then something inexplicable happened, or, rather, didn’t happen. The giddy fans were never invited – as they had been hundreds of times before in the past – to rise and join in singing the famous ‘Star Spangled Banner.’ The Mark Cuban national anthem story is not a sports story its part of a much larger campaign against conservative values. The avalanche of negative attacks on GunsReligion National AnthemUS flag Are designed to demonize the brand and conservatives better fight back soon. For those Americans who may have forgotten their history, the anthem was penned on September 14, 1814 by the lawyer and upstart poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing “the bombs bursting in air” during a bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy. It isbelievedthat the anthem was first sung at a sporting event during the Cubs vs. Red Sox 1918 World Series. Admittedly, standing for the anthem was always a rather tedious and slightly comical affair, which forced fans to exert themselves at that divine moment when they were just getting comfortable in their seats. And as a symbol of patriotism, amid an inebriated stadium of rowdy fans, it certainly left a lot to be desired. But the thought of not joining in the patriotic sing-along was simply not something a person would ever think to do – unless, of course, they had a wish to be called a ‘commie bastard’ or something equally sophisticated from the peanut gallery. But just like that, at least for home basketball games in Dallas, Texas, the generations-old tradition had been abruptly scrapped without explanation. Most people, however, already have a good hunch as to the reason why. Cuban’s move comes at a tense period in US history when bread and circuses are no longer the main attraction in town; politics is – or, to be more precise, political correctness and cancel culture are. That much became apparent in 2017 when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee in protest against police abuse during the national anthem. The controversial gesture, which helped to divide Americans and the world of sports like never before, took off again last year with the death of George Floyd during an arrest by a white police officer. That videotaped tragedy catapulted the blacklivesmatter movement to front and center as the media provided a single explanation for the destructive riots and protests that ensued: ‘the rise of White supremacism and institutional racism.’ Marching in lockstep as is its penchant, the mainstream media never bothered to suggest alternative causes – like poor police training to handle the vast challenges they face every day – for the high incidence of Black deaths at the hands of the police. After all, white people also regularly lose their lives during brush-ups with the police. But I digress. Perhaps at a slightly less tumultuous time in American history – like when the former US president isn’t being dragged through a second impeachment following a fiercely contested election, and US cities aren’t struggling to rebuild in the aftermath of “mostly peaceful” blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests, and monuments to famous historical figures were are not being pulled down in the town square like it’s Baghdad circa 2003 – then perhaps Americans might – and that’s a very big ‘might’ – be willing to have a sensible conversation about shelving the national anthem during sporting events. They were never asked, yet it was they who fought all of the wars to keep Old Glory flying over stadiums. As things stand, millions of Americans now have the feeling, supported by empirical evidence, that everything that was once special and sacred in their country is being torn apart by radicals who have absolutely no attachment to the nation and history, imperfect as it may be. Mark Cuban, despite everything America has done for him, essentially flipped the bird to the US flag, its anthem and his own fans by hitching his star to the cancel-culture wolf pack. What is really illogical about his decision is that, from a purely business point of view, it’s like shooting his franchise in both feet. After all, US companies learned the hard way that the average American sports fan has absolutely no interest in being dragged into the middle of cultural wars during sporting events. That much was obvious when ticket sales plummeted at the same time the world of sports, as well as corporate America, was advocating fiercely on behalf of blacklivesmatter , as well as donating heavily to its dubious cause. Today, there is a noxious cloud of corporate greed that hangs over professional sports that was not so visible in the early days. In fact, it’s even tempting to suggest that Mark Cuban believed the singing of the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ was cutting into expensive television airtime that could be better used to hawk beer and automobiles. That would probably be wishful thinking. The bottom line is probably rarely taken into account when these outrageous moves are pushed on the people. CEOs like Mark Cuban have more money than they know what to do with, and they probably know that people will continue attending their spectacles no matter what happens. Source close to Mark Cuban says decision to not play Anthem before Mavs games isn’t because they don’t love U.S., but because many feel anthem doesn’t represent them, and they want to continue discussion of how to represent people from all communities when honoring U.S. at game. What these cancel-culture radicals really want – and are willing to pay any price to achieve – is for the United States to lose every ounce of its national identity, thereby making it much easier to absorb it into the borderless corporate global matrix. Say what one will about Donald Trump, but his very presidency – anchored on the slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ – was predicated on keeping America independent, something that the people now holding power do not want. Under Joe Biden and the progressive radicals in the democraticparty , which extends to the world of corporate power and beyond, I fear this disastrous, un-American tendency will become increasingly obvious in the next months and years.

"9 Feb, 2021","Amid internal meltdown at New York Times, ‘1619 Project’ creator doxxes reporter for digging into her own racially charged tweets","In the New York Times’ latest internal scrap, the paper’s leading advocate for critical race theory allegedly doxxed a reporter for calling out her hypocrisy, after a veteran journalist was forced out for using “the N-word.” Donald McNeil Jr., the New York Times top reporter on the Covid-19 pandemic, resigned last week. McNeil, it had been revealed, used a racial slur while on a trip to Peru with students in 2009. McNeil simply repeated the term after a student inquired about its usage, and the paper backed him up, saying he had no malicious intent. Nevertheless, he resigned after 150 employees demanded he be punished, writing in a letter that“our community is outraged and in pain.” Enter Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Times reporter behind the controversial ‘1619 Project’, a work that reframes the entire history of the US as one of white supremacy, and one which prompted former President Donald Trump to wage a government-wide war on the“toxic”ideology of ‘critical race theory’. In a deep-dive article into the Times’ internal strife, Washington Free Beacon reporter Aaron Sibarium discovered that Hannah-Jones had used the word“n***er”twice in a pair of 2016 tweets. While Hannah-Jones – who is black – didn’t use the word maliciously, she nevertheless escaped the scrutiny of her colleagues, who had told Sibarium that,“even in ironic or self-mocking quotations,”racial slurs and epithets would not be tolerated at the paper.“We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent,”executive editor Dean Baquet told staff in an email. Sibarium did some digging, and found that Hannah-Jones had used the exact same slur in 2016, while she was quoting black comedian Larry Wilmore. More insane behavior from Nikole Hannah-Jones...https://t.co/DQuoX1CNU5pic.twitter.com/uRx9dD4bTf He contacted Hannah-Jones, asking her whether her“intent made a difference”in this case. In response, Sibarium said Hannah-Jones posted his email on Twitter, along with his phone number, and joked about this with her followers. Hannah-Jones has taken down the tweet that contained my phone number. I appreciate that.But it took her over 24 hours to do so—and she clearly knew my number was out there.pic.twitter.com/EBdbPPwjpf By Tuesday morning she had deleted the tweet, along with her old tweets containing the word“n***er.”In fact, some users noted, all recent tweets going back to November 2020 also seemed to have been suddenly deleted. Nikole Hannah Jones seems to have nuked all of her tweets post November 2020. Whatever may or may not be happening behind the scenes, Hannah-Jones was pilloried by pundits and commentators online.“Just imagine the reaction if that were done *to* her rather than by her, even though she wields infinitely more power than he,”journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted. She left the email with his personal cell phone number up on Twitter for 24 hours, then deleted it. Obviously, he got messages and calls. Just imagine the reaction if that were done *to* her rather than by her, even though she wields infinitely more power than he. Uh oh! Didn t Nikole Hannah-Jones say that if you weren t part of a group, you couldn t use offensive words pertaining to them?CC:@deanbaquetpic.twitter.com/59uLcI0VCr NHJ is a joke, and the newspaper for which she works has blown out its decency and credibilityhttps://t.co/8Hheo6QjNZ Hannah-Jones left her tweet containing the phone number online for more than 24 hours, according to Sibarium. Heclaimsthat the doxxing was“more annoying than alarming,”adding that he had received“some nasty voice messages but nothing serious.” The New York Times has been in disarray of late, with the woke brigade and aging liberals duking it out for control of the Gray Lady’s agenda. The internal drama has been ongoing since the paper’s editors canceled andapologizedfor an op-ed last summer by a sitting US Senator, Tom Cotton, after the ‘woke’ staff claimed his article – which called for the deployment of troops to quash violent ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ riots – put their lives in danger.

"9 Feb, 2021",Doctors found that police played role in death of ‘French George Floyd’ Adama Traore – media,"The actions of French gendarmes contributed to the death of Adama Traore in police custody, according to a report cited by the media. The case sparked mass protests and riots in the country. The French media cited a report by four Belgian doctors commissioned by the investigators in the case. The doctors said they believed that Traore had“very likely suffered a heatstroke.”However,“the role in the lethal process of a period of suffocation due to physical constraint cannot be ruled out,”they said. They noted that the“momentary containment maneuvers”performed by the gendarmes, and“to a lesser extent underlying conditions,”ultimately led to the young man’s death. An excerpt from the report, cited by BFM TV, said that Traore’s condition would not have undergone a“dramatic evolution”if the officers had not pinned him down. It also said that the doctors believe the man suffered a heatstroke because he was placed in a situation of“brief but intense physical activity under adrenergic stress and atmospheric heat.” According to France Info radio, the experts found that the fact that Traore was handcuffed with his hands behind his back likely contributed to him developing serious breathing problems. In 2016, Traore, a man of Malian descent, went to celebrate his 24th birthday with his brother Bagui in the small town of Beaumont-sur-Oise to the north of Paris. Police drove up to the men while looking for Bagui in connection to a criminal case. Traore did not have ID on him and tried to run, but was caught. Three officers used their weight to pin the young man to the ground. He lost consciousness and died in police custody. An internal police investigation exonerated the officers involved in Traore’s arrest. Traore became a symbol of police brutality in France and was eventually dubbed the ‘French George Floyd’ in 2020 due to the similarities of his case to the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota that year. Floyd was pinned to the ground by an officer and was filmed by a bystander pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd’s death sparked massive protests and riots across American cities and abroad. In France, tens of thousands protested Traore’s death and marched in solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement in the US. The rallies were also coupled with rioting in Paris.

"8 Feb, 2021","Political ‘personality cults’ are bad for democracy and rule of law, Pope says, citing events of 2020","Pope Francis condemned political cults of personality and said mature democracies must ensure the rule of law prevails over political interests, in what was widely interpreted as a condemnation of populism. “The development of a democratic consciousness demands that emphasis on individual personalities be overcome and that respect for the rule of law prevail,”the head of the Roman Catholic Church said on Monday, in an annual speech to ambassadors accredited to the Vatican. Mature democracies should shun political personality cults, pope sayshttps://t.co/Fo02hGa9uspic.twitter.com/KM8YPTxRtO “Indeed, law is the indispensable prerequisite for the exercise of all power and must be guaranteed by the responsible governing bodies, regardless of dominant political interests,”he said, according to Reuters. Events over the past year“in countries with a long democratic tradition”have shown that democracy demands“inclusive, peaceful, constructive and respectful dialogue among all the components of civil society in every city and nation,”he also said. The pope’s remarks were quickly and widely interpreted as a condemnation of former US President Donald Trump and populism in general. Strong condemnation of Trumpian politics from@pontifex. “The development of a democratic consciousness demands that emphasis on individual personalities be overcome and that respect for the rule of law prevail”#RuleOfLawhttps://t.co/bmQHixtjg7 One of them was from Reuters itself, which included a line about how recent years have seen the rise of populism“in the United States, Latin America and some European countries.” However, the pope did not name any names or go into the specifics, leaving his words open to interpretation. Populists are hardly the only ones to bend the rules and laws to suit partisan ends orelevatepolitical leaders to cult status rivaling the Vicar of Christ on Earth himself. Pope Francis’s admonishment against personality cults may sound strange to some since it comes from the person whom Catholic doctrine regards as the supreme authority after God, infallible in matters of religious faith. However, he has not shied away from political pronouncements since ascending to the Holy See in 2013. Over the past year, the pope has also declared sympathy for open borders, denounced capitalism, endorsed same-sex civil unions, praised blacklivesmatter and championedsocial justicecauses. Most recently, he hascondemnedthe refusal to get vaccinated against Covid-19 as “suicidal denial” – suicide is a sin in Catholicism – and blasted those traveling for the holidays as selfish and uncaring.

"7 Feb, 2021",On Contact: People s history of West Virginia,"On the show this week, Chris Hedges talks to filmmaker and journalist, Eleanor Goldfield about herdocumentary,""Hard Road of Hope"". Goldfield’s documentary,""Hard Road of Hope"", revisits West Virginia’s long tradition of radicalism and militant unionism, including the famed 1921 armed uprising, the largest since the Civil War, by some 10,000 coal miners at Blair Mountain who fought the repressive coal owners and their hired coal company gun thugs and militias. In 2018, the state’s 20,000 public school teachers and employees carried out a strike over low pay and high health-care costs, shutting down every public school in West Virginia until their demands were met. The strike inspired similar teacher strikes in Oklahoma, Colorado and Arizona. These contradictions, and what they mean for a nation fragmenting into antagonistic tribes, are explored in the documentary. We apologize for the audio quality due to technical issues which failed to meet our regular quality standards. YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook.com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/on-contact-1 Eleanor Goldfield:One of the problems is, is that people walk into places like West Virginia and they say, ""Let me tell you what you need to know.""  Nobody wants to be talked to like they re stupid, you know.  And I think that this is the problem is that people talk down to people a lot of the times particularly in these pro-White communities and they tell them it s your fault because you re a coal miner.  Well, no, if your choices are work in coal or watch your family starve and go homeless I think anyone of us would make that despicable but necessary decision.  So I think this understanding of where our solidarity actually lies and that is, you know, together in trying to survive and ultimately thrive as oppose to trying to draw these lines or these barriers that divide and conquer us in the name of the corporate state because they just love looking down at us and seeing us, you know, throwing stones at each other rather than punching up. Chris Hedges:Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Primary Contest in West Virginia in 2016 won all of the state s 55 counties.  And yet in the 2016 election Donald Trump took 68.5% of the vote, his largest share of the vote in any state against Hillary Clinton who received a paltry 26.4%.  We don t know if the 2016 win by Sanders would ve been repeated in 2020 since by the time of the Primary, Sanders had suspended his campaign.  But the 2020 Presidential contest in West Virginia between Joe Biden and Donald Trump also saw a Trump landslide with Trump receiving 69% of the vote to Biden s 30%.  West Virginia is the second poorest state in the nation between 2014 and 2017 the drug overdose death rate in West Virginia increased from a rate of 35.5 per 100,000 to 57.8 per 100,000 far exceeding any other state in the nation.  The Center for Disease Control and prevention named 28 West Virginia counties in the nation s top 220 at risk counties for HIV and/or hepatitis C due to the opioid epidemic.  Much of the Southern part of the state has been turned into a toxic waste dump by coal companies.  But despite the fervent support for Trump, West Virginia also has a long tradition of radicalism and militant unionism including the famed 1921 armed uprising, the largest since the Civil War by some 10,000 coal miners at Blair Mountain who fought the repressive coal owners and their hired coal company gun thugs and militias.  In 2018 the state s 20,000 public school teachers and employees carried out a strike over low pay and high health cost shutting down every public school in West Virginia until their demands were met.  The strike inspired similar teacher strikes in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona.  These contradictions and what they mean for a nation fragmenting into antagonistic tribes are explored in the new documentary film Hard Road of Hope.  Joining me to discuss Hard Road of Hope is the film s director, Eleanor Goldfield.  So, as you know I wrote a chapter of Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt my book out of West Virginia.  And I don t think it s too extreme to describe the landscape which you show in your film as apocalyptic layout what the devastations that--that s been done, what it looks like and what its consequences have been for the people who live there. EG:Well, thank you so much for having me, Chris, I really appreciate it.  And, yeah, the destruction is absolutely apocalyptic and as one of the folks in the film says, Paul Corbit Brown, he says that if you were to stretch out all of the destruction via mountain top removal it would stretch--it would be eight-tenths of a mile wide and it would reach from the White House to San Francisco.  That s how much devastation has been caused just by mountain top removal which again is not--it s not the typical mining way that it s been done since, you know, the turn of the--turn of the century and the precipitated, you know, the mine wars that you mentioned.  So the destruction just recently has been astronomical and not just from coal but from fracking as well and while fracking looks not as horrific from the air for instance as a--as a decapitated mountain does.  The destruction is massive when you consider the, you know, the gathering pipelines, the amount of water that is used, or the amount of water that is poisoned via the fracking process.  So West Virginia is, you know, it called in the film a resource colony and that s really how it was founded that s what it continues to be.  It is being absolutely decimated by the coal industry and the oil and gas industry for the sake of corporate profit.  And that continues not just in terms of the ecosystems there which Appalachia is the second most bio diverse region in the world.  It s not just the ecosystems but of course the people who are part of the ecosystems and, you know, there s one--there s one place Prenter Hollow for instance that 98% of the people living there got gallbladder disease because of the poisoned water due to--due to coal mining processes.  So, yeah, the devastation is both in terms of the natural resources and of course the people who live there. CH:So we wanna be clear with mountain top removal you re blowing the tops off of mountains about 400 feet.  And although they talk about reclamation there really is no reclamation.  The--you mentioned the toxic waste, you ve got billion gallon impoundment ponds filled with carcinogens, heavy metals, and then of course the water is poisoned, cancer is an epidemic.  I remember going into the elementary schools and there are just rows of little inhalers in the nurse s office for the children.  It is a totally devastated environment and yet and you deal with this in your film.  It is for activists who rise up even within that environment, it s extremely hostile that there s this whole notion of Friends of Coal.  And, you know, I m--I ll let you talk about it but because there are so few jobs and when they talk about coal jobs what they re talking about is heavy equipment operators, 25-foot story tall drag lines which take the tops off of mountains.  But that s where I wanna look at and I think your film does a good job of that kind of contradiction but talk about it.  Talk about how yet even in the midst of all of this environmental degradation and the health effects and everything else you have this fervent defense of the coal companies themselves. EG:Yeah, it s--the psychological aspect of that is really impressive and not in a good way.  And Friends of Coal the organization that you mentioned was created by big coal.  To create this cultural connection to coal that really precipitates the pride and oppression.  You know, there s--people take pride in the fact that they get black lung, it means that they worked hard, you know, it means that they ve done a good job to keep the lights on in the United States as a nation, you know.  And in the film there s also a former coal miner who makes the distinction, you know, what they should--what people should be having, you know, bumpers stickers on their car that says ""It s friends of coal miners.""  Not Friends of Coal because Friends of Coal means you re friends with the coal corporations.  And friends of coal miners is a completely different story.  But the deep propagandization which of course has also lead to, you know, this being a hotspot for Trump voters suggests that we ve got--in the course of a couple of generations we ve gone from people who, you know, would shudder if you said the word scab to people who proudly put out a Trump flag and are--and are proud of these right to work type laws and are proud to not have any regulation and see it as a cultural connection to the coal industry.  And so this is also why it s become so difficult for renewable resources to make a foothold even with the people not just, you know, in terms of the politicians, that s a whole another story but in terms of the people.  Because as somebody says in the film people feel when you re saying no to coal you re saying no to them as human beings because they have been brought up with this deep--this deep connection to coal that, ""Oh, you are the machine that keeps the nation running.  You are the machine that--you are the epoch of this predominantly White, you know, this White salt of the Earth worker that is this Americana, this American dream, this ideal."" And so this has been really hammered home for folks.  So when they--when they re told that coal is bad they take it actually personally.  Which is why you see when a--when a coal company for instance completely railroads their workers and basically cuts them off without a dime, no back pay, no health insurance anything like that, they ll say, ""Oh, that s a bad company.""  But coal overarchingly is good because look what it s done for us, you know, it fed our family and put our kid through schools and things like that.  So it really, really speaks to the deep propagandization and of course the amputation of the past, you know, you--again you mentioned the mind wars people aren t taught about that, people aren t taught about the radicalism that they actually come from in that region and that, no, in fact the enemy is the coal companies, the enemy is the coal industry that tries--that has continued to try to oppress us for so long.  They ve been totally amputated from that past and the effects of an amputated past are very, very clear in West Virginia today. CH:We should be clear on West Virginia the coal companies most of which are huge multinationals that are not headquartered in the state have managed to buy off all the politicians they vet and largely write or censor the textbooks so as you said people are not taught their own history, they control the courts.  These were just utter--I was just stunned, it s utterly complete.  And of course they have the resources to pump out this propaganda that at once as you said fosters this historical amnesia but also this notion of any criticism of coal becomes a kind of attack on West Virginia itself.  And yet this was one of the most radical spots in the country.  You had miners picking up Winchester rifles.  And they finally sent in the US Air Force under Billy Mitchell to bomb them and the US Army.  And you saw figures like Mother Jones coming down to speak to the miners, she was a hero to the miners.  How would you say we got from that moment to a moment where these people are backing Trump, why did that happen? EG:Yeah, there s a great quote from Wilma Steele who s in the film, she s the--she works with the Mine Wars Museum in Matewan, West Virginia which is, of course, where the Matewan Massacre happened and was pivotal in the mine wars.  She said, ""If you burn a man s house to the ground he ll rebuild, but if you take away his history then you take away any sense of who he is.  And then you basically take away the person, the man."" And I think that that is--that is incredibly important, this is of course something that, you know, that you ve done a lot of work with too, is like the history of places and the--our collective understanding of history, obviously, dictates how we view our past and how we then build our future.  And so it s been, you know, as you noted it s been a very distinct attempt and, you know, one that s worked well for them by the coal companies, to amputate people from this past.  And instead say that, you know, for instance ""Oh, if you like electricity then you like coal.""  As if that s the only way that we can get our energy.  Or, you know, we have to be--we have to promote--it s kind of like Support Our Troops, like support our coal miners.  We want them to have jobs right?  And, you know, this combination which we see with the oil and gas industry too.  It s about jobs and it s about energy.  And if we did--if we get rid of coal then we will have neither of those and so the--instead of blaming, you know, the coal industry for giving people black lung and cutting regulations, people have started to blame, you know, for instance the EPA for having any regulations, as if their regulations were really stringent anyway.  Same thing with Obama, they blamed Obama for placing, you know, ""regulations"" when in reality Obama like a lot of the Democrats do is they state that they re placing regulations when in reality they re, you know, they re fluff, like, for instance Obama s coal regulation was that you can t leave coal slurry that the toxic waste from coal washing, you can t leave that in an unlined Earth and dam for more than three years.  Well guess what after three years there s not that much to clean up because it s already leached into the ground and into the ground water and everything.  But then Obama gets to go out there and say, ""I made a coal regulation.""  So this is--this is--this is classic Democrats and it s also classic coal industry to say, ""Oh, look we re not the enemy.  Look they re the enemy, they re trying to steal your jobs.  They re trying to steal your livelihood."" And that deep propagandization then as you noted because the politicians are chosen by coal, that that is then parroted by the politicians themselves.  So people just continuously hear jobs, and jobs, and energy, and money, and you want your kids to eat right?  So it becomes this, you know, this deep connection to that.  And so you ve--again, like, over the course of a few generations you go from, you know, Black and White mine workers marching together and firing on their--on their oppressors to people being proud of that oppression and having completely lost that trail of the radical past. CH:Great.  When we come back we ll continue our conversation about the contradictory roots of West Virginia with film director Eleanor Goldfield.  Welcome back to On Contact.  We continue our conversation about the contradictory roots of West Virginia with Eleanor Goldfield.  So to what extent would you say that this shift was caused by a betrayal on the part of, in particular, the democraticparty establishment?  Because I think these people were betrayed. EG:Absolutely.  I think it s a deep betrayal of, you know, by the Democrats, by the system really.  And I think that it s--it also speaks to the deepening connections between corporate America and the politicians themselves that there is really no--there s no--there s no line between them anymore and, you know, as Mussolini said that fascism should more rightly be called corporatism.  It is this tightening of these connections that really start mimicking this sort of--this fascist enterprise.  And part of that is a deep propaganda machine that is, you know, put out there on behalf of corporate America which is also on behalf of their, you know, their chosen politicians.  And, of course, this is, you know, this is a similar story which is really the kind of--the point that I also wanted to make with the film is that this is an American story. You know, you--I ve had people in Ohio, Colorado, California, Washington State tell me, ""Oh, I recognize my story in this story.""  And so this is a story that s been replicated, you know, by industries all over the United States.  You might be able to say that the coal industry has done it really to a--to a T that the oil and gas industry then gets to copy, which they are, but yeah, I think this betrayal runs very, very deep.  And it s even more sickening to me and also to folks that I ve talked to, not just in West Virginia, but primarily in the South which is where I grew up and also where I work a lot, is this feeling that it s particularly disgusting on the--on--with the case of the Democrats because the Republicans don t claim to care.  They don t--they don t walk out there and say we really believe that blacklivesmatter or we really believe that workers rights matter.  They don t say any of that.  The Democrats do however, so it s actually more sickening to folks that the Democrats are willing to stand there and say we believe in you and we want you to have healthcare, we want you to have living wage, and then don t do anything about it.  And I think--I think that also--that also supports this sort of shift away from the democraticparty and the shift towards Trump, but it also speaks to why, you know, as you mentioned in the introduction why Bernie was popular because he was speaking to people and speaking to their actual needs as opposed to this lip service that the Democrats are known for.  So I think this is why you see people that would ve voted for Bernie vote for Trump because of this deep seated distrust in particular in the democraticparty for their decades of betrayal. CH:I wrote a chapter in my last book, America: The Farewell Tour, out of Anderson, Indiana which was the center at one point of the GM--production of GM cars.  They all moved to Monterrey, Mexico after NAFTA.  And again, you had overwhelming support among old UAW workers for Bernie Sanders but then they voted for Trump.  And I want to explore that but first, I just want to ask, which I think you addressed in the film, the left often writes off people from West Virginia.  Much of my own family comes from Maine, rural Maine, as to use Hillary Clinton s words, you know, as deplorables, as just irredeemable racists, and I think you ask us to look at them in a different way. EG:Yeah, absolutely.  I grew up in North Carolina around, you know, poor White folks and I think that it s possibly one of the biggest pitfalls of leftism particularly environmental and labor rights organizations and movements that they write these people off because, you know, as a--as a good friend of mine Kiilu Nyasha once pointed out we can t do this without White folks.  I hate to admit it but we can t.  And so this idea that we should write these people off because they are poor, because they have been oppressed by the state and because they re, you know, misguided or miseducated, well, then what part of the United States would you be able to organize with?  Because we ve all been oppressed in different ways.  We ve all been lied to by the state.  And I think one of the problems is, is that people walk into places like West Virginia and they say, ""Let me tell you what you need to know.""  Nobody wants to be talked to like they re stupid, you know, and I think that this is the problem is that people talk down to people a lot of the times particularly in these poor White communities and they tell them it s your fault because you re a coal miner.  Well, no, if your choices are work in coal or watch your family starve and go homeless, I think any one of us would make that despicable but necessary decision.  So I think this understanding of where our solidarity actually lies and that is, you know, together in trying to survive and ultimately thrive as opposed to trying to draw these lines with these barriers that divide and conquer us in the name of the corporate state because they just love looking down at us and seeing us, you know, throwing stones at each other rather than punching up.  So I think one of the things that I ve learned, not just in West Virginia, but in places like Louisiana and North Carolina is, you know, walk into these communities and ask them what they--what they need and talk to them as a--as a--as a--as an equal, not talk down to them and say it s your fault that you re in this--in this horrible position because you work with X, or Y, or Z. CH:Well, I think one of the attractions of Bernie Sanders platform was that it would have dealt with the health crisis that is afflicting places like Southern West Virginia, not just the opioid addiction which is massive but also Black Lung Disease and then, of course, all of the diseases caused by environmental degradation, cancers as you pointed out, gallbladder problems, and he was proposing universal healthcare.  So that addressed a real need and that s, of course, something now the Biden administration has walked away from. EG:Yeah, absolutely.  Well, Biden has basically said, you know, I am the democraticparty and the democraticparty does not believe in universal healthcare.  And actually his ""expansion"" of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, would be more expensive than Obamacare already is.  And it would also be more expensive than universal healthcare because when one out of every three dollars you spend is going to unnecessary administration costs, of course, it s going to be more expensive than just saying, yeah, you re born until you die, you just have healthcare.  And this is something--again, this is something that really spoke to people in West Virginia because another, you know, another point is that a lot of people who have to claim bankruptcy do so because of medical costs and a lot of people who do that actually had insurance.  So this idea that, you know, the ACA was affordable or caring is, of course, a lie.  And a lot of people in West Virginia were anti, that I spoke to, were anti the Affordable Care Act because they recognized that it was neither affordable or caring.  So when someone like Bernie Sanders came in and said actually, you know, forget these--all of this.  You have to be this old to do this and this.  Just forget all that.  You should just have healthcare.  That speaks to their needs, you know, these people that have very physical--physically demanding jobs and that are suffering from things like black lung.  And not only that but, you know, as you mentioned, the opioid crisis have the need for pain management and things like that.  This is--this was something that really spoke to them that, you know, oh, you don t actually have to continue working.  You could leave your job and still have healthcare, which is, of course, a really sick way that people end up sticking with their job is just to maintain their healthcare.  So yeah, these were--these were definitely things that people resonated with, not to mention the, you know, the idea of a just transition, the idea that, oh, maybe my kids won t get black lung when they re 40.  Maybe they can actually work with something that s more sustainable or more green.  The idea that all coal miners want to work and they want to, you know, perpetuate, this is also just a fallacy.  A lot of people want to--want to move forward and progress and do a more renewable energy kind of platform and just don t see a way and don t trust the Democrats to take them there rightfully so. CH:I saw the film as really a kind of cautionary message to the democraticparty that the longer you fail to address the very pressing and immediate needs of an impoverished population, we re now talking half the country, you re right, that this is replicated in communities around the country, the more you re going to see people reach out to demagogues like Trump just out of pure frustration. EG:Absolutely.  And I believe it was Ajamu Baraka who recently posted that, you know, I hate to say it folks, but neo-liberalism is fascism.  And these sort of policies, we see the same thing in Europe where I also spent some time growing up.  Neo-liberal policies like austerity and things like that lead to fascism.  And, you know, I think that that s very clear here and you have people reaching out, demanding or begging for legitimate progress and the Democrats are just falling back on this sort of, you know, the concepts of neo-liberalism while paying some lip service to the concepts of progress and people are not swayed by it.  And so instead, they go to the party that seemed to have, you know, more strength, more of a spine, and then unfortunately the only choice there because of our really rigged two-party system is that the republicanparty which, you know, really houses overt fascism as opposed to neo-liberal brand of fascism that the Democrats have, and, you know, and those are your choices, it doesn t really leave a lot of--that doesn t leave a lot of space for things and again, like, with Trump, he actually did speak to people.  He spoke to people from a different angle but he spoke to people about getting jobs and he actually saw them, you know, a former coal miner pointed out to me that, you know, Hillary Clinton never cared and it was so obvious.  But Trump actually went there and he seemed to care.  He seemed to look out at the crowd and say I see you, I hear you.  We re going to bring back coal as if that s something you could even do.  But the fact is that they felt that he cared.  And so this is the--this is the same thing that they felt about Sanders.  They actually felt seen and heard.  And when neither party is really doing that but you have a figurehead like Trump that you feel is really hearing you, you re going to--you re going to go in that direction and I think you see that happening just like, you know, people have done in the past, so I think, yeah, it s incredibly dangerous the way that our system is set up and I don t expect the Democrats to listen.  But what I do hope is kind of what the film points out too is that there are ways to make it politically untenable for either party to withstand the demands of the people.  And that is embedded in the history of West Virginia and it s something that is continuing to be worked on presently.

"4 Feb, 2021","Canada declares the Proud Boys a terrorist group, as blacklivesmatter is nominated for the Peace Prize. Now, watch racial tensions explode","Canada’s dramatically dropped the bar on what it defines as terrorism, adding the Proud Boys to a list that includes Al-Qaeda and ISIS, while blacklivesmatter is practically canonized. Is this the way to kill political dissent? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Considering that the foundation of US politics is now constructed almost entirely from the aggregate of half-truths, propaganda, and partisanship, it should come as no surprise that the news headlines are starting to reflect that sorry state of affairs. Case in point is Canada’s outrageousdecisionto designate the Proud Boys group as a terrorist entity, punishing the“white supremacists”for their participation in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Founded in 2016 by the Canadian media personality Gavin McInnes, who has since distanced himself from the group, the Proud Boys now rank alongside the likes of Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Canada’s rogues gallery of global baddies. Ottawa’s designation, which reeks of foreign meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, begs a serious question: has Canada forgotten what terrorism looks like? Ask any person on the street to describe an act of terrorism and their answer will likely include references to deadly attacks on innocent civilians, such as the 2017 suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena in England that left 22 people dead, and the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks that claimed 130 lives. Have Canadians forgotten the series of attacks on September 11, 2001 that struck the financial and military heart of the United States, leaving some 3,000 people dead? Hopefully not, because that cold-blooded act of terror was responsible for getting Canada bogged down in the longest war in its history. As a member of a US-led international coalition against Al-Qaeda in the mountains of Afghanistan for 12 grueling years, Canada eventually lost 158 soldiers and 7 civilians in the course of the fight. For anyone who may have forgotten history, that is what terrorism looks like. It is almost tempting, however, to excuse Canada for jumping the terrorist shark, as it were, considering the hysterical rhetoric emanating from its dangerously divided neighbor south of the border. Ever since January 6, when a horde of disaffected Trump supporters, among them members of the Proud Boys, descended on the Capitol building for the Electoral College count, the democraticparty and its ever-loyal sidekick, the mainstream media, have been selling that incident as an act of Trump-sponsored ‘terrorism’. Such is the incredible power of the person or party that has the media industrial complex in their back pocket. But I digress. NBC News’ house historian, Michael Beschloss, was just one of many media personalities and politicians who recklessly characterized the events on Capitol Hill as a“terrorist attack”ordered by then-President Donald Trump (who, coincidentally or not, is up for his second impeachment this week). “This was a president of the United States inciting an insurrection, a terrorist attack on Congress,”Beschloss said, without the slightest hint of irony, before dropping the 9/11 bombast.“We observed 9/11, we remember … an effort to fly an airplane into the Capitol and kill a lot of members of Congress. That almost happened. Here is a terrorist attack [on January 6] that did happen.” On both September 11, 2001, and January 6, 2021, terrorist haters of democracy tried to attack our Capitol and Congress. But on January 6, they actually managed to invade the building and put our leaders and our democracy in danger. We had a close call and must never forget. In yet another cheap attempt to politicize the event, House lawmaker Adam Schiff (D-CA) stood on the floor of Congress and conflated January 6 – a day that will certainly live in infamy for the Democrats – with some of the most pressing challenges that have ever confronted the nation. “America has been through a Civil War, world wars, a Great Depression, pandemics, McCarthyism, and now a Trumpist and White nationalist insurrection,”Schiff said with all of the solemnity he could muster. Let’s be clear: to lump together the Proud Boys with some of the biggest names in the terror business is a self-defeating gesture – a case of crying wolf – when it comes to fighting terrorism. Although they will never be confused as boy scouts, aside from a couple arrests for their involvement in street brawls, the Proud Boys have never carried out a premeditated attack on any individuals or individuals, to say nothing of orchestrating suicide bombings, hijackings, or other mass killings, which is the modus operandi of modern terrorism. This is not an apology for the group – just the simple facts. So, why is Canadasingling outthe Proud Boys as a terrorist organization when left-wing groups such as blacklivesmatter and Antifa – organizations that have acquired global reach, as well as financial clout – are responsible for carrying out real violence in the United States? Could the answer be that the liberal government of Justin Trudeau is only too happy to crush a right-wing group of largely Trump supporters, perhaps as a gift to the new US leader, and especially as impeachment proceedings against Trump are about to begin? And with talk of the Biden administration preparing to roll out a ‘domestic terrorism law’, the move by Canada will certainly help in those efforts. In any case, regardless of what happens, radical left-wing groups, no matter how much violence and destruction they spawn, will remain above the law. That much was obvious following the death of George Floyd in May 2020 at the hands of a white police officer, as blacklivesmatter went on a nationwide tour, looting and burning large swaths of the country. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, for example, three nights of riotingresultedin 400 buildings being damaged, at an estimated cost of $500 million. In Portland, Oregon, blacklivesmatter and Antifa staged violent protests outside the federal courthouse – government property, just like the Capitol building – where demonstrators clashed with National Guardsmen and other federal agents in scenes every bit as chaotic as those witnessed on January 6. To top off the anarchy, an entire city block of Seattle was taken over by left-wing protesters and declared, ironically enough, the ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone’ – a short-lived experiment in police-free living that was soon disbanded after the citizens of this utopia started getting randomly killed by their own. Meanwhile, through the tear gas and mayhem, the media continued to provide ground cover, as witnessed by CNN’s description of the wanton violence and destruction as“mostly peaceful protests.” Damn. I was watching CNN the other day, and I thought:Involves a Viking hat: That’s a coupInvolves burning small businesses and government buildings to the ground: That’s a mostly peaceful protest How was blacklivesmatter awarded for their handiwork? With an outpouring of massive corporate sponsorshipamountingto tens of millions of dollars, which could have been better spent rebuilding the destroyed neighborhoods the pack left in its wake. In fact, the outpouring of support for blacklivesmatter , which seems to think that destroying neighborhoods is the way forward, has even included a nomination for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. Incredibly, at the same time Canada awarded a predominantly white, right-wing outfit of US political malcontents with the yellow badge of ‘terrorism,’ a left-wing group of pro-black activists that isn’t shy about resorting to violence to promote its message is in the running for one of the most prestigious and honorable awards in the world. If I’m not mistaken, I’d say that, instead of working to promote a world of peace and stability, some very misguided politicians have just succeeded in driving up racial tensions – and possibly even the threat of terrorism – by several degrees. So, what’s the reason? Are they trying to conceal something – like maybe the great wealth divide,made even greaterduring the Covid pandemic – by focusing attention on the ‘racial divide?’ Or is this yet another symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome, even though the divisive populist has been effectively removed from office? Or, finally, can such inexplicable moves be put down to a case of sheer stupidity? Whatever the case, the inexplicable move by the government of Canada to designate a group of protesters as ‘terrorists’ sends a very bad signal to the world, and does not bode well for the future of democracy and race relations.

The former Nobel secretarytoldthe AP news agency in 2015 that in awarding the prize to Obama, “the committee didn t achieve what it had hoped for.” You don’t say? Yet, one of the biggest jaw-droppers may be a current contender, the corporate-fundedMarxistfront group, blacklivesmatter . The nomination must make blacklivesmatter ’s sponsors proud. And how much do corporatesocialistslike blacklivesmatter ? As ofJune 2020, corporate America had pledged blacklivesmatter over $1.678 billion, led by Bank of America and cheap-labor lover Nike. blacklivesmatter was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian lawmaker. NBC Newsreported: “In his nomination letter, Petter Eide, a Socialist Left member of the Storting, Norway s parliament, wrote that he had nominated blacklivesmatter ‘for their struggle against racism and racially motivated violence.’” By now, much has been said about blacklivesmatter ’sviolentroots. Idiscoveredattempts by blacklivesmatter (and its enablers) to disguise its history and ideology. But blacklivesmatter ’s scrubbing of its shady past has been to no avail, since its goals and tactics were on full display in the blacklivesmatter -inspired riots. Protests and riots, including looting and arson,rampagedthrough the US from May to December 2020. The violence that resulted in theaftermathof the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis was the first “multi-state catastrophe event” ever declared for civil disorder by claim-tracking company Property Claim Services, Triple-I has said. iSnatch?

Dead cops. When do we want it? Now!” On August 29, 2015, during a blacklivesmatter marchoutside the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul, a chant rang out: “Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon.” Inspired by blacklivesmatter , at least two police officers were murdered, one at point-blank range. On September 16, 2020, Axiosheadlined: “$1 billion-plus riot damage is most expensive in insurance history.” But noted in the report was the obligatory leftist cover for those who looted and set many cities ablaze. “The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims.” In late August 2020, CNN infamously pushed the “mostly peaceful” mantra while a reporter was standing in front of a burning building in Kenosha, Wisconsin. CNN’s font actuallyread, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.” In May 2020, MSNBC’s correspondentstoodin front of a building on fire in Minneapolis, during a blacklivesmatter riot. Ali Velshi said, ""I want to be clear on how I characterize this. This is a, mostly a protest. It is not, it is not generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started.” Dedication to the elimination of the family unit, chants to murder cops, the death of at least 19 people, and one to two billion dollars in property destruction – all this seems to have escaped the notice of the Norwegian lawmaker. Or maybe it hasn’t. Perhaps this is the all-encompassing goal of “social justice” – to destroy the fabric of the social body in order to “build back better.” And so, should blacklivesmatter win this coveted award, their honor should henceforth be known as the Nobel ‘Mostly Peaceful’ Prize.

"1 Feb, 2021","Facebook leak: Zuckerberg admits having TOO MUCH POWER but cheers new administration, seeks to WORK WITH BIDEN on key issues","Project Veritas has posted leaked videos exposing internal talks at Facebook lamenting the company s admittedly excessive power but at the same time seeking to use its influence to “work with” President Joe Biden s administration. ""These were all important and positive steps,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said of the executive orders on immigration, Covid-19 and other issues that Biden signed right after being inaugurated on January 20.""And I am looking forward to opportunities where Facebook is going to be able to work together with this new administration on some of their top priorities, starting with Covid response."" Zuckerberg added that Biden was quickly taking action""on areas that we as a company really care quite deeply about and have for some time,""such as immigration, ending restrictions on travel from predominantly Muslim countries with inadequate security-screening capabilities, and advancing""racial justice and equity."" The comments came from internal meetings at Facebook that Project Veritas, an undercover journalism outlet, obtained through an unidentified source. The Q&A meetings with Zuckerberg and other executives occurred in January – one on January 7, before Biden took office, and the other on January 21, just after he was installed as president – and Project Veritas founder James O Keefe said his company s Facebook""insider""remains on the job and aims to expose more secrets. The discussions gave no appearance of political objectivity. For instance, Zuckerberg gushed over the election of the first female and non-white vice president and appeared to take some credit for making that happen, saying that""despite the challenges that we are facing as a country, we all have so much to be proud of."" In contrast, Zuckerberg blasted former president Donald Trump for using his last days in office""to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power.""He argued that the protesters who participated in the US Capitol riot on January 6 somehow got preferential treatment from law enforcement.""It was troubling to see how people in this mob were treated compared to the stark contrast we saw during ( blacklivesmatter and Antifa) protests."" The riot wascoordinatedlargely on Facebook, according to a Washington Post report. Ironically, even as Facebook works to help bring about its desired policies, executives admitted that the company has excessive power. Nick Clegg, Facebook s head of global affairs, conceded that politicians from such countries as Germany and Mexico have expressed""disquiet""about the power of Big Tech to control public discussion. He said Facebook agrees with the argument that private companies should be making decisions in a way that is framed by democratically agreed rules and principles. ""At the moment, those democratically agreed rules don t exist,""Clegg said, apparently overlooking such frameworks as the US Constitution. Guy Rosen, vice president for integrity, said Facebook has a program to""freeze commenting""on threads when its systems detect""hate speech""or violence. New censorship tools are among advances that Facebook has made in the past three or four years in""the integrity space, our efforts to protect elections,""he said. Facebook Vice president for civil rights Roy Austin suggested using Oculus virtual-reality technology""to help a white police officer understand what it feels like to be a young black man who s stopped and searched and arrested by the police.""He added,""I want every major decision to run through a civil rights lens.""

"30 Jan, 2021","Two shocking headlines that sum up Covid: Billionaires MADE $3.9 trillion during the pandemic, while workers LOST $3.7 trillion","The economic impact of Covid-19 on regular folk across the globe is as devastating as the physical toll it has taken, but we can’t just blame the super rich(er) for our woes – the true villains are much closer to home. In a simple comparison, two headlines seem to say it all about the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis: the first, fromBusiness Insider, reads“Billionaires made $3.9 trillion during the pandemic”while the second, fromThe Guardian, shouts“Covid-19 has cost global workers $3.7 trillion in lost earnings.” A classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, it would appear at first glance but of course, the world doesn’t work that way and the two ideas behind the headlines are not directly related, no matter what your bicycle-riding, woolly-sweater wearing, craft-beer-quaffing socialist pals might say. But that doesn’t make the news any easier to swallow. Frankly, I couldn’t care less about the world’s billionaires, and maybe one day soon I won’t have to. They seem intent onmovingto Mars in their big rockets where their wacked-out ideas and dreams of a super-race can become a problem for the little green men to deal with. However, their surging wealth has become a headline writer’s dream. Added to those already cited, the BBCtrumpetsthat the increase in wealth of the 10 richest men in the world during the pandemic would cover the cost of vaccinating every single person on the planet. It’s not fair! It’s just not fair! But it is no use bleating about this. It’s our fault. Stuck at home while riding out this damned virus, we’ve been online around the clock, buying stuff we don’t need to have it delivered by Amazon, streaming hours and hours of online entertainment, addictively watching Tiktok and furiously messaging on social media, all activities that are unwittingly causing a boom in stock prices for all those global tech giants and their oddball owners – people like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Bill Gates. Not everyone is cashing in our boredom. Nope, there are serial investors out there who pre-pandemic already suffered from the condition of having way too much money at their disposal. People who share the outlook of 19th century American robber baron, John D. Rockefeller whoadmitted,“I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity.”Men like Warren Buffet, the so-called Sage of Omaha, who has made more than $20 billion since last March. Unfortunately, his good fortune comes not by selling anything the rest of the world can use – like free care homes for the elderly and vulnerable or a reliable Covid-19 vaccine that everyone clamours to buy – it’s through smart investment of his existing billions. All this would be easy to shrug off – oh well, that’s just the way it is – if it wasn’t for the incredible tsunami-like impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on our national economies and our everyday lives that can be seen with a cursory glance at the graphs and tables that chart such effects. While we each come to terms with our own new normal, the collective overview is alarming. Every major economy is struggling withrisingunemployment. Up 11 percent in Italy in 2020 compared with 2019. Nearly nine percent in the US and France. Some 5.4 per cent in the UK and 4.3 in the European powerhouse, Germany. Across the globe, shoppers have vanished with retail footfall down 97 percent in Germany, 78 percent in the UK, 65 percent in France and Canada, and 20 percent in the USA, the biggest economy on the planet. Global tourism has been crushed, with 2020 a total washout for everywhere from Thailand to Brazil to Italy and France. The airline industry? Devastated. This means millions of jobs lost, many of which may never return. There is no need to go on. Unless you’re a billionaire, let’s face it, the figures suck. You can believe that as a result of the collapse in our economies, and the jobs that have followed down that big black hole, lost earnings from workers could quite easily total that estimated $3.7 trillion figure. You’d have to bet it will be even higher once the various government-backed furloughschemesand income support grants inevitably come to an end in countries like the UK. It would be fun to paint the world’s billionaires as evil puppet masters bent on global domination and the development of a Mars-bound master race, sucking up the wages of the world’s workers so they can buy more rocket fuel and mansions built into mountains, but sadly the reality is far more prosaic. All governments were caught criminally flat-footed by this pandemic and everyone has subsequently paid a terrible price. Years of complacency, cuts to public health budgets and dismissive approaches to warnings of a global pandemic are what got us where we are. The shambolic handling of the Covid-19 crisis cannot be blamed on crooked billionaires scheming away in their secret island hideaways, but can be laid at the feet of the very politicians that we ourselves elected, operating in plain sight. It is essential that we remember this the next time these true villains want something from us – like votes – or we risk this all happening again. Think your friends would be interested?

"29 Jan, 2021", blacklivesmatter movement nominated for 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian MP,"The blacklivesmatter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian MP Petter Eide, who claims the impact of blacklivesmatter ’s anti-racism rallies has been felt far beyond the US alone. “I find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,”Eide said. blacklivesmatter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice. In his nomination papers, the MP hailed the movement for its ability to“mobilize people from all groups of society,”including in his native Norway, where some 12,000 people attended an Oslo blacklivesmatter rally in June. blacklivesmatter was initially founded in 2013 in response to George Zimmerman being acquitted of the murder of unarmed black US teen Trayvon Martin, who he shot dead in Florida in 2012. The movement gained traction following the killings of other black people, including George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in July last year after officers put him in a chokehold, sparking global blacklivesmatter -led anti-racism protests. Under therulesfor the prestigious gong, any politician serving in any national government or assembly can enter nominations. The deadline to submit nominations is February 1, and the chosen Nobel Laureates will receive their prize at an award ceremony on December 10 in Oslo. The 2020 prize was given to the World Food Programme for its efforts to combat hunger. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"23 Jan, 2021","Facebook BANS UK Socialist Workers Party, revives account with ‘no explanation’ as dozens of local pages remain suspended","The UK’s Socialist Workers Party was temporarily booted from Facebook, restored hours later with no explanation given for what the left-wing org deemed a “silencing of political activists.” Dozens of related pages remain banned. The party said its main account, as well as its local pages, were deactivated on Friday, calling the move an“attack”while demanding the profiles be“reinstated immediately.” “Facebook has shut down the accounts of one of the biggest left wing organisations in Britain,”the SWP said in apress release, adding that“dozens of leading SWP activists”were simultaneously kicked off the platform. Those targeted say it amounts to a silencing of political activists. BREAKING:@Facebookhas shut down a major left wing group in Britain.Why is Facebook silencing political activists who speak out for#Palestineand#BlackLivesMatter? Read the press release here:https://t.co/4wJZMKFr9J#FacebookCensorship While the party said Facebook provided no rationale for the move, it noted that its page often posts“in support of Palestine, blacklivesmatter and against Boris Johnson’s Covid policies,”arguing it was“silenced for speaking out on these issues.” Hours after the SWP announced the inexplicable ban, itsaidthat Facebook had“backed down”and reinstated its national account, however“dozens of SWP activists and local branch pages”still remain suspended. A party representative told RT the company had still provided“no explanation”for the string of suspensions, even after its“partial climbdown.”Facebook did not immediately respond to RT’s request for comment about the decision. Friday’s ban, moreover, is not the first time the SWP encountered troubles on the platform. In December, some 45 party activists were purged from the site, though Facebook ultimately said those bans were“in error”and most of the accounts were revived, the SWP said. The socialist outfit is one among tens of thousands of profiles to be expunged from Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram in recent months, with the companysayingit scrapped more than 78,000 accounts between August 2020 and January 12, 2021 alone. Some 37,000 Facebook pages and groups were also deleted over the same period, part of the platform’s drive against what it calls“militarized social movements.”While much of those efforts have been focused right of center – targeting theQAnon conspiracy communityin particular – it has also gone after thousands of left-wing accounts, including those of Antifa and other socialist organizations. Former President Donald Trump, who left office on Wednesday with Joe Biden’s inauguration, was also slapped with a ban on Facebook earlier this month after his supporters staged a riot on Capitol Hill. The decision set off alarms among free speech advocates and civil libertarians, with famed national security whistleblower Edward Snowdenwarningit could be a“turning point in the battle for control over digital speech.” Think your friends would be interested?

"21 Jan, 2021",‘Did Antifa blow through there?’ TIME cover depicts Biden s first day in Oval Office ransacked by Trump,"TIME magazine made its view of Joe Biden’s presidency clear with a new front cover depicting the president’s “day one” in an Oval Office that’s been vandalized as he looks out at a country on fire. The image shows papers stacked and strewn about on the floor, a disconnected phone, and spray-paint vandalism across the room as Biden stoically looks out a window to see nothing but flames. On Twitter, the image also comes with the sound effect of the disconnected phone. Why the stoic Biden would not turn around and simply hang the phone up in case he gets a call is unclear. “Is the Oval Office in Seattle? Did blacklivesmatter -ANTIFA blow through there?”author Derek Hunter tweeted in reaction to Thursday’s cover, referencing left-wing protests by Antifa and blacklivesmatter that have turned to violence and attacks on businesses. Is the Oval Office in Seattle? Did blacklivesmatter -ANTIFA blow through there?https://t.co/PCHMPHXi4r “Good luck being United when the mainstream media acts like a bunch of toddlers,”journalist Trish Regan wrote. Others called the image out for flying in the face of Biden’s repeated calls for“unity”and showing a deep-seated bias in coverage, only one day into the Democrat’s term. I’m not pro trump nor pro biden but i feel this is exaggeration and bias.

Al-Qaeda was accused of killing nearly 3,000 Americans at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. How can five deaths that happened during the Capitol unrest compare? Silence, bigot!

Joining the Democrats in this crusade are the neocons, from the NeverTrump shriekers Max Boot, Bill Kristol and David Frum – architects and instigators of the original WoT and the Iraq invasion launched under its pretext – to Bush alumni who worked on the inside to sabotage Trump’s agenda until they decided denouncing him would profit them more. One of them is Elizabeth Neumann, a Bush alum embedded in Trump’s Homeland Security department until she resigned in a huff last May, who denounced her former boss inTIMEmagazine as near enough the equivalent of OBL. If you thought social media bans, no-fly lists, denials of service by banks and hotels, and mass layoffs were bad, wait till you hear former FBI agent Ali Soufan. Interviewed in the same TIME article, he gushed about the drone strike President Barack Obama ordered against Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011, saying he had it coming because he was“instigating”terrorism. Al-Awlaki also happened to be an American citizen and, therefore, ostensibly entitled to due process, but his extrajudicial execution was conducted with absolute impunity. Stanley McChrystal, who pushed Obama into the Afghan surge that killed over 1,000 soldiers, says the problem in our society is white males reacting to lost privilege, compares Trump supporters to the Klan. Not the line he took when he was selling his war.pic.twitter.com/CJ9NnMaQfZ Some veterans of the“war on terror”are all too eager to see it happen domestically. General Stanley McChrystal, who oversaw the deaths of more than 1,000 US troops in Afghanistan during the“surge”there, now says the problem with America is white men angry about losing their“privileged position,”and claims Trump supporters are the KKK. Who could’ve guessed thatIlhan Omar(D-Minnesota) had won the war for the hearts and minds of the US military? Then again, McChrystal has already been waging war on Americans, albeit of the psychological kind. Back in May 2020, the Washington Postreportedthat he was advising a Democrat group called Defeat Disinfo, which was“planning to deploy technology originally developed to counter Islamic State propaganda in service of a domestic political goal,”namely, the election of Joe Biden. The mainstream media saw nothing wrong with this, just as they cheer the calls to outlaw half of America now. WaPo 2016: ""Democracy dies in darkness""WaPo 2020: ""Actually darkness is good""pic.twitter.com/OaI144vubw Not that the mainstream media will remind you, but the original War on Terror resulted in mass warrantless spying on Americans – eventually exposed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden – and war crimes in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, exposed by Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. It also led to the massive expansion of administrative searches and seizures – from airports onward – and encroachment on civil liberties. These were all denounced as a bad thing. All of that pales in comparison to what has already been done by private companies in the name of“resisting”Trump, and what the incoming government is preparing to do, with zero pushback from civil libertarians such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which is now fully onboard. Well, not exactly zero. The one objection came from a somewhat unexpected quarter: the“Squad”of progressive members of Congress, who wrote aletteropposing any expansion of domestic national security and surveillance powers. The existing laws, powers and regulations are quite enough to go after“white nationalist and QAnon groups,”they argued, since“increasing the reach and power of our national security apparatus now would only serve to further the oppression of Black, brown, Indigenous, people of color, and leftist groups.”The What is just fine, it’s the Who/Whom that’s the problem, you see. With the notable exception of the Squad’s virtue-signaling – that is unlikely to accomplish much to shift the Democrats leftward – the very same people who once compared George W. Bush to Hitler are now rehabilitating his acolytes and policies, and echo his September 2001 message that“either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.” The pinnacle of irony is that in the very same speech, delivered before Congress, Bush said the  terrorists attacked America because“they hate our freedoms”– specifically citing“our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.” With those freedoms now effectively abolished in the name of protecting Our Democracy, does that mean the terrorists have no reason to hate America? That’s one way to win the ‘war on terror’ – just in time to start another, at home. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"17 Jan, 2021","Harvard students & alumni petition university to REVOKE DEGREES of Ted Cruz, other grads who supported Trump’s election claims","Not content to demand that political enemies be disbarred and banned from campus, Harvard University students are petitioning for the degrees of Senator Ted Cruz and others who challenged the 2020 election results to be revoked. A petition has begun circulating to demand that the university nullify the degrees of such graduates as Cruz (R-Texas), US Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Thepetitionersargued that by supporting President Donald Trump s allegations that Democrat Joe Biden s election victory was fraudulent, the Harvard graduates helped create a“white-supremacist uprising”at the US Capitol. Cruz, a 1997 Harvard Law School graduate, spearheaded an effort in the Senate to force an investigation of alleged fraud in the 2020 election. Both Cruz and Crenshaw demanded an end to the violence during the January 6 Capitol riot. While Crenshaw supported an amicus brief asking the US Supreme Court to hear a lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden s win, he also congratulated the president-elect after electoral college ballots were cast on December 14 – andblasted Trumpand other republicanparty members for leading protesters to believe that Congress could overturn the election s outcome. As White House press secretary, McEnany spoke for Trump in alleging that Biden s victory was driven by hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes in swing states. “Harvard values democracy, equality and the rule of law,”the petitioners said.“Does it value them enough to hold its own alumni accountable for the most flagrant attack on these principles in recent history?”The group repeatedly attributed the election-fraud protest to skin color,asking,“Is Harvard University prepared to take a stand for representative democracy and against violentwhite supremacy?” The campaign to revoke degrees follows a petition earlier this month – led by Yale and Harvard students and alumni – calling for Cruz and Yale alumnus Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) to bedisbarredfrom practicing law because of their election challenges. Civil rights lawyer Valarie Kaur said she supported the petition, even as Biden calls for unifying the politically polarized country, because there can be“no healing without accountability.” No healing without accountability. Our petition of Yale/Harvard alum calling for Hawley & Cruz to be disbarred for “leading the efforts to undermine the peaceful transition of power after a free and fair election"" & attacking the foundation of democracy:https://t.co/X8iwn68o3D Separately, Harvard professor Ryan Enos called on the university president, Lawrence Bacow, toblockthose who“encourage the violent overthrow of our own government”from being affiliated with the school. Students also demanded that the political pariahs be banned from speaking engagements at Harvard and from serving as Harvard Institute of Politics fellows. The university removed US Representative Elise Stefanik (R-New York), who supported allegations of election fraud, from the Institute of Politics. The latest petitioners acknowledged those moves but demanded more. Merely banning someone from campus“still grants them the benefits of their Harvard degree everywhere outside of Cambridge.” Supporters of the petition have pointed to a precedent for their demands – Harvard s 2010 revocation of alleged Russian spy Andrey Berzukov s degree. That argument equates making allegations of election fraud to obtaining a degree under a false identity and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The petitioners said their demands aren t partisan because“the acceptability of violence in politics should not be up for debate at Harvard.”There were no such petitions at Harvard over thegraduateswho may have had some role in inciting or carrying out the political violence seen in blacklivesmatter and Antifa riots across the US last summer. To the contrary, the university and its students and alumni embraced the blacklivesmatter movement. While the petitioners contended that“a Harvard degree is a privilege, not a right,”former Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier said it s neither a privilege nor a right.“It is a fact,”he said.“Heap well deserved scorn on Cruz et al, but the petition to revoke their degrees is absurd and puerile and should be embarrassing to signatories when they grow up.” A Harvard degree is neither a privilege nor a right. It is a fact. Heap well deserved scorn on Cruz et al, but the petition to revoke their degrees is absurd and puerile, and should be embarrassing to signatories when they grow up.https://t.co/9qLJGmtFss Other observers said they were alarmed that the petition was signed not only by young students, but also by mid-career professionals.“The un-personing purges in the West will continue until all bend the knee,”one commenter said.“To your point, this must come with a heaping helping of cognitive dissonance.” The unPersoning purges in the West will continue until all bend the knee.To your point, this must necessarily come with a heaping helping of cognitive dissonance.

"17 Jan, 2021","Despair, depression, and the inevitable rise of Trump 2.0: Glenn Greenwald tells RT his Biden administration predictions","America, Joe Biden says, “is back.” Beyond the sloganeering, journalist Glenn Greenwald reckons that means “militarism, imperialism, and corporatism,” he told RT’s Chris Hedges. Glenn Greenwald is a lawyer who turned to journalism in 2005to protestthe suppression of Americans’ civil liberties under the Bush-Cheney ‘war on terror’. Greenwald came to international fame by breaking the Edward Snowden NSA whistleblower story in 2013. He later co-founded the Intercept, but quit the outlet in October after saying editors there suppressed his coverage of Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden. “I don’t think it’s particularly difficult... to know what to expect from the Biden administration,”the acclaimed American journalist told Chris Hedges, host of RT’s On Contact, on Sunday. Biden, Greenwald continued, has enjoyed a five-decade career in Washington and made his policy priorities well known over these years. Biden is“somebody who has repeatedly supported militarism and imperialism”and“one of the crucial leading advocates of the invasion of Iraq,”he said. On the domestic front, Biden is“a loyal servant of the credit card and banking industry”and the“architect of the 1994 crime bill,”the latter of which has been blamed for dramatically upping the incarceration rate of black men in the US. That leftists involved in blacklivesmatter protests rallied around Biden, given his involvement in passing the crime bill (he was one of 61 senators who voted for it) is“ironic,”Greenwald told Hedges, but also serves as an example of how the democraticparty operates. “Democrats are very good at creating a brand that is radically different than the reality, but essentially the democraticparty serves militarism, imperialism, and corporatism,”he said.“That’s who funds them, that’s what they believe in. It’s why you see neocons migrating so comfortably back to the democraticparty , why you see Bush and Cheney operatives cheering for Joe Biden, why Wall Street celebrated when he picked Kamala Harris.” Biden’s campaign didn’t only draw support from the left – who Biden then spurned by packing his cabinet with Obama administration alumni while giving progressives like Bernie Sanders the cold shoulder. The former vice president was also supported by Republican hawks like Bill Kristol and Max Boot, as well as the much-maligned ‘Lincoln Project’ Republicans, who fundraised$67 millionto shoot attack ads against Trump in the runup to November’s election. The rallying of the establishment – Democrat and Republican alike – behind Biden could have far-reaching consequences, Greenwald warned. “It’s not a coincidence that after eight years of Obama and Biden, we got Donald Trump,”he said.“Obviously, if you go back and do exactly the same thing that the ‘Obiden’ administration did for 8 years, which is what Biden’s preparing to do, any rational person has to expect the same outcome.” The American middle class, Greenwald predicted, will“continue to be destroyed,”while companies“that have no allegiance to the US”will continue to outsource jobs.“Communities will continue to be ravaged with unemployment crises, drug addiction, suicide, depression, all the things that are dominating small American towns.” After what Hedges called a“third term of the Obama administration,”Greenwald warned that Biden could set the stage for a“smarter, more stable version”of Trump to take power. Americans looking for in-depth coverage of the Biden administration will likely be short-changed. Four years of Donald Trump have birthed left-leaning journalists that cheer on the censorship of conservatives and deplatforming of“dangerous”voices, Greenwald believes. The left, he said, shows little objection to Biden because they“bought into the overarching narrative that there are only two choices – unite behind the democraticparty and fight fascism and Hitler, or succumb to fascism.” Think your friends would be interested?

"15 Jan, 2021","US media continues to try to link Trump to Kremlin, but in reality American Republicans have more in common with Putin s opponents","American elites don’t understand that Russian ‘liberals’ are more similar to Republicans than Democrats. What’s more, Joe Biden, and other US centre-leftists, are politically closer to Vladimir Putin than the Moscow opposition. ByPaul Robinson, a professor at the University of Ottawa. He writes about Russian and Soviet history, military history, and military ethics, and is author of theIrrussianalityblog As the American House of Representatives completes impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, efforts continue apace to blame the divisions in American society on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Speaking to the press a day after a mob seized the Capitol building in Washington, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, launched into a bizarre and rather ungrammatical rant, proving in the process that conspiracy theories are far from the unique preserve of the American right. Talking of the previous day’s events she remarked that“the message it sent to the world, a complete tool of Putin, this President is. Putin’s goal was to diminish the role of – the view of democracy in the world. That’s what he has been about. And, again, his enabler in this has been Donald Trump for a long time. That’s why I said in that photo when I’m leaving his meeting, ‘With you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.’” As if taking their cue from Pelosi, commentators have since been working hard to link events in the American capital with Russia and Putin. Lacking firm evidence for this, their claims have become increasingly outlandish. Take for example an article by Natasha Bertrand published on Tuesday in the online magazine Politico. This focused on a Russian by the name of Andrey Illarionov, who served as an economic adviser to Vladimir Putin in the early 2000s. According to the article, Illarionov, long a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute in the US, has left the organisation after publishing a blog post defending the Washington rioters. As Ms. Bertrand writes, Illarionov argued that“the storming of the capitol was a ‘trap’ set by police following deliberate ‘provocation’ by blacklivesmatter activists and Democrats. He also amplified unfounded claims about Antifa infiltrating the protests, claimed it is ‘still unknown’ who won the 2020 presidential election, accused the leadership of the democraticparty of ‘seeking to establish its monopoly dominance in the country,’ and wrote that rioters were ‘definitely not’ violating the US Constitution when they broke into the building.’” One might wonder why it matters what some long-retired Russian official thinks. But that would be missing the point. He’s Russian!!! He’s linked to Putin! As Bertrand continues,“Some analysts have raised concerns that Illarionov’s comments are legitimized by virtue of his affiliation with the think tank, and again raise the specter of Russian attempts to sow chaos and doubt in the legitimacy of US elections. “Ilya Zaslavskiy, a researcher now leading a project on post-Soviet kleptocracy called Illarionov’s posts ‘downright dangerous,’ noting that they are shared widely within Russia and among Russian-American Trump supporters.” In other words, we are supposed to believe that Illarionov is acting on Putin’s behalf to“sow chaos”in the United States. His blog post is further proof, if any were required, of the Kremlin’s evil designs. Except for one thing: Illarionov is no friend of Vladimir Putin. In 2005, he quit the Russian government, complaining of what he called its authoritarian turn. Since then, he has stood quite clearly in the ranks of the“non-systemic”opposition, and on taking up his position at the Cato Institute in 2009 was described by the state-run Voice of America as“one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critics.” Nothing Illarionov says or writes could therefore be said to represent the position of the Russian government. The idea that his blog post indicates that the Russian state is trying to‘sow chaos’in the United States is beyond laughable. Anybody with even the slightest knowledge of Russian politics would have known this. How, then, does such obvious ‘fake news’ about Russia keep appearing in the American media? There are really only two options – extraordinary ignorance about all things Russian; or a willful lack of concern for the truth. It is hard to say which is better. Beyond that, though, the Politico article does reveal something rather interesting about Russian liberals, a category in which Illarionov would certainly belong. And in the process, it also indicates a lack of understanding of how Russian liberals differ from their American counterparts. The word ‘liberalism’ has many meanings. In its original form, classical liberalism, it was associated with a limited state, individual rights, and a system of law in which everyone was treated equally. In modern America, its meaning has undergone something of a reversal. To be ‘liberal’ now means to favor big government, identity politics, and group rights, and to support what philosopher Charles Taylor has called“the politics of difference.” This modern form of liberalism has found little traction among Russian liberals, whose foundational period was the late 1980s and early 1990s when classical liberalism, in its modern neoliberal form, held sway. Illarionov, for instance, played a role in persuading Putin to adopt a low 13 percent flat-rate income tax, an archetypal neoliberal economic policy. For such classical/neo-liberals, economic freedom and individual rights are key. Big government, group rights, and identity politics are something to be fought. In other words, Russian liberals and American liberals are not natural friends. It’s hardly surprising, therefore, to see Illarionov coming out in favor of Trump and attacking blacklivesmatter . It’s very much in keeping with how Russian liberals think. As an article in Foreign Policy magazine pointed out earlier this year, while the Russian government has expressed some sympathy for the anti-racism movement in the US, Russian liberals haven’t. On the contrary, they have tended to be rather hostile toward it. Liberal journalist Yulia Latynina, for instance, denounced the riots last summer which followed the killing of George Floyd as“pogroms,”and complained that the rioters were destroying private property. Meanwhile, another liberal journalist, Oleg Kashin, tweeted an image with the caption“Martin Looter King,”and one-time presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak was fired as brand ambassador for the German carmaker Audi“after posting a racist tirade on Instagram describing Black Americans as stupid and lazy.” Illarionov, in other words, is not alone. In many ways, Russian liberals have much more in common with the American republicanparty than with the democraticparty . As the Democrats prepare to take power, instead of lazily shouting ‘Putin, Putin, Putin!’ whenever the word ‘Russia’ pops up, that’s something that they might want to bear in mind.

"15 Jan, 2021",Feds charge ANARCHIST who appeared on CNN after telling Capitol rioters to ‘burn this s**t down’,"The Utah activist who captured the fatal shooting of a woman by Capitol Police during the unrest on video, and told CNN and ABC about it, also instigated the destruction inside, federal charges against him say. According to theaffidavitseeking his arrest, filed in the federal court in Washington, DC, John Earle Sullivan didn’t just film last Wednesday’s storming of the US Capitol – he actually took part in the violence and egged on the destruction that led to the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt. According to the FBI, anarchist John Sullivan told police officers to stand down in the Speaker s Lobby, then agitated the crowd to attack the doors and windows while he filmed. Moments later Ashley Babbitt was shot and killed.https://t.co/4dsh8ivgka Democrats accused President Donald Trump of inciting an“insurrection”after a crowd of presumably his supporters broke into the Capitol during the joint session of Congress that was meeting to certify Joe Biden as the next US president. Babbitt was among the five people – including two Capitol Police officers – whose deaths were linked to the unrest. “Go! Go! Get this s**t!”Sullivan says in the video he turned over to the FBI, as the crowd is breaking through the door inside the Capitol, according to the affidavit. Babbitt is shot shortly thereafter as she attempts to enter through the breach. At other times he yells“Let’s go. This s**t is ours! F**k yeah,”and“Let’s burn this s**t down.” Hey@jaketapperI got a big scoop for you.pic.twitter.com/XlqMN8jNo5 He told a different story to CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Good Morning America the evening and morning after, presenting himself as a left-wing activist who just came to document the protest. “I can t tell you that I agree with Trump or MAGA supporters,""Sullivan told Salt Lake City’s KSTU-TVlast Friday.“I can tell you I don t.”He did insist that his footage showed Trump supporters storming the Capitol, not Antifa as some claimed. Officially, Sullivan is a“civil rights activist”who runs Insurgence USA, an organization established in June 2020 amid the protests over the death of George Floyd. They say they“want to build local powers to enable the community to intervene in violence enacted by the state and government vigilantes,”rhetoric commonly used by blacklivesmatter and affiliated groups. John Sullivan faced charges here in Utah after organizing protests.

A journalist with Provo’s KUTV news looked at the hashtags Sullivan has used on social media and they included both # blacklivesmatter and #antifa, as well as #abolishthepolice. Later in the summer, he delivered an expletive-laden speech at a protest in Washington, DC threatening to “rip Trump out of the White House,” chanting""It’s time for a revolution”and threatening to“burn this s**t down.” blacklivesmatter inc. threatening to “rip the president out of the White House” They say they won’t wait until the next election.They’re openly calling for a revolution.This is domestic terrorism on full display, out in the open.

Activist communities around the country have“banished”Sullivan and consider him“a dangerous provocateur,”Blumenthal said onTwitter, citing the DC-based Black House News. Yet he was welcomed on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show, which“falsely”called him a left-wing activist and didn’t ask why he was at the Capitol. The night of the Capitol riot, Sullivan was welcomed on@andersoncooperto present himself as the heroic journalist who recorded Babbit s shooting. Cooper falsely called him a ""left-wing activist"" and didn t ask why he was actually in the Capitol. This was fodder for the Right.pic.twitter.com/LPezi5Hv09 Sullivan“is not blacklivesmatter or Antifa, and is out to wreck their cause,”Blumenthalwrote. OAN reporter Jack Posobiec noted that Sullivan had posted on Instagram about his contacts with the FBI. That doesn’t necessarily mean much, however, given the rush by many Democrats to report Trump supporters to federal authorities in the aftermath of the January 6 events. Anarchist John Sullivan was boasting on Instagram of his contacts with the FBI yesterday. Today they arrested him for rioting.pic.twitter.com/45YkbBWP7r Whoever Sullivan is actually working for may or may not be revealed at his trial.

"14 Jan, 2021","Nike to deny donations to Trump-backing republicanparty lawmakers, jumping on latest corporate virtue-signaling bandwagon","Nike just did it and joined numerous other corporate behemoths withholding support for Republican lawmakers who challenged the outcome of the presidential election and allegedly threatened US democracy by doing so. The sportswear giant announced on Wednesday that its political action committee (PAC) will no longer donate to any member of the US Congress, who fails to uphold the“principles of democracy”, including the 147 Republican legislators, who“voted to decertify the Electoral College results.” Nike joins other companies that have cut off donations to members of Congress who voted to decertify the Electoral College results. Statement:pic.twitter.com/6xT2HlXNIr Nike is somewhat of a latecomer to the latest corporate trend in the US: signaling a love of democracy by keeping money away from Republican pockets. The likes of Commerce Bank, Mastercard, Marriott, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and AT&T have already slapped the same group of lawmakers with their versions of unilateral sanctions. Greeting cards giant Hallmark went as far as to demand that Senators Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall returned their donations. The statement didn’t specify that those amounted to about $3,000 and $5,000 respectively in the 2019-2020 election cycle. Others, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have paused all political donations either for review or indefinitely, according to their statements. Whether such pledges hold in three or six or 12 months is anyone’s guess. Corporations are not particularly famous for being idealism-driven organizations, despite all mission statements to the contrary, and tend to put their share prices ahead of the less tangible values. Great to see Nike take a principled stand by withholding donations to politicians.Now they can keep more of the money they make from slave labor their factories use in a country holding two million ethnic/religious minorities and committing cultural genocide. Good for them! It’s safe to assume that if and when the national outrage over the storming of US Capitol building by Trump supporters runs its course in the media, corporate donors will be back to the usual game: playing both sides. Nike, for example, was happy todonateto the republicanparty far more than to Dems even as Colin Kaepernick was the face of its ads. It was in 2018, two years before blacklivesmatter protests went mainstream, so the company milked some extra publicity from all thestoriesabout people burning their sneakers to protest its pick of the knee-bending NFL quarterback. And even if the anger perseveres and publicly donating to Republican candidates is still perceived as a liability, it’s not like America Inc. is renouncing the right to exercise free speech through unlimited opaque super-PAC donations.Thosevehicles for influencing US political life outstrippedregularPACs by an order of magnitude in the last election cycle ($3.2 billion vs. $529.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics) and are there to stay, no matter who invades the Capitol. We talk so casually about how corporations are ending their political donations to the republicanparty . The fact that politicians are purchased is just accepted.Corporations aren t people. Their political donations aren t ""free speech."" The Citizens United case should be reversed.#Capitol Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Jan, 2021",CNN’s Cuomo rages as his own words supporting blacklivesmatter riots come back to bite him,"Confronted over his condemnation of last week’s riot at the US Capitol, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has struggled to excuse his seemingly hypocritical endorsement of less-than-peaceful protest tactics by blacklivesmatter in June. A little over six months ago, Cuomo savaged commentators who dared voice their disapproval for the large-scale property destruction and physical attacks perpetrated by groups of blacklivesmatter rioters.“Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful”in the Constitution, the news anchor sneered on air. After last week’s unrest at the Capitol, however, Cuomo – the younger brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo – explicitly condemned the unruly pro-Trump demonstration, calling out“those who stoked these flames”for“feeding lies”and“moving people”to violence. ""Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful."" — Fredo CuomoRemember last summer when CNN was using MLK’s quote, “A riot is the language of the unheard” out of context in order to add fuel to the fire? I do. These people have no shame.pic.twitter.com/30FxXJOS2C When social media users attempted to remind Cuomo that he had endorsed the very same behavior quite recently, he only got angrier, insisting that the rioters were“acting on the animus put out by you fringe agitators.” “Shame on you,”he tweeted in response to commenters stating he and his ideological compatriots“have no shame.” This is more sedition than speech. And it is on you. These people are acting on the animus put out by you fringe agitators. This is where demonizing and deception gets you. Even now, you spare trump and try to divide. Shame on you.https://t.co/MtYAmK9L20 “Too many see the protests as the problem. No, the problem is what forced your fellow citizens to take to the streets – persistent and poisonous inequities and injustice,”Cuomo lamented in June, unaware he would be eating those same words just a few months later. Plenty of viewers called him (and his employer) out for playing political favorites with rioters. What he meant to say was, burning, looting and rioting are A-OK ... if I agree with your politics. Hey CNN how can a reporter have all of Minneapolis burning behind him and it’s mostly peaceful. And Republicans kick down the door or two and it’s the worst thing in the world. I’m not condoning it at all i’m just saying you are stupid poopy heads.#ramenking But Cuomo just couldn’t leave well enough alone, resuming grandstanding over the Capitol riot on Tuesday in an apparent effort to justify his hypocrisy. So dont.https://t.co/qXHCpJFs1j This is a lie. And I hope whoever claims you as friend or family sees the bullshit you are putting out.https://t.co/uAf5cJMbms Social media users wouldn’t let him off the hook, quickly getting under his skin with the use of his hated nickname“Fredo,”a reference to the ‘stupid brother’ from the Godfather films. This isn t even a very good attempt at backtracking. You got destroyed by a dude munching on dry ramen over this.https://t.co/tSUzrAPlQt Nice ratio, Fredo .... Many of the biggest cheerleaders for the destructive and violent blacklivesmatter protests over the summer have become the most vocal critics of last week’s pro-Trump uprising, though in terms of both lives lost and property damage it scarcely holds a candle to the weeks of fiery riots that the media establishment excused as“mostly peaceful.” Think your friends would be interested?

"12 Jan, 2021",PBS lawyer fired after championing ‘REEDUCATION CAMPS’ for children of Trump supporters in latest Project Veritas sting,"Hidden camera footage of PBS exec Michael Beller, in which he appears to wax poetic about ‘deprogramming’ Trump supporters’ kids and celebrates their parents’ death from Covid-19, has apparently gotten him fired. Speaking to an undercover reporter for conservative muckraking outfit Project Veritas, Beller appeared to boast that “even if [president-elect Joe] Biden wins, we go for all the Republican voters, and Homeland Security will take their children away.” Does@PBScondone Principal Counsel Michael Beller’s radical agenda of political violence?#ExposePBSpic.twitter.com/W3R9XUCmlO “We ll put them into re-education camps,” he continued, suggesting this was necessary because “kids who are growing up knowing nothing but Trump” would take after their Trump-supporting parents and presumably become pint-sized bigots. They’ll be raising a generation of intolerant, horrible people -–horrible kids. PBS responded via Twitter just hours after Project Veritas’ clip was posted, announcing that Beller - who had served as principal counsel of business affairs for PBS since 2013, according to his LinkedIn page – “no longer works for” the publicly-funded network. It even belittled his former role, calling him a “mid-level staff attorney” and insisting he did not make “any editorial decisions.” The network stated they “strongly condemn[ed] violence.” “There is no place for hateful rhetoric at PBS, and this individual’s views in no way reflect our values or opinions.” (2/3) Beller seemed less than serious in some parts of the recording, grinning, for example, as he suggested Biden supporters should “go to the White House and throw molotov cocktails” should the Democrat lose the election. While the summer s blacklivesmatter protests featured plenty of the homemade projectiles, few of Beller s class demographic were actually doing the throwing. However, the lawyer seemed to have put quite a bit of thought into how to reeducate Trump supporters kids, expanding on the ""enlightenment camps"" where they d be sent as he spoke to his undercover companion. ""They re nice! They have Sesame Street characters in the classrooms and they watch PBS all day."" The children s program has been repeatedly skewered by conservative pundits for indoctrinating the younger generation, most recently with a half-hour ""anti-racist"" special called ""The Power of We."" Beller also sounded genuinely delighted when discussing a surge of Covid-19 cases in middle America and venting his spleen on ""stupid"" Americans living outside cities like Washington DC. ""What s great is that Covid is spiking in all the red states right now,"" he said, explaining that ""either those people won t come out to vote for Trump…or a lot of them are sick and dying."" While Beller echoed most of his establishment media compatriots in describing Trump as ""close to Hitler,"" his views on certain competitors were less than charitable. ""CNN doesn t have real news anymore,"" he complained, observing ""It s just talking heads talking about Trump all day long."" Fox News was even less tolerable, though - the PBS exec said it ""makes [him] want to throw up after five minutes."" Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Jan, 2021",A revolution will NEVER AGAIN happen in the US: Today’s demonstrators have no real goals beyond snapping that protest selfie,"A revolution needs two elements to succeed: ‘people power’ conspicuously disrupting normal life, and demands that differ from the current regime’s. Without those, it’s a theatrical, easily hijacked mob: see the US since 2001. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram While the US was founded in a revolution, somewhere along the way its inhabitants forgot how to successfully stage one – and, in the process, became easy prey for those in need of cannon fodder for their own battles. Certainly, there were large and successful public movements during the 20th century – the civil rights struggle, the anti-war movement, women’s suffrage, and so on – but at some point, the ruling class became accustomed to the tried-and-true tactics of marching with signs, shouting slogans, and even blocking traffic. As the powers-that-be became more accustomed to seeing large numbers of people turn out to call them nasty (if well-deserved) names and taunt them with clever rhymes, the utility of demonstrations – no matter how massive – all but disappeared. A thoroughly domesticated media establishment can opt not to cover even the largest protest or rally, or misreport its numbers – and the gatherings themselves run the risk of being co-opted by whomever has the loudest voice. This became abundantly clear during last year’s blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protests, in which some groups remained entirely peaceful while others, incited by a relatively small faction of demonstrators, tore up their cities and set them on fire. Fewer and fewer Americans have the time or the inclination to understand complex political issues. Taking interest in ‘causes’ has become more of a trend than a commitment, and these shallow ‘movements’ travel around the world just like a fashion trend would, aided by subtle ‘nudges’ from the media. CNN covers ruling-class-approved political ‘uprisings’ such as a parade or a fashion show – so much so, in fact, that their coverage of last year’s riots in Hong Kong actually included ahandy ‘what-to-wear’ guidefor wannabe activists and fawning over the rioters’makeshift weapons. Back home, they gushed about the “mostly peaceful” blacklivesmatter demonstrations while fires literally raged in the background. Frustrated Americans with a vague, nagging sense that something is wrong with society are quick to resonate with the protest behavior they see on the screen and the inspiring (if not necessarily true) stories that accompany it. Taking to the street armed with a sign and a list of well-worn slogans becomes a political rite of passage, a quasi-religious affirmation that one is Doing Something™ to make the world a better place. Once in the middle of a crowd crackling with potential energy, the individual is no longer thinking as an individual – except maybe to take that crucial protest selfie. Pics or it didn’t happen! Protesting for show isn’t the only element wet-behind-the-ears American slacktivists share with the US-backed color revolutionaries abroad. The leaders of carefully choreographed uprisings ‘over there’ target disenfranchised groups or ethnic minorities with scientific precision, sometimes even helping them with their cause before revealing to each group that their problems have all been caused by the governing body itself. These disparate factions, their trust gained by a few table scraps thrown their way, are then deployed as the manipulators’ revolutionary army while the manipulators themselves hide safely in their bunkers. Similarly, in the US, the box-checking “trained Marxist” figureheads of blacklivesmatter flood their message of hope and justice into poor black and minority communities, encouraging the residents to blame all their problems on systemic racism. These jet-setting professionals promise the moon and ask ‘only’ for the right to serve as the mouthpiece of the black community (as if there could be one monolithic ‘black community’) in return. The rise of ‘intersectionality’ and competitive victimhood in the US and Western Europe have turned ethnic and religious factions that might normally be allies against one another, conning the downtrodden into picking fights with the people one rung up on the ladder while being blissfully unaware of their real enemies at the top. Only when those factions have been worked into a revolutionary lather are the full extent of the ruling group’s demands unveiled. While these tend to bear little resemblance to the issues the ‘movement’ initially used to lure the disenfranchised into its ranks, it’s too late to back out by that point. The communities blacklivesmatter has grown fat leeching off are still poor, desperate, and abused by police, except now there are more cameras filming the abuse, and another stream of income pouring – according to some activists, at least – straight into the democraticparty . Perhaps this is why many of the blacklivesmatter marches in American cities were so overwhelmingly white, joining up for that protest selfie and the ever-present need to boost their activist credibility. Even when they took over entire city blocks, as in the infamous Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone encampment in Seattle, there was no ‘next step’ in their plan, and their cosplay revolutionary zeal quickly evaporated. This is hardly a left/right phenomenon, either. When pro-Trump protesters were all but invited in to the Capitol last week, many didn’t stay for long, and not only because the authorities had showed up. After taking that protest selfie with your feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s death, what more is there to do? Confronting actual congressmen? That sounds like work. There are a lot of justifiably angry people in the US right now – people who’ve been told that even admitting to their rage is wrong. But suppressing it by latching on to a series of shiny prefab ‘causes’ won’t make it go away, and nor will protesting for the cameras. A real revolution takes work – and that’s why it’ll never happen in the US again. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Jan, 2021",Are you ready for total (ideological) war?,"So, welcome to 2021! If last week was any indication, it is going to be quite an exciting year. ByC.J. Hopkins, award-winning American playwright, novelist and political satirist based in Berlin. His dystopian novel, Zone 23 is published by Snoggsworthy, Swaine & Cormorant. His essays and other works can be found at, and he can be reached via,cjhopkins.comorconsentfactory.org. This article was originally published byConsent Factory. It is going to be the year in which GloboCap reminds everyone who is actually in charge and restores“normality”throughout the world, or at least attempts to restore“normality,”or the“New Normality,”or the“Great Normal Reset,”or“The New Normal War on Domestic Terror”… or whatever they eventually decide to call it. In any event, whatever they call it, GloboCap is done playing grab-ass. They have had it with all this“populism”malarkey that has been going on for the last four years. Yes, that’s right, the party is over, you Russian-backed white supremacist terrorists! You Trump-loving, anti-mask grandmother killers! You anti-vax, election-fraud-conspiracy theorists! You deviants who refuse to follow orders, wear your damn masks, vote for who they tell you, and believe whatever completely nonsensical official propaganda they pour into your heads! Oh, yes, you really did it this time! You stormed the goddamned US Capitol. You and your racist, Russia-backed army ofbison-hat-wearing, half-naked actors have meddled with the primal forces of GloboCap, and now, by God, you will atone! No, do not try to minimize your crimes. You entered a building without permission! The building where America simulates democracy! You walked around in there, waving silly flags! You went into the chamber, into people’s offices! One of you actually put your filthy populist feet up on Pelosi’sdesk… ON HER DESK! This aggression will not stand! OK, before I go any further with this essay, I need to explain to my regular readers (in case it wasn’t already clear) that I’ve decided to forswear every word I’ve ever written, and all my principles, and my common sense, and join the remainder of my old leftist and liberal friends in the orgy of online hate and outrage they are currently mindlessly indulging in. Yes, I realize this comes as a shock, but I have seen the GloboCap writing on the wall, and I don’t want to… you know, get ideologically“cleansed,”or charged with“extremism,”or“insurrectionism,”or“domestic terrorism,”or“populism,”or whatever. I’m already in enough trouble as it is for not playing ball with their“apocalyptic plague,”and whatever else I am, I am certainly no martyr, and I have a career in the arts to consider, so I have decided to listen to my inner coward and join the goose-stepping global-capitalist mob, which is why this column sounds slightly out of character. See, back in the old days, before my conversion, I would have made fun of my liberal friends for calling this“storming”of the Capitol a“coup,”or an“insurrection,”and for demanding that the protesters be prosecuted as“domestic terrorists.”I probably would have scolded them a bit for taking to the internet and spewing their hatred at the unarmed womanshotdead by the police like a pack of soulless, totalitarian jackals. I might have even made a reference to that infamous scene in Schindler’s List where the crowd of“normal”German citizens all laugh and jeer as the Jews are marched away to the ghetto by the Nazi goons. But, now that I have seen the light, I see how bad and wrong that would have been. Clearly, trespassing in the US Capitol is a crime that should be punishable by death. And comparing contemporary American liberals to the “good Germans” during the Nazi era is so outrageous that… well, it should probably be censored. So, good thing I decided not to do that! Plus, the woman was a“devoted conspiracy theorist,”so she got what she deserved, right? (“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes”was the official liberal shibboleth, I believe.) In fact (and I hope my liberal friends are still reading this), the police should have shot the entire lot of them! All these Russian-backed Nazi insurrectionists should have been gunned down right there on the spot, preferably by muscle-bound corporate mercenaries and CIA snipers in Black Hawk helicopters with big Facebook and Twitter logos on them! Actually, anyone who trespassed in the Capitol Building (which is like a cathedral), or just came to the protest wearing a MAGA hat, should be hunted down by federal authorities, charged as a“domestic white-supremacist terrorist,”frog-marched out onto blacklivesmatter Plaza, and shot, in the face, live, on TV, so that everyone can watch and howl at their screens like theTwo Minutes Hatein1984. That would teach these“insurrectionists”a lesson! Or they could shoot them in one of those corporate-branded stadiums! We could make it a weekly televised event. It’s not like there is any shortage of Trump-supporting“domestic terrorists.”They could use a different stadium every week, deck the place out with big“New Normal”banners, play music, make speeches, the whole nine yards. Everyone would have to wear masks, of course, and strictly adhere to social distancing. Folks could bring the kids, make a day of it. How am I doing so far, leftist and liberal friends? No? Not fanatical and hateful enough? OK, so what is it going to take to convince you that I have changed my tune, got my mind right, and am totally on board with the New Normal totalitarianism? Trump? Sure, I can do Trump. I hate him! He’s Hitler! He’s Russian Hitler! He’s Russian white supremacist Hitler! Yes, I know I’ve spent the last four years pointing out that he isn’t actually Hitler, or a Russian agent, and that he’s really just the same ridiculous, narcissistic ass clown that he has always been, but I was wrong. He’s definitely Hitler, and a Russian agent! He is certainly not just a pathetic old huckster without a single powerful ally in Washington who could not stage an actual coup if Putin nuked every blue state on the map. No, I soil myself in fear before his awesome power. Never mind that he’s just been banned byFacebook,Twitter, and numerous other corporateplatforms, and made a fool of by the corporate media, the international political establishment, the intelligence agencies, and the rest of GloboCap since the day he took the oath of office. Forget the fact that, although he holds the nuclear launch codes in his tiny little hands and is commander in chief of the US military, the most he could do to challenge his removal was file a buttload of hopeless lawsuits and sit around in the Oval Office eating cheeseburgers and tweeting into the night. No, none of that means a thing, not when he still has the power to“embolden”a few dozen pissed-off Americans to storm (or calmlywalk) into the Capitol and take selfies sitting in the vice president’s chair! Look, the point is, I hate him. And I hate his supporters. I hate everyone who doesn’t hate him and his supporters. I hate everyone who won’t wear a mask. I hate the Republicans. I hate the Russians. I hate everyone who won’t get the vaccine. My God do I hate them! I am so full of hatred and mindless rage that it is making me crazy. I am so consumed with self-righteous hatred, propaganda, and manufactured hysteria that, if Rachel Maddow, or Chris Hayes, or whoever, told me that it was time to round them all up, these“domestic terrorists,”these“insurrectionists,”these“conspiracy theorists,”these“anti-mask extremists”(and anyone else who won’t obey us), and put them on trains and send them to camps, I’d probably be OK with that. How am I doing, liberals? Am I back in the club? Because, I get it. I swear! I’m cured! Praise God! I’m ready to pitch in and do my part. I believe in GloboCap’s final victory! I’m willing to work, if our leaders order me, 10, 12, or 14 hours a day, and give all I have for GloboCap victory! I am ready for total ideological war… an ideological war more total and radical than anything I can even imagine! Sure, our imaginary enemies are formidable (and this war will probably last forever… or at least until the end of global capitalism), but, in the words of one our greatest liberal heroes, George W. Bush,“bring it on!” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"11 Jan, 2021",Arnold Schwarzenegger’s nonsensical likening of Capitol riot to Kristallnacht is a haunting pretext for dehumanizing Trump voters,"It s disgusting enough when a manipulator diminishes the horrors of the Holocaust by disingenuously invoking the Nazis to demonize a political enemy. It s downright nauseating when the invoker is a morally bankrupt Hitler admirer. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. Enter stage far-left, Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former Governor of California -- who said""I don t remember""when he was confronted in 2003 with an old interview transcript noting his admiration for the Fuhrer -- is winning plaudits on social media for posting a viral Twitter video on Sunday that absurdly compared 1938 s Kristallnacht to last Wednesday s US Capitol riot. The Austrian-born actor s attempt at likening the Night of Broken Glass to the day when windows were broken at the Capitol was stupid, sure, but it was also devious. With dramatic music playing in the background and a propagandist s confident stare straight into the camera, Schwarzenegger leaped from defaming the Proud Boys -- calling them the equivalent of the Brownshirts who terrorized German Jews on Kristallnacht -- to condemning President Donald Trump and his""enablers""as coup engineers. He framed his tale as a warning from someone who grew up in the ashes of Adolf Hitler s fallen reich. He spoke of how his father and the other former Nazi Party members on the block took out their emotional pain and guilt by getting drunk and abusing their wives and children. The messaging is clear: This is what can happen when a nation loses its democracy, when people are misled and, little by little, go along with an evil leader s lies and intolerance. It goes without saying who is cast this time as the guy with the strange mustache. ""President Trump sought to overturn the results of an election, and of a fair election,""the script reads.""He sought a coup by misleading people with lies. My father and our neighbors were misled also with lies, and I know where such lies lead."" The crowd ate it up. The video had nearly 34 million views by Monday afternoon, and the reviews were glowing. Actress Alice Evans called the video""among the top 10 speeches I ve ever heard.""Journalist and author David Cay Johnston praised the message as""smart insights from someone who understands that Donald is a clear and present danger to our liberty.""Actor Tommy Chong lamented that foreign-born Schwarzenegger isn t eligible to run for president:""What an intelligent president he would have made."" This must be among the top ten speeches I ve ever heard. It s hit me viscerally. I feel hope. I feel like - I want to be a better person. ❤️ Smart insights from someone who understands that Donald is a clear and present danger to our liberty. Imagine if Arnold was born in America, and what an intelligent president he would have made.https://t.co/wIEgtc9Lt0 On the contrary, Schwarzenegger is more like a symbol of the pop-culture stupefying of America, from his acting to his politics. Comparing the Capitol riot, born out of an election-fraud protest, to Kristallnacht -- when synagogues and Jewish businesses were destroyed in a direct precursor to the Holocaust – is next-level ignorance. The fact that so many people bought it says a lot about where we are. But it s not surprising in a country where millions of people were trained to believe Trump is a Nazi because he threatened to govern the US in the interests of American citizens. They see him as a dangerous dictator, even though he s the one being censored, and the deceivers who propagandized against him get book deals and bigger audiences than they ever deserved. It s only fitting that the moralizer who s telling anti-Trump Americans what they want to hear today is someone who has no business lecturing anyone. He groped and humiliated women in Hollywood for decades, which headmittedin 2018 after lying about it on the campaign trail in 2003. His marriage to Maria Shriver essentially ended in 2011, after it came to light Schwarzenegger had anaffair– and a child – with his housemaid. And at least two black bodybuilders have accused the former Mr. Olympia ofracist abuse. It also seems Arnie had something of a soft spot for Adolf in the past. Schwarzenegger was quoted in a 1975 interview saying,""I admired Hitler, for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education, up to power. I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for what he did with it."" But all of that will be forgotten today. Schwarzenegger, who made no such video when blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioters were burning America s cities and breaking glass last summer, is a hero again. He ripped the Bad Orange Man. And he s chiming in at just the right time in a push to inflict retribution on Trump s supporters. ""What are we to make of those elected officials who have enabled his lies and his treachery?""Schwarzenegger asked. He added:""John F. Kennedy wrote a book called Profiles in Courage. A number of members of my own party, because of their own spinelessness, would never see their names in such a book. I guarantee you. They re complicit with those who carried the flag of self-righteous insurrection into the Capitol."" All over America, people are being investigated and, in some cases, fired on suspicion that they attended last week s pro-Trump protest in Washington. Those who support Trump are guilty by association. Businesses are being warned not to hire people who worked for Trump. The cancel mobs won t have it. “Let it be known to the business world: Hire any of Trump’s (Press Secretaries) fellow fabulists-and Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie.” -‘Why We’re Holding Those Who Lied For Trump Accountable’https://t.co/oFMo9RP6yK People are making blacklists, millions of Americans are being dehumanized, and their woes are being celebrated.

"11 Jan, 2021","Can America be saved? It would have to start with some TRUTH-TELLING and unselfishness, so…not so much","For those who hadn t noticed the obvious, the January 6 “insurrection” at the Capitol verified that America is at war with itself – long divorced from its principles of government “of the people, by the people and for the people.” ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. Ironically, it was during the last civil war when President Abraham Lincoln spoke those eloquent words at Gettysburg, asserting that the honored dead had fallen in battle so America could have a“new birth of freedom”and govern with such dedication to the will of its people that it“shall not perish from the earth.” There are no Abraham Lincolns today. There are no statesmen. There is no one who sees any kind of picture bigger than a selfie. And eloquence? The new figurehead can t even tell his lies in coherent sentences or keep his hands to himself. There are selfish grifters who govern entirely on a me-first-me-last basis, seeing only their agendas and opportunities to seize more power. There are billionaires and foreign or otherwise special interests that buy and sell the egomaniacal hucksters. There are basement dwellers who burn, loot and brutalize to fight for disingenuous, racist causes. There are people in horned hats or tactical gear who break into the Capitol to sit at Nancy Pelosi s desk or take souvenirs. At this moment of crisis, we get the usual crass opportunism. President-elect Joe Biden – the guy who vowed to heal and unify – essentially blames the failure of police to defend the Capitol on racism. These are the same police who have protected him for nearly five decades. But Biden and other Democrats can t resist the chance to falsely slash at and exploit America s Achilles heel, the race weapon. Mainstream media outlets suddenly learn how to use words such as“riot”and“domestic terrorism,”and discover that violent protests aren t noble. They forget the talking points of last summer, when blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioterstorchedAmerica s cities on false pretenses. They even help lead the effort to hunt down the perpetrators and destroy their lives. They and their social media partners work in unison to further silence non-conforming voices and brand them as dangerous villains. No longer do the propagandists quote Martin Luther King, saying that“a riot is the language of the unheard.”That s because this time, the quote applies accurately. People fed up with being betrayed, lied to and falsely demonized have such little remaining hope in the system that pushing through a line of police at the Capitol can seem like a good idea. Many of these unheard manifested previously as theTea Party, which sprung up in 2009 to fight overreaching government, deficit spending and open borders. The response was predictable: lies. Brand the movement as being about, what else? Racism. Falsely accuse, then say it over and over and over again until the zombie armies believe it. Never, ever, ever listen to – let alone heed – the demands of the people. Keep the fake wars going. Keep the boot of illegal immigration on the throats of wage earners. Keep the government growing. Keep globalist interests on the front burner. If necessary, distract with some fake issues, liketransgender restroomsand Koran burning. Deflected, belittled and falsified, the people were so unheard by 2016 that they elected a reality show star. Most weren t foolish enough to think that he was a righteous man, but they saw him punch back at the so-called elites and stand up to manipulators in the media. More than anything, they were convinced that, unlike the Democrat and Republican rulers and media mouthpieces, Donald Trump didn t hate them. In fact, he showed love for them and vowed to govern in America in the best interests of its citizens. The usual tactics were deployed – have we mentioned skin color? – but the people were so excited at the prospect of having a president who s at least a little bit on their side that they revolted. No media-pollster CONfidence game could keep them away from voting to Make America Great Again. They stood by Trump through the ups and downs and self-inflicted wounds of his presidency. Wave after wave of largely deceptive attacks failed to move them. Being called bigots, Russian agents and cultists didn t scare them away. And when Trump alleged that his re-election was stolen through massive fraud, they rallied to “stop the steal.” With those allegations dismissed by the courts mostly on procedural grounds – and any evidence supporting themquashed by the media and Big Techwithout being seriously investigated – the people are so angry and unheard in 2021 that we have a powder keg. The only way to diffuse it would be to start telling some truths and have a real reckoning with disenfranchised, working-class Americans. Auditing the election would be a good starting point. Biden himself should call for it. Tens of millions of people believe the result to be fraudulent. That alone is a crisis big enough to merit a real and independent investigation. If the allegations are as baseless and absurd as the media says, Biden has nothing to lose. He can build credibility and restore confidence in the nation s political system by taking the magnanimous route and demanding a true accounting of the votes. That s not where we re going. As in a Banana Republic, the ruling party is now seeking to prosecute its defeated political enemy while dehumanizing and destroying his supporters. With nine days left until Biden takes office, the corporatist-globalist establishment will race to impeach Trump again, and surely, he will need to be prosecuted for other alleged crimes after leaving office. His supporters also must be ruined to never rise again. The sins of individual wrongdoers will be overstated, such as when incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer likens the Capitol breach to Japan s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Those sins also will be applied to the whole populist-constitutionalist movement. The phrase“mostly peaceful”is forgotten. Corporations and governments are in the process of a witch hunt to fire those who are found to have participated in the protests, including those who merely demonstrated legally. Cancel mobs will seek to out them and destroy their lives. The absurd Pearl Harbor comparison illustrates the ruling class’ visceral hatred of flyover-country Americans. Former CIA internAnderson Cooper, the Vanderbilt heir and CNN host, revealed that hatred further, looking at footage of the protesters and saying with disgust that they will“go back to the Olive Garden and to the Holiday Inn”and discuss“the great day they had in Washington.” This doesn t end well. Deflecting and defaming people rather than honestly confronting their legitimate grievances has gotten America to this untenable point. The revolt has already escalated from the Tea Party uprising to electing Trump to violent protest. Do the Bidens, Schumers and Coopers of the world – and their backers in finance, Big Tech and arms manufacturing – really think that tens of millions of freedom-demanding Americans are going to curl up and obey because they re being called names again? How s that working out so far? What comes next will be far uglier. America as we know it is over if it remains on this track. The present predicament hearkens back to another Lincoln speech, in which he used a line from the Bible to make his point:“A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Subscribeto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.

"11 Jan, 2021","Melania Trump condemns Capitol Hill violence, but draws hate from liberals for sympathizing with dead rioter","First Lady Melania Trump has denounced the Capitol Hill riot, writing that “violence is never acceptable.” However, Mrs. Trump was blasted for offering sympathy for Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter shot dead by police. With President Donald Trump banned from social media and otherwise silent, the first lady issued astatementon Monday condemning the riot on Capitol Hill last Wednesday, in which a pro-Trump mob forced its way inside the US Capitol to protest Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. “Make no mistake about it, I absolutely condemn the violence that has occurred on our Nation’s Capitol,”she wrote.“Violence is never acceptable.” In a letter riddled with spelling mistakes, Mrs. Trump offered her sympathies to the six people who died during or after the riots, including an off-duty officer who died by apparent suicide on Sunday. However, liberals took issue with Mrs. Trump offering condolences to Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot dead by a Capitol police officer during the riot. The anti-Trump crowd called Babbitt a“domestic terrorist”and an“insurrectionist,”and hammered the first lady for listing Babbitt’s name before the two police officers in her statement. Melania praised Ashli Babbitt by name in her statement — an insurrectionist who tired to overthrow the government. 🙄pic.twitter.com/jPG2jJc5Fs In which Melania Trump says, ""my heart goes out to: Air Force Veteran, Ashli Babbit,...."" a domestic terrorist who was killed by federal law enforcement as she tried to gain entry to the Speaker s Lobby during the invasion of the U.S. Capitol. 😡https://t.co/CKz0vQnbAj Donald Trump first told the insurrectionists “We Love You.”Now, Melania Trump releases a statement praising “Most recently, my heart goes out to: Air Force Veteran, Ashli Babbit.”Babbit was the insurrectionist killed while storming the Capitol to kill members of Congress.😳 Reaction to Babbitt’s death has been extreme, and split along familiar politicalfault lines. Seen by the most fervent Trump supporters as something of a martyr, the 14-year veteran was shown zero sympathy by liberals. Among some of the more extreme comments circulating on Twitter were onecelebratinghow Babbitt is now“feeding the worms,”while numerousparody accountspoking fun at her death are online. Mrs. Trump’s show of respect to Babbitt wasn’t the only issue liberals found in her statement. Five paragraphs in, the first lady moved away from praying for victims’ families to condemning the“salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations”made against her since the riot. What gossip and attacks Mrs. Trump was referring to is unclear, and her critics accused her of using the opportunity to paint“herself as the real victim.” Melania Trump has issued a typo-filled statement painting herself as the real victim of the Capitol attack and lashing out at everyone who reported that she refused to cancel her photo shoot during the attack. Surprised she didn’t throw in a “fuck Christmas” for good measure. In a statement, the First Lady expresses sympathy for slain rioters, as well as slain police officers, in the same sentence. She then spends a paragraph speaking up for another victim: herself.https://t.co/8xBdlrAo4T Though the left raged at Mrs. Trump for equating Babbitt’s death with those of two police officers, most liberals didn’t show the same reverence for the badge last summer. Amid wall-to-wall coverage of ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ riots, few pundits and commentators eulogized David Dorn, an African-American retired police captainshot deadby a rioter in St. Louis, Missouri. With the fallout from Wednesday’s riot continuing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has demanded that Vice President Mike Pence immediately invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office. Should Pence decline, Pelosi has promised to bring articles of impeachment to a vote by Tuesday. Efforts to oust him notwithstanding, Trump will leave office on January 20, when Biden is inaugurated.

"11 Jan, 2021","Welcome to the Big Tech Sweepstakes, where blacklivesmatter looters win corporate prizes, and Capitol Hill rioters get the boot!","Step up ladies and gentlemen, and take a chance to have your movement promoted by the Silicon Valley overlords, who really aren’t in bed with the democraticparty , honest. You can trust us, we’ve fact-checked it for you! Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Hello and thank you for participating in the Big Tech Sweepstakes, where your political movement could win the approval of the mighty corporations that now dominate your lives! Isn’t democracy great? Oh look, we have a contestant! Could you please state your name, sir, and tell us a little bit about yourself? blacklivesmatter : Hi, sure, my name is blacklivesmatter , but my friends call me blacklivesmatter . I am a social justice movement that first appeared in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin. But my real claim to fame came with the nationwide protests that began in May 2020 with the death of George Floyd, a black man, who was killed during an arrest by a racist white cop. And are you certain the cop was a racist? I mean, isn’t it possible the officer was just poorly trained to responsibly carry out his duties? blacklivesmatter : Hello? As I said, he was white. And, as critical race theoryteaches, racism is practically a genetic trait of all white people. Their inherent sense of privilege and superiority, cultivated for a long time without resistance, has led to the oppression of minorities throughout history. This makes all white people complicit in the rise of white supremacy, the scourge of our times. Now it’s our duty to let white folks out of their racist closets, so to speak. I see. That’s very moving and inspirational! Is there anything else that has motivated you to speak out on this momentous issue? blacklivesmatter : Well, as you might imagine, such a movement could never get off the ground without cash, boatloads of it. And with the help of some very generous philanthropy, not least of all from George Soros, I was able to organize a worldwide movement against the systemic racism that is gnawing away at the soul of America. Today, we even have entire sports teams taking the knee during the national anthem, for example, as well as massive corporate sponsorship to protest against racist police. Not a cell phone in sight, just people living in thr moment.pic.twitter.com/Pwm2RZgZXe Well, that is certainly awe-inspiring and very liberal! Okay, just a minute, we have another contestant here. Please, tell us your name and a little bit about yourself. ATV: Hello. My name is Angry Trump Voter (ATV), and, well, I’m furious. Oh dear, that’s too bad. Hey, wait! Aren’t you the guy who just ransacked the Capitol building in Washington, DC during the Electoral College vote count? ATV: Well, I didn’t exactly ransack the place. Please understand that emotions were running high and the police presence wasn’t exactly what it should have been. In any case, I have been ignored and ridiculed by the media for four long years and, to be honest, I am sick and tired of it. So one thing led to another and before I knew it, the police were waving me into the complex. blacklivesmatter : Excuse me, if I may interrupt for just a moment. Sure, go ahead, blacklivesmatter . blacklivesmatter : Angry Trump Voter, what you did in the capital of our great nation was truly disgusting and despicable. You and your deplorable racist rabble defiled the very heart of our democracy. You deserve everything you get for that unforgivable crime! ATV: Well, blacklivesmatter , aren’t you one to talk about defiling our country! It takes a special kind of hypocrite to burn the American flag, kneel during the American anthem and pull down statues of the American founders. And now you feign horror as Trump supporters dare to take an unscheduled tour of the Capitol Building during working hours? How quickly everyone forgets that just months ago, you were looting and burning a swath across the country, forcing people by threat of physical violence to declare their support of the blacklivesmatter cause. Most Americans are not racist, you know. Good morning to everyone except Commies who think they’re going to silence free speech in the USA. Not happening. Gentlemen, please! If we can just calm down and discuss this calmly and rationally… blacklivesmatter : We are fighting for a just cause! The noblest of them all, the equality of all men! But you, Angry Trump Voter, have desecrated the holiest of the holies, the very seat of our representative government! ATV: First, blacklivesmatter , we are not racists. The media will never tell you that more black people joined the republicanparty under Donald Trump than under any other conservative presidency in recent history. And yes, it is true that I entered the Capitol building, and perhaps that was unwise. But I did not loot or commit arson or declare a ‘self-autonomous zone’ like you did in Seattle alongside your radical Antifa buddies. Unfortunately, some people lost their lives, but far more people died over the course of the blacklivesmatter riots, with far more physical damage sustained. And let’s not forget that you too, blacklivesmatter , attacked federal property, particularly the Portland courthouse, where you engaged in violence against federal troops! blacklivesmatter : Dear misguided Angry Trump Voter, I’ll have you know that blacklivesmatter engaged in mostly peaceful protests, and even CNN supports that claim. But you looted from the Capitol building and behaved outrageously! Why, you put your feet up on Nancy Pelosi’s desk inside of her private office and even swiped her laptop! Wait a second. You put your feet on the desk of the Speaker of the House? ATV: Well, it was just for a selfie. I couldn’t resist. In any case, aside from the speaker’s podium, and a few other souvenirs, yes, I took Miss Pelosi’s laptop. blacklivesmatter : That is truly disgusting behavior, Angry Trump Voter. I am mortified and repulsed! Please, enlighten me. What is this strange fascination that you Trump people have with laptops anyways? First it was Hillary Clinton’s laptop, and then it was Hunter Biden’s. Now, you admit to stealing Nancy Pelosi’s laptop! You act like common street thugs! ATV: Well, blacklivesmatter , did you really expect me to waltz out of the Capitol building with nothing more than widescreen TVs and Nike sneakers like you and Antifa have a habit of doing during your looting sprees? And let’s face it, who knows what unsavory surprises one may find on a laptop. DEVELOPING: Democrats in both the House and Senate are planning to draft legislation to classify MAGA rallies as ""domestic terrorist activity"" and require the FBI, DOJ & DHS to take steps to prevent such ""domestic terrorism."" Sen. Durbin is leading effort along with Rep Schneider Oh, I have heard enough. This is unspeakable. To sneak a peek into a person’s laptop is no better than rifling through their underwear drawer. There are some lines that must not be crossed, sir! ATV: Big Tech, you are employing cheap hyperbole, hypocrisy and theatrics, just like everyone else on the left. For four years, Angry Trump Voter has been subjected to endless media-fueled conspiracy theories – debunked hoaxes like Russiagate and impeachment – and now you want to ignore any discussions about the possibility that the elections of November 3 were rigged in favor of Joe Biden. You want to play judge, jury and executioner based on your personal political beliefs, and then you wonder why a throng of people showed up in Washington, DC demanding attention. Big Tech, you are not an impartial arbitrator! Angry Trump Voter, I am very sorry, but I have heard more than enough of this nonsense. By the power invested in me, I have no other choice but to terminate your physical presence and the presence of your rascally leader, Donald J. Trump, from all social media platforms. You are a menace to society and a threat to yourself. ATV: What!? You can’t just shut down the voices of 75 million Americans! They will never stand for it! I m sorry, it s already been done. Oh, and please don’t hate me. Understand that I am working in your best interest. I am merely protecting you from yourself! Otherwise, at the encouragement of your reckless leader, you may go out and do something outrageous again. ATV: This is an outrage! We have behaved no worse than blacklivesmatter or Antifa! We will defeat you! We will smash your monopolistic grip on free speech! We have a constitution! Guards, please, remove this angry man from my sight! Such unacceptable behavior! blacklivesmatter , I apologize that you had to witness such an unsightly scene. You win today’s Sweepstakes and will get millions more in corporate support. And hopefully with Joe Biden as president we can finally look forward to an age of peace and unity in the United States. blacklivesmatter : God willing! No blacklivesmatter , Big Tech willing! Test.

"11 Jan, 2021",America’s risible coup attempt showed us yet again that white men are facing an existential crisis,"What’s the trouble with white men? It’s a legitimate question to ask. Last week’s Capitol riot was the latest in a series of events on both sides of the Atlantic that suggest they have lost their sense of place in the world. David Matthewsis a writer whose work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday and the Observer, and on the BBC and Channel 4. He is the author of several books, including Voices of the Windrush Generation. Follow him on Twitter@mrdavematthews. For me, one of the most iconicimagesof 2020 was that of 50-year-old father and grandfather of three Patrick Hutchinson, a black man, who was snapped saving a white ‘protester’ from a beating after a demonstration in London. Hutchinson and a group of friends were attending a right-wing rally in ‘defence’ of British monuments last summer – not in support of it, but to prevent blacklivesmatter counter-demonstrators from clashing with a mob of overweight, balding, middle-aged ‘patriots’ who had decided to converge on the capital and stand up against blacklivesmatter , the metropolitan elite, the police and anyone else who stood in their way. Hutchinson, and many others, both online and on the streets, had counselled both sides against violence. In the event, he wound up saving the bacon of 55-year-old Bryn Male, a retired transport cop and Millwall fan who was set upon by a small faction. During the fracas, Hutchinson was caught on camera shouldering the drooping, pathetic Male in a fireman’s carry through a crowd of blacklivesmatter supporters and oddly static riot police. While many focused on the physically impressive Hutchinson, it’s the limp, crestfallen, defeated Male that really tells the bigger story. And it’s a story that’s being told on both sides of the Atlantic about a much maligned, put upon and undoubtedly confused ethnic group: the average white man. An American episode of this story unfolded last week as a legion of weekend warriors and make-believe revolutionaries in designer camo, $200 hiking boots and assorted fancy dress performed an ‘attempted coup’ in the US by waltzing into the Capitol in Washington, largely unopposed. Without denigrating the political, symbolic, and human cost of the tragic events in D.C., one can easily afford the rabble or, as President-elect Joe Biden called them,“insurrectionists and domestic terrorists”a degree of power and influence they simply don’t deserve. Much has been made of the ease with which the mob broke into the Capitol – and how an equivalent blacklivesmatter or Muslim insurgency would have been instantly napalmed. Perhaps, when faced with those Trump-inspired protesters dressed as comic bookVikings, Grizzly Adams fanboys and Village People, the neutered security services were overwhelmed by the sheer absurdity of it all – and the white privilege such juvenile behaviour engenders. Another way of looking at, given the crucial role that old-time religion plays in American public life, is this: has an increasingly infantilised US culture spared the rod and spoiled the child? Or put another way, if white America doesn’t take itself seriously enough to tear gas and shoot other white people when they trample over democracy, aren’t more of these privileged insurrections to be expected, especially if the state continues to sponsor inequality by meting out excessive force to ‘the other’ while letting white miscreants off the hook? Like Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones, if you asked any one of the rabble last week what they were rebelling against, they would have dribbled,“Whaddaya got?”One“domestic terrorist”, having gained entry to US House of Representatives Speaker, Nancy Pelosi’s office, simply sat in herchairand posed for photographs. Another had showed up ready to bring truth to power wearing his work ID. It’s as though they want to get caught. Or more accurately, it’s as though they have no concept of how to avoid capture, let alone mount a revolution. As uprisings went, it was less Arab Spring and more American Pie. Apart from the commentariat’s view that the rabble had been ‘radicalised’ by Trump, what did they expect to achieve? Another failed legal bid to overturn a legitimate election result? The pack of jokers were the mirror image of the UK ‘Remoaners,’ who, nearly five years after the 2016 European Union referendum, are still in denial about the Brexit result. But there’s the rub: despite being diametrically opposed, politically and ideologically, the MAGA revolutionaries and Remoaners have one thing in common – a cry-baby sense of lost white entitlement. Faced with the multiple challenges of trade wars, cold wars, hot wars, culture wars, inter-federal and intra-federation crises – with Covid the cherry on top – white male America, like white male Britain, is at an existential fork in the road. Is the enemy within, or with-out? Do they follow blacklivesmatter ’s lead and stand up for themselves; or line up against blacklivesmatter , Antifa, the Jews, gays, the trans lobby, Muslims, women (at least the ones who answer back) and anyone else who isn’t a straight, white male? Have real and perceived external threats, such as wars on terror, wars on drugs and wars against ideologies, philosophies and ancient cultures overextended the average white male’s reach? Is having to compete on a (not even) level playing field really that hard? Essentially, what’s the trouble with white men? This isn’t a facetious question. Some of my best friends are white. In fact, I’ve asked the self-same question, on a more modest scale, of my own brethren. In 2004, I presented a three-part documentary series for BBC3 called The Trouble With Black Men ­– an exploration of some of the thornier issues young Afro-Caribbean males faced at the time, significantly around black masculinity and relationships, struggles with the education system and the workplace, and stereotypical associations with crime. The series was undoubtedly ground-breaking. But when I later met with the BBC to discuss a follow-up and pitched ‘The Trouble With White Men,’ the idea was dismissed as“obvious”despite evidence to suggest that the average white male was not – and still isn’t – a happy bunny. But then, as much of the British media is populated by white women, maybe there’s an internecine war going on that I haven’t been invited to. Average white male friends tell me the world is changing and they feel ill-equipped to deal with it; so they escape into football, booze, drugs and porn. And, while ordinarily they have the economic means to juggle these distractions while raising families, holding down jobs, paying off the mortgage and enjoying a couple of weeks a year in the sun, the free rein and lack of competition they once enjoyed is ebbing away. White men, I venture, are having a collective meltdown and the neat political movements that seek to co-opt or disempower them aren’t thinking about their ‘troubles’ but merely exploiting them for their own agenda. The idea that Donald Trump thinks those Capitol clowns are“special”is as much of a joke as liberal opprobrium against them is an underhanded insult to millions of people who maybe look like them, but certainly don’t act like them. The average white male isn’t railing against blacklivesmatter , Remoaners, the Democrats, women, the Labour Party and all that jazz – he’s railing against himself. He can be an airline pilot, a Hollywood actor, a tech billionaire… but where are the coal mines left to work in, the car plants to run, the trenches to be dug and the noble wars to be fought? If a robot hasn’t taken his job, some dude 10,000 miles away has. And for all of the black diaspora’s hardships, our arc is ever upward – which makes the average white man look increasingly out of touch. As Tom Ripley says in The Talented Mr Ripley,“I always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.”And that’s what last week’s ‘revolution’ was: a fake coup staged by a bunch of nobodies – a sentiment that’s being reflected in countless ironic, sarcastic and mocking memes. Amid the tragicomedy, it’s easy to take cheap shots at the ‘enemy.’ Joe Biden wants to embark on the long process of“healing”America. Good luck with that. I just hope he can inspire a nation of Pat Hutchinsons while saving the souls of a few Bryn Males. Now, that would be a real revolution. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"11 Jan, 2021","The Casablanca exit plan: If you’ve got a brain and a wallet, there are some easy loopholes to avoid the UK’s Covid lockdown","I’ve been lucky enough to flee virus-ravaged Britain, and if you look at the government’s own guidance, there are plenty of holes to be exploited. David Matthewsis a writer whose work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday and the Observer, and on the BBC and Channel 4. He is the author of several books, including Voices of the Windrush Generation. Follow him on Twitter@mrdavematthews. While Britain’s Tory government wobbles under the weight of its own incompetence, one of the oddest features of its half-baked response to the Covid crisis has been the gaping loopholes it’s handed to citizens who have the wit, guile and means to ‘get out of Dodge’. Like the organiser of a children’s treasure hunt, prime minstrel Boris Johnson leads each new public announcement by leaving handy clues on how to not just avoid the UK’s party-pooping lockdown measures but slip out of Britain altogether for those who find SARS-CoV-2 a bit of a bore. Take the latest National lockdown: Stay at Homeadvice:“You can only travel internationally – or within the UK – where you first have a legally permitted reason to leave home. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.”But what does“legally permitted”really mean? Reading between the lines, the Tories are giving away a free pass to anyone who fancies bending the rules – and has the resources and wherewithal to get away with it. For instance, who doesn’t have some sort of contractual obligation or family problem somewhere in the world that stands up on its own merits, or could be, let’s say, fashioned into an escape plan?  The government’s“reasonable excuse”that“you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property”sounds pretty vague to me. But if“legal obligations”sounds too fudgy, and you happen to be a professional, self-employed, a sole trader, an entrepreneur or even just fancy a change of scenery then the“work”or even“volunteering”clauses should cover it. As a journalist who’s contractually obligated by a publisher to write a book (I am) which potentially involves foreign travel (it does), I’d say if I hadn’t already buggered off I’d be free to leave the country – along with around half of the population. What’s really telling about the Tories’ phony travel ban is the bourgeois nature of it. If you invite some friends and family over to your modest flat to celebrate your daughter’s 21st birthday (something an old friend did recently) you could wind up facing a £10,000 fine. But jump in an Uber, head to the“free zone”of an airport and jet off to your gite in Provence and the worst that can happen is a £200 slap on the wrist. But who’s going to stop you, anyway? Where are the roadblocks, police checks or armed guards? Having a“contract”you can wave in some petty official’s face is now the ultimate McGuffin. It’s literally a“letter of transit”akin to the mythical exit visas so valued in Michael Curtiz’s 1942 Hollywood wartime classic, ‘Casablanca’. After escaping a Britain occupied by Covid recently, and finally making it to the“free world”of the Caribbean, I feel like the star of my very own ‘Casablanca’ while those I’ve left behind are bit part players in a weird political psychodrama. For despite Thatcher’s famous line that there’s“no such thing as society”and Brexiteers’ claim that they’ve“taken back control,”millions of Tory-loving Brits have become incapable of that most reactionary of traits: self-preservation. I have friends who have been floored by Covid, and lost relatives to it. Even as I write, a dear friend’s father is fighting for his life in ICU. Crucially, as a member of the so-called“BAME”community – and specifically a male of African descent – I’m nearlythree times more likelyto die of Covid than a white male counterpart. Whatever the origins of the virus, or the mouth-foaming conspiracy theories of certain social commentators, the virus’s deadly effects, right here, right now, seem pretty real to me. As I like breathing, by the end of November 2020 it was time to get out – while I still could. This may sound rich, but for me, leaving a country suffocated by a bumbling leadership wasn’t just a matter of survival – it was also an act of patriotism. Why bother hanging around when you not only have the means and opportunity to get out, but you can also help to free up vital resources via your absence? As a ‘digital nomad’, my tax pounds still go into Her Majesty’s coffers, so Britain gets all the benefits of me working remotely in the Caribbean and none of the burden on its infrastructure. At the heart of Casablanca’s narrative is the complex relationship between Humphrey Bogart’s cynical Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman’s ice cool Ilsa Lund and Czech Resistance leader, Victor Laszlo, played impeccably by Paul Henreid. In their own ways, each character is involved in an inner conflict about“doing the right thing”and thus by extension, the Venn diagram of the effect that their individual decisions have on each other and the wider world. In other words, the entire plot of Casablanca twists and turns, moment by moment, scene by scene, and act by act on a series of good versus bad or right versus wrong decisions. As a metaphor for Britain’s Covid age, Casablanca surpasses any of the slop that filmic or televisual dramas serve up these days. Boris Johnson’s Churchillian vaudeville act is in keeping with a creative landscape in the West that offers scant inspiration let alone introspection concerning the challenge of our age. If ‘Black Mirror’ or ‘Tenet’ is as good as it gets, then God help us. In the absence of effective political leadership and a litany of local, regional and central government public health scandals, where are the examinations of the state and its agencies? Compared with 1970s Hollywood, where paranoiac noir such as ‘Chinatown’, ‘Capricorn One’ and even the ‘Dirty Harry’ franchise asked serious questions about good governance, corruption and freedom of expression, what we get are scraps thrown at a credulous public by a Tory regime that doesn’t know its carrot from its stick. While there’s nothing illegal about applying the government’s travel rules and regulations with the maximum amount of minimal observance, voices from on high – and I mean HIGH – have started to question the ethics, morality and even spiritual meaning of leaving one’s country folk behind to die a slow, painful death while you sip mango daiquiris and work on your tan on some idyllic Caribbean beach. Pope Francis has berated callous tourists who have chosen to“escape the lockdown,”and ignore the suffering of their fellow citizens. In his weekly Sunday address, the Pontiff said:“I read in the papers something that quite saddened me: In a country – I don’t remember which – to escape the lockdown and have a good vacation more than 40 planes took off that afternoon.” I have no idea which country the papal one was referring to, but I’d bet the house on it being the UK. The Pope added:“Those people are good people, but didn’t they think of those who stayed at home, to the economic problems of many people who have been knocked down by the pandemic, to those who are ill?”before delivering an excoriating, if somewhat self-evident payoff, that these tourists’ desire was,“only to go on vacation, to have fun.” Far be it for me to argue with God’s representative on Earth, especially as part of me feels (and fears) deeply for friends and family who are trapped by work commitments and bound up in children’s schooling, relationships or concerned about elderly or frail parents. My mother and father are long gone, so other than my eldest daughter, who’s in her early 20s and carving out her own stellar MSM career (now from the comfort of her bedroom), I have barely any family left in the UK. A younger, feistier, more easily distracted me would probably have found exchanging the dynamism of London – a megacity of nine million – for somewhere with barely 300,000 people a little challenging. But faced with the UK’s 82,624+ andrising Covid deathsversus Barbados’sseven fatalities, and the physical, mental and economic fallout of staying in an increasingly tense London against riding out the storm in a tropical idyll where I can literally live the dream of writing on the beach, well… I don’t know where Covid-19 came from. And quite frankly, right now I don’t give a damn. Rather than indulge in meaningless conspiracy theories my concern is for the immediate and mid-term medical and economic effects – both which I have some agency over. So you can stick around and think you’re being a hero by standing up to Covid and laughing in its face. You can listen to the Hitchens and the Hopkins and all the other nativists who are quadrupling down on their conspiracy theories and agenda-laden rhetoric while the virological Nazis pummel the gates of Paris, a la Casablanca. Or you can use your brain and your wallet and get out while you can. You never know, if you act quickly enough there might even be something worth going back to.

"9 Jan, 2021",The Democrat-Big Tech censorship alliance just ran a masterclass in media control for dictators around the world,"Despite the mewling of the spineless American media, the real coup this week wasn’t committed by President Trump’s supporters, but by his opponents. They’re writing a manual on modern regime change, and it’s ready for export. When President Donald Trump’s supporters forced their way inside the US Capitol on Wednesday, they did not act as a unified force bent on seizing power. Instead they snapped selfies, looted souvenirs, and engaged in petty vandalism. While the rampage ended in tragedy for the protester shot dead by police, the police officer fatally injured, and the three others who suffered“medical emergencies”and died, it was soon snuffed out and Congress returned to work that evening to certify Joe Biden’s electoral victory. Their ringleader even urged them to go home and committed himself to the“seamless”transition of power to Joe Biden. Worst. Coup. Ever. Yet politicians on all sides and their enablers in the media swiftly declared it an“armed insurrection,”a“coup attempt,”and an example of“domestic terrorism.”‘Never Trump’ Republican Kurt BardelladescribedWednesday’s events as“symbolically worse than Pearl Harbor or 9/11,”while pundits described the littering and hooliganism as an assault on the“temple of our democracy”– you know, the same temple where respectable politicians vote on which foreign land their young soldiers will die in next. Worse than 9/11 according to our sacred news media:pic.twitter.com/MnxmiCWXrj There’s endless arguments to be made calling out the hypocrisy of America’s elites, who stood idly by as blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioters burned and looted the country all summer long, but principles do not matter to these people. Only naked power and the will to wield it. And wield it they did. As has become abundantly clear since Wednesday, the real coup was not against America’s ruling class, but by them. President Trump was immediately condemned by the media and lawmakers in both parties, as was expected. However, condemnation was followed by a chorus of elected officials demanding Trump be removed from office on grounds of unfitness to lead, using the 25th Amendment. Failing that, Democrats began hastily drawing up articles of impeachment against the president, with a vote on them expected as early as Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moved to restrict Trump’s powers as commander-in-chief, consulting with military top brass to prevent what she called“an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.” Incoming President Joe Biden compared pro-Trump Republicans to Nazis and promised to direct the Justice Department to lead a crackdown on“domestic terrorism.”The equation of Trump supporters to terrorists here is implicit. As politicians used every tool at their disposal to box Trump in, their allies in Silicon Valley made an unprecedented move. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter, his primary means of communication with the public, while thousands of accounts belonging to his supporters were deleted. A slew of other social media companies indefinitely suspended the president, with Facebook going further and banning all posts offering“praise and support”to the rioters, forbidding the sharing of images from inside the Capitol, and banning the organizing of similar protests. The significance of Silicon Valley’s involvement can not be overstated. Big Tech worked hand-in-glove with big government to de-person the president of the United States of America and prevent his supporters from organizing. Why such a crackdown would be instigated with just over a week left in Trump’s presidency boggles the mind. The social media companies have offered the justification of“keeping us safe,”but that’s likely a cop-out. Rather, by giving Trump theAlex Jonestreatment, they’ve effectively made him political poison and hampered any attempt he may make at announcing a 2024 bid. They’ve also set out a roadmap for how the Washington/Silicon Valley alliance will deal with any future threats to its power. Former First Lady Michelle Obama made this explicit on Thursday when shecalled ontech firms to step up their censorship efforts so that future“insurrection”can be prevented. Cutting off an opponent’s access to the media is step one in the regime change playbook, and the US government would know, havingwritten severalof them. When US-sponsored protesters deposed Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, the first building they seized after parliament was a TV station. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan avoided a communications blackout by using FaceTime to address the public during an attempted coup against him in 2016. Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak cut off internet access as protesters organized against him in 2011. Every coup or counter-coup hinges on media control, and the only difference between the deplatforming of Trump and the examples above are that for the first time,foreign regime-changestrategies are being openly deployed by Americans, against Americans, in America. As the country’s most despicable journalists and pundits cheer for the unaccountable tech tyrants, budding dictators abroad are surely taking notes. Building relationships with the tech titans is the modern equivalent of seizing a television studio, and popular movements can be easily suppressed with their cooperation. If the world’s loudest and proudest democracy is doing it, why can’t they? And who’s to say Silicon Valley’s giants themselves would stop at the US border? What is to stop them taking a dislike to some politician overseas and snuffing them out like Donald Trump? After all if the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth can be deleted, what chance do the rest of them have? Back in the US, Trump has far more supporters than the mob who broke into the Capitol on Wednesday. He has 75 million of them, more than the population of the UK. Denied the opportunity to speak freely online and with their views branded as“extremist,”would anyone be surprised if they decided to take more drastic action? After all, the regime changemanualcloses with a warning: an attempted coup only ever addresses“immediate issues and short-term, rather than longer-term, interests.”For the US, these long-termconsequencescould have the political class pining for a return to Wednesday’s hooliganism.

"9 Jan, 2021","After Capitol Hill riots, children rat out their right-wing parents to the media","With authorities tracking down the Trump supporters who barged into the US Capitol, teenagers have eagerly turned in their own family members who took part in the riot, and the media has encouraged the Stasi-style snitching. Days after President Donald Trump’s supporters forced their way into the US Capitol and ran riot throughout the building, police and prosecutors are working to identify and track down members of the mob. DC police have already arrested at least 80 people, and Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine told ABC News on Friday that his office would scour the internet for leads and ask the public to send in tips. However, a number of young people didn’t need to be asked twice. 18-year-old Helena Duke wasprofiledby Buzzfeed News on Friday for publicly outing her own mother, aunt, and uncle after she saw them in a photo from the Capitol. Duke told Buzzfeed that she ratted out her own family after her mother forbade her from attending a blacklivesmatter protest earlier this year. “Hi mom remember the time you told me I shouldn t go to blacklivesmatter protests bc they could get violent...this you?""she tweeted alongside a video showing her mother bleeding from the nose following a scuffle with a black woman. The tweet earned Duke praise from some liberal commentators but backlash from conservatives, and the teenager has since locked her Twitter account. However, she told Buzzfeed that she’s received messages from other teens who saw their family at the riot and agonized over whether to turn them in or not. One of these teenage touts, Robyn Sweet, wasinterviewedby Buzzfeed a day earlier. Sweet suspected her father – a supporter of Trump and member of a militia group – would travel to Washington for Trump’s rally on Wednesday, and outed him publicly after he was arrested inside the Capitol. Sweet told Buzzfeed that she was“ashamed and disgusted”by her father’s beliefs and actions, and said she no longer speaks to him due to his“conspiracy theories”and involvement in right-wing groups. Whatever the consequences for their familial relations, the US media has encouraged friends and relatives of rioters to inform on them to police. CNN hasboostedcalls for information from the FBI – while simultaneously describing thesocial ostracizationthat awaits them – and USA Today has asked its readers to fill out a form if they recognize any of the rioters caught on camera. Some readers chimed in with information and gloated about the repercussions the suspects would soon face, but others were troubled by the apparent“merger between press and state,”as well as the media’s lack of interest in identifying blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioters all summer. “They don t actually need your help with this,”writer Whitney Webbresponded.“What they want is for you to get used to the idea of ratting out your neighbors.” Though calls for information have proliferated in the aftermath of Wednesday’s riot, along with a draconian censorship crackdown by big tech, the public is already used to being told to snitch on each other. Amid coronavirus lockdowns, the British police andgovernmenthave encouraged citizens to tattle on their neighbors for breaking restrictions, as have authorities inCanada,Russia, and theUnited States.

"9 Jan, 2021",‘Stop making these damn Bolsheviks rich!’ Ben & Jerry’s slated for condemning ‘white privilege’ riot on Capitol Hill,"Ben & Jerry’s has diversified from the ice cream business, appointing itself an expert on national security and racism. Its explanation of the Capitol Hill riot as “white supremacy” left a sour taste in some customers’ mouths. Ben & Jerry’s is no stranger to corporate activism, and has released several #Resistance-pleasing flavors during President Donald Trump’s term in office: a vegan desserthonoringkneeling NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a ‘Pecan Resist’ flavor tofundraisefor anti-Trump organizations, and ‘Save our Swirled Now’, another vegan flavor to raise awareness of climate change. The Vermont company also regularly issues proclamations on current events, from a lengthypostthis summer declaring its support for the blacklivesmatter movement to a pro-immigration lecture aimed at the UK government this fall. However, the company has taken an even more solemn tone after pro-Trump protesters vandalized the US Capitol on Wednesday. “Yesterday was not a protest – it was a riot to uphold white supremacy,”Ben & Jerry’s tweeted on Thursday, kicking off a lengthy thread explaining how“the mostly white insurrectionists roamed freely and without consequence through the heart of our democracy.” Yesterday was not a protest—it was a riot to uphold white supremacy. (1/8) Calling the pro-Trump crowd the“ultimate embodiment of white privilege,”the dessert peddlers claimed that they would have been treated differently were they“Black, Brown or Indigenous people”–  capitalizing every race except“white”in an apparent bid for more woke points. In response to the“white tyranny”on display, the company called for the impeachment or deposition of President Trump, concluding“not one more day.” Of course, the company neglected to mention that an entire summer of blacklivesmatter riots were mostly“allowed to happen”too, or that co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield had been arrested at the Capitol in 2016 at a protest against money in politics. Unlike the pro-Trump rioters, however, Cohen and Greenfield stayed out of the building and kept the peace. Ben & Jerry’s latest proclamation satisfied the cravings of the anti-Trump crowd, whopraisedthe company for having“more integrity than our president,”andshowing“what it means to be anti-racist.” Just in case you needed any more reasons to love Ben & Jerry’s...https://t.co/LDTqlDYRpz I ll take 8 scoops of plain truth...https://t.co/lAgRPremff Amazing thread by amazing dudes. ❤️https://t.co/TtRqSgE6gX Yet for conservatives and Trump supporters, the lecture was one more reason to put down the spoon.“You shouldn’t be eating ice cream anyway,”right-wing pundit David Reaboitweeted.“Hit the gym, eat clean and stop making these damn Bolsheviks rich.” no one cares about what an ice cream brand thinks about politics 1/2https://t.co/8VgIQ5Ujgi Officially never buying Ben and Jerry’s again. I buy it because it tastes nice - I don’t want to associate politics with ice-cream so back to Haagen-Dazs who are apolitical as far as I know. I actually think Ben & Jerry’s are trying to troll people like me at this point Ice cream just went on an 8 tweet rant about a white supremacy conspiracy theory. Welcome to 2021.https://t.co/ohmYYWJVAT The Capitol Hill riot left five people dead: an unarmed protester was shot by police, a police officer was fatally injured by a rioter, and three others suffered“medical emergencies”and passed away. It has been condemned by Democrats and most Republicans, and by a multitude of America’s corporations, including the PR departments of Boeing, Goldman Sachs, and evenAxebody spray. Like this story?

"8 Jan, 2021",The shooting of Ashli Babbitt by Capitol police has echoes of blacklivesmatter icon George Floyd’s murder... but she will have no golden coffin,"Both died at the hands of police and both symbolise a cause, but US patriot Ashli Babbitt is branded a “domestic terrorist” after her death, while George Floyd became a martyr to millions and was buried in a gold-plated casket. WhenAshli Babbittpacked her Trump 2020 flag in her backpack and set off from her California home to join a pro-Trump rally on Wednesday, the last thing she would have expected was to end that trip lying on the floor of Washington’s Capitol building dying from a gunshot wound to her chest. In a strange way, her death at the hands of a law enforcement official, has much in common with that of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis who was murdered during a botched arrest attempt by a white policeman last May. Having just ducked out for some cigarettes, Floyd was soon to utter those immortal words “I can’t breathe,” which prefaced his death and led to global protests and the worldwide surge of interest in the blacklivesmatter movement. Like Floyd, Ashli Babbitt was a regular, working-class American simply struggling to keep her pool supplies company afloat. She was a 14-year veteran of four tours of the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, as a security forces controller. After leaving the military in 2016 she had her ups and downs, just like George. But like him, her sudden death was unexpected. And like him, it came at the hands of policemen and has caused tremendous uproar. Only one, however, will go to their grave condemned by President-elect Joe Biden as a “domestic terrorist.” And that is not George Floyd. For the past four years, President Trump has unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy.Yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack.pic.twitter.com/Mcli7mzENu Although he had a five-year prison stretch behind him, was a habitual drug user and at the time of his arrest was thought to be attempting to pass counterfeit money, now none of that matters. He was buried in a‘Promethean’ gold-plated casket– like Michael Jackson and James Brown – estimated to have cost $30,000 during a funeral at which boxing champion Floyd Mayweather picked up the tab. The coffin, the service, the celebrity paying the bill; all these were not because George Floyd was necessarily a valued member of the community whose contributions to society would be sorely missed. It was because of what his death represented. George is a modern-day martyr to a cause. Just as many will inevitably claim Ashli Babbitt is to hers. This simple 35-year-old Californian described herself on Twitter as a Libertarian who loved her “dude,” dog and country. That image doesn’t quite chime with that of Biden’s insensitive rebuke of the protesters as “domestic terrorists.” It is unlikely that anyone will be calling for a gold-plated casket in which to bury Ashli Babbitt, but you would expect that as veteran with a long career of honourable military service, she might be laid to rest with the Stars and Stripes draped over her coffin. That could put theUS Department of Veterans Affairsin an awkward position. If the family requests as much, the flag should be provided as it relates only to Babbitt’s service record while in the USAF, not what she did once discharged. While she might have flirted with the flat-earthers of QAnon and retweeted bonkers conspiracy theories as sheexplored politicsfree of the oversight of military service, these are not crimes under current US law and don’t point to her being some mad racist, Nazi, satanist or terrorist. Those who insisted on highlighting the flawed character of George Floyd were widely condemned, and now those efforts to paint Ashli Babbitt as something she wasn’t should also be resisted. While neither of these symbols of a deeply divided country could be called saints, George Floyd will always be remembered as the unwitting instigator of a movement that changed the way we think about race. Ashli Babbitt’s legacy is yet to be determined but she does not deserve condemnation for choosing to be a patriot. Joe Biden should take note. Think your friends would be interested?

"8 Jan, 2021",‘It s now pointless to refer to US as model of democracy’: Russian politicians react to storming of US Capitol building,"The leader of Russia s Communist Party believes that karma is striking back at the US after decades of Washington overthrowing leaders worldwide. His comments came after a violent mob attacked the American Capitol on Wednesday. Speaking to Moscow-based online news outlet Podyom, four-time presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganovsaidthat Washington’s propensity to fuel and encourage revolutions around the world is coming back to bite its elites at home. “They launched color revolutions, and in the last fifty years, they have carried out three dozen of them, if not more,”he said, specifically noting North Africa, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine.“Well, now they re paying for it.” In Zyuganov s opinion, the riots are a“consequence of a fraudulent theft campaign,”referring to the disputed claims by US President Donald Trump that widespread election irregularities are the reason for his loss in November s race for the White House. The communist leader also accused future President Joe Biden of being a“representative of globalist capital”who does not care about America but simply wishes to impose his values on the nation. Another popular opposition politician, ultra-nationalist LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky,tweetedthat Trump should“stay strong,”and foreign countries will help him out. Assessments of events in Washington on January 6 also caught the eye of Vyacheslav Volodin, the Speaker of the Duma (Russia s parliament) and a senior member of the ruling United Russia party. According to Volodin, recent events mean that the world should soon beginreconsideringthe form of democracy the US has imposed on the world. “After the events caused by the presidential election, it is pointless to refer to [the US] as a model of democracy,”said Volodin.“We are on the verge of re-evaluating the standards that are promoted by the USA, which exports its vision of democracy and party-political systems around the world.” “The United States would be right to address the shortcomings of its own political system. Many people have seen this before, but now it has become obvious to everyone.” Another influential figure in the United Russia party, Senator Aleksey Pushkov,saidthat the events in Washington“are not an attempted coup”and are“not a precursor to civil war,”but a sign of the end of“civil peace”in the US. “This process was launched not by Republicans, but by participants in the pogroms and protests of the past summer, led by blacklivesmatter and left-wing radicals,”Pushkov wrote on his Telegram channel. On Wednesday, Trump supporters broke into the Capitol in Washington, disrupting a meeting that was supposed to approve the results of the 2020 presidential election. The assault left five dead, and many more injured, and has led to some questioning why it was so easy to enter a vital government building. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"8 Jan, 2021","‘We sh*tted away 4 years’: LeBron James vents at Trump over Capitol disorder, claims black people have culture ‘stolen’ from them","NBA icon LeBron James has claimed America “sh*tted away four years” by electing Donald Trump as the Los Angeles Lakers star voiced his outrage over the violence in Washington DC this week. ""We live in two Americas,""James said on Thursday, speaking one day after pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. “And that was a prime example of that yesterday, and if you don t understand that or don t see that after seeing what you saw yesterday, then you really need to take a step back – not even just one step, but maybe four or five, or even 10 steps backwards and ask yourself, how do you want your kids, or how do you want your grandkids, or how do we want America to be viewed as? Do we want to live in this beautiful country? "" “I couldn t help but wonder, if it was my kind storming the Capitol, what would have been the outcome?""@KingJamesaddresses yesterday’s events in Washington, D.C.pic.twitter.com/Csgl7ZeSSi The 36-year-old star claimed that the ugly scenes of pro-Trump supporters breaching the Capitol building further exposed the double standards in the treatment of black people, after the stronger police reaction to the blacklivesmatter protests of 2020. Four deaths were linked to the violence in the US capital this week, before the news on Thursday that a police officer had also died of injuries sustained during clashes with rioters. READ MORE: Police officer dies after being injured during US Capitol riots “If those were my kind storming the Capitol, what would have been the outcome? And I think we all know,”added James, who wore a shirt bearing the slogan ‘Do you understand now?’ before the Lakers’ game against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday, and had the same message written on his shoes on court. “There’s no ifs, ands or buts, we already know what would ve happened to my kind if anyone would have even got close to the Capitol, let alone storm inside the offices, inside the hallways.” 🖤pic.twitter.com/1wLRnw1r6g James – who has frequently voiced his disgust of Trump during the Republican leader’s four-year tenure – added that those responsible for Wednesday’s unrest were“terrorists”. The star s diatribe continued as he claimed that the US benefits from black culture without paying its proper dues. “Do you understand how hard it is for us [black people] to continue to live our lives the way we live, continue to inspire, continue to give everything we got? “Everyone jumps on the bandwagon of what we provide, what we bring, the way we dress, our music, our culture, our food. Everyone steals from what we do, and then they want to act like they did it or they brought it to this world. “We don’t get our due diligence, the respect, we don’t get anything back from this country apart from a slap in the face,”James said. “We don’t get anything back from what we’ve given this country besides a slap in the face.”@KingJamesshares his thoughts on being Black in America.pic.twitter.com/d4sx6XnmD5 The four-time NBA MVP put the blame for the disorder firmly at Trump’s door, asserting that the US“sh*t away four years”by electing him in the first place. “The events that took place yesterday was a direct correlation of the president that’s in the seat right now, of his actions, his beliefs, his wishes,”James fumed. “He cares about nobody besides himself. Nobody. Absolutely nobody. He doesn t care about this country. He doesn t care about his family. He doesn t care about anybody besides himself… “Four years ago, I sat there and said this is the beginning of the end for our country. And hopefully it only lasts four years. “But the one thing you can t get back in life, one thing you can never get back, and that s time. Can’t get back time. We ve literally just sh*ted away four years. How do we recoup that?” Any fans hoping to enjoy sport without politics and protest in 2021 will likely be left disappointed, with stars such as James using their platforms to comment on this week’s scenes. In the direct aftermath of the violence on Wednesday, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics issued a joint statement in which they condemned the scenes, as well as expressing their disappointment after a Wisconsin prosecutor decided not to charge a police officer who shot Jacob Blake, a black man, last year. pic.twitter.com/MzCAxG0FLE RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"7 Jan, 2021","I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but how does a bloke in a Chewbacca bikini outwit the nation’s finest and storm the Capitol?","It’s hard to believe how the angry mob of Trump supporters managed to do what they did yesterday and the absence of police and security guards.

Follow her on Twitter@redrumlisa. I watched the astonishing breaking news from Washington yesterday like billions all over the world, our mouths agape, as the citadel of Western democracy was breached – Capitol Hill falls to the angry mob – and pondered one question. In a country that spends about 900 billion dollars a year on security and defence, that has made its name as the (often uninvited) police officer of the world, that loves going into other countries and ‘helping’ prop up one regime over another, or get rid of another it doesn’t like, all in the name of ‘democracy’... how is it possible that a couple of thousand of badly dressed and quite frankly weird folks break into the USA’s centre of power? I’m not a political or a historical expert on the USA, but I do love the country. It has always fascinated me – the opportunity, the dream, its brashness and its bollocks – and I especially love Las Vegas. The USA knows how to put on a good show –  it s what they do best – and yesterday’s was right up there with them. Because that’s what it was, in my view: a show. A stage-managed event. That’s the only explanation as to how this ramshackle group of people got into the Capitol building to disrupt political business regarding the transition of their most sacred of symbols, the POTUS. I watched the reruns of President Trump’s confused and quite mental rallying call to his followers earlier in the day – where he gave them the green light to march on Capitol Hill. I watched talking head after talking head compare the policing of the Trump supporters protest to that of the blacklivesmatter protests a few months ago – and only a fool would argue there was no difference. At the blacklivesmatter protest there were thousands of armed security ready and willing to crack heads and use weapons against protesters. Yet at the Trump rally – as far as I could see – there were a few blokes with radios in their hands running about. It’s not as if this showdown had not been written about and warnings given that Trump supporters would try to kick off on January 6 – it was all over the media for days beforehand. So I reckon the FBI, the Washington police, the Capitol Hill police, the national guard, etc. must have known of the potential for trouble, right? My granny would have heard about it and could have done a better job sorting the security. Yet the nation’s finest was hoodwinked by a bloke in a Chewbacca bikini who was now standing in the debating chamber, alongside a bloke in a Camp Auschwitz hoodie and others waving Confederate flags? I imagine that for most US citizens seeing your capital city in lockdown and the mayor ordering a 6pm-6am curfew, this symbolic act of protesters breaching a place that should be secure and attacking the very heart of ‘democracy’ must have been truly shocking. As a sociologist, I have been taught and trained in what we call ‘mapping the field’, meaning looking at the situation, assessing the power dynamics, seeing who are the winners and losers, and thinking critically about that. I know this particular field is a complicated one – the outgoing President Donald Trump is a vainglorious and narcissistic man, and his rants, lies and propaganda and purposefully divisive methodology has truly damaged his nation over the last four years. He’s caused greater divisions in an already divided society, setting himself up as ‘the anti-political politician’, and the result has been chaos, as his inept handling of the Covid pandemic demonstrated. He promised to clean up Washington, to drain the swamp, and to vanquish ‘the deep state’. But he failed miserably. And what if Wednesday, 14 days before he was due to depart the White House, was the deep state’s revenge, a stage-managed show designed to humiliate him and his supporters, and to reveal them in their true, disgusting colours?  And put paid to ‘Orange Man’ forever? I’m no conspiracy theorist, but it makes sense to me. Certainly, my sociological analysis thus far in this ever changing and dynamic situation is that the unleashing of the angry mob onto Capitol Hill was a good day for the forces of conservatism, the Washington elite, both Republican and Democrat, who have loathed Trump with a passion since he dared raised his coiffured head above the political parapet. So a good day for the political class – and a bad day for Donald Trump. He’s been forced to accept that the Joe Biden presidency must go ahead smoothly, while still smarting and whining and not accepting that he lost the election, and  – oh, imagine the withdrawal symptoms – not being able to tweet. A cynic might say that the day Trump’s mob was conveniently allowed to attack America’s democracy was the day that Trump was given enough rope to hang himself. Noose work, chaps. Like this story?

"7 Jan, 2021","Getting warmer: While insisting Antifa has nothing to do with the Capitol riot, NYT finally admits it is a ‘movement’","After months of fervent denials and rioting, Antifa is no longer being written off as a mere ideology by a US establishment outlet, which graduated them to “a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists.” “There is no evidence that Antifa activists stormed the Capitol,” the New York Times affirmed on Wednesday, blaming “the far right” for making “untrue claims that antifascist activists infiltrated protests.” There is no evidence that the antifa movement — a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists — stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.https://t.co/YD3PlqDlGIpic.twitter.com/Gru5XbBtP5 While some on the ground would beg to differ, the fact that the New York Times is even referring to Antifa as a semi-organized group is a divergence from its previous coverage, which described it as “a movement or ideology” rather than a real organization. The outlet even argued it was “impossible” to know how many members of Antifa existed due to its cell-like organizational structure. The NYT was attempting to “debunk” a longstanding claim that Antifa followers were dressing up as Trump supporters and committing wanton acts of violence in order to make conservatives look bad — in this case at the Capitol riots on Wednesday, which turned bloody and left four people dead including a woman shot by police. However, conservative provocateur (and sometime Antifa victim) Andy Ngo actually agreed with the outlet for once, arguing the protesters filmed swarming the Capitol did not look to be “antifa people dressed in Trump gear or Trump costumes.” The ‘paper of record’ has regularly come down on the side of Antifa in the past, noting that “supporters” (if not members) viewed the street violence that has become a hallmark of the group as merely in service to a greater good. Right-wing ideas, the group supposedly believes, must not be presented to the general public, lest an unaffiliated individual fall in line with the “targeting of marginalized people.” The paper admitted doxxing and violent confrontation were part and parcel of the Antifa ‘ideology,’ while arguing in favor of such ‘preemptive strikes’ against the so-called alt-right. Even FBI director Christopher Wray paid lip service to the notion that Antifa was not an organized group in September, attempting to please both President Donald Trump and his detractors by agreeing that while there was no such thing as an Antifa member, the group’s supposed ideology was a “real thing” and that “violent anarchists” might “self-identify” with Antifa. As recently as September, the NYT was still claiming Antifa was “not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.” Instead, it was “a loose movement of activists whose followers share some philosophies and tactics.” Any claims of Antifa members fighting alongside blacklivesmatter were declared delusional conspiracy theories fueled by an ‘irresponsible’ president. Trump has long sought to have Antifa labeled as a terrorist organization, particularly as violence raged in cities across the nation in the wake of the death of black Minneapolis man George Floyd at the hands of the police. Former attorney general William Barr claimed back in June that his Justice Department had evidence Antifa and its ideological allies had been “involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity” that followed Floyd’s death. However, even Barr insisted Antifa was “a very loosely organized group,” even while acknowledging there was “clearly some high degree of organization” within and what appeared to be serious funding.

But he’s still a hero to many, so why not start a party of his own?","President Trump is being vilified for events in Washington yesterday and his future is unclear.

He was Professor of Liberal Arts at NYU from 2008 through 2019. Follow him on Twitter@TheAntiPCProf Clearly, the word ‘tensions’ fails to describe the political situation in America. The contested presidential election exacerbated bitter antagonisms between the Trump contingent and ‘the resistance’, rending, perhaps irreparably, what had already been a severely frayed social and political fabric. At a rally organized by Women for America First, the Eighty Percent Coalition, and Stop the Steal, President Trump delivered a typically provocative speech before an estimated crowd of 250,000 people. After repeating detailed allegations of massive electoral and voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, he ended by calling on protesters to march to the Capitol. Some decided to storm the Senate building – to stop, literally, the counting of contested Electoral College votes, which they managed to delay. Protesters breached several security fences and pushed back against police in full riot gear before finally busting out large windows and making their way into the Senate Rotunda. In the chaos that ensued, four people lost their lives. Meanwhile, pro-Trump crowds marched on state capitols across the country. Commentators from the media and both major political parties have been quick to condemn the rebellion, but few have ventured to explain the event. Yet many factors contributed to the rage that fueled the siege. It cannot simply be attributed to Trump’s rhetoric. Questions about the election might have been addressed by the judiciaries in the various states before the electoral vote count was set to proceed in the US Congress. I won’t reiterate the allegations here, but it’s not true that the allegations have been examined and dismissed. They haven’t been examined at all, either in the media or under official auspices. If they had been, perhaps Trump could have left the talking points to other interlocutors, although it’s doubtful. But distrust for the electoral process added fuel to an already raging fire. Unremitting attempts on the part of Democrats to destroy his presidency frustrated Trump and his supporters across his four-year tenure. A politically motivated pandemic response cost many their jobs, businesses, and personal freedoms. Civil unrest undertaken by the leftist Antifa and blacklivesmatter groups went on unabated for many months, while Trump supporters, locked down, looked on helplessly. Online censorship was applied asymmetrically to conservative and right leaning users and increased in intensity during the election season. Dismissed and lied to by the media, disdained by the political class, censored and subjected to propaganda on social media, and mocked by the intelligentsia, many Trump supporters felt they had nothing left to lose in terms of reputation. Several hundred put everything on the line for the cause. The double standard that these Trump supporters labor under will now be redoubled. Their violence has been deemed inexplicable and contemptible, while leftist violence was ignored or excused for the better part of a year. While the revolutionaries may figure the insurrection as a reconnection with 1776, it represents a decisive break with the recent past. The republicanparty may have tolerated or feigned tolerance for Trump and his supporters, but that tolerance is now over. Trump supporters may have been done with the republicanparty but now the party may be finished with them. Trump was always a political outsider, but now he may become an outcast. Even his Twitter and Facebook accounts have been locked. Repeat, the social media accounts of the president of the United States have been disabled, at least temporarily. Trump will now be blamed for and tainted with the events of January 6. Calls for his removal from office before January 20 under Article 25 of the Constitution are already being voiced. Likely, Democratic leaders will argue that he should be tried for treason after he leaves office. This means that the Trump era is either over, or that it will take a dramatically different form. Trump will either start his own party and attempt to build on his ‘deplorable’ base, or otherwise fade into political oblivion. The mainstream media will consign him to the hall of infamy. For Trumplicans, Trump will remain an American hero of the first order. What becomes of Trump populism remains unclear at this point. But it doesn’t look as if the Trump-inspired base is going to lie down any time soon. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"7 Jan, 2021",‘Had to make it about race’: NBA champ fuels predictable row by comparing Capitol Hill clashes to blacklivesmatter demos (VIDEO),"NBA head coach Doc Rivers has claimed that the police response to the protests on the Capitol ""prove a point"" about racial discrimination in the US, leading to an online row that has been stoked by other prominent sports figures. Philadelphia 76ers boss Rivers, who accused outgoing president Donald Trump s republicanparty of ""spewing this fear"" in August, was unflinching in his appraisal of the shocking unrest at the US Congress, watching in horror as violent clashes led to the deaths of four people. The former NBA All-Star and NBA Coach of the Year dismissed a suggestion that the uproar, caused when pro-Trump demonstrators descended on the Capitol to challenge the US presidential election result, was an ""assault on democracy"". ""Democracy will prevail, it always does,""said the forlorn-sounding 59-year-old in a pre-game press conference. “Could you imagine today if those were all black people storming The Capitol and what would have happened?”Powerful comments from Doc Rivers pregame, worth your time listening to the full thing.@FOX29phillypic.twitter.com/bScsAfmlGo Black people get pulled over and don’t make it out alive. We can’t sleep in our own beds without being killed. We can’t jog without being killed. We can’t walk down the street with our hoodies up without being killed but they can do this???https://t.co/j59OMKw4LO Indeed.https://t.co/PwFXrb4wnL ""It shows a lot, though: when you saw the [ blacklivesmatter ] protests in the summer, you saw the riots, or more the police and the national guard and the army. ""[For] this, you saw nothing. It basically proves a point about a privileged life, in a lot of ways. ""I ll say it because I don t think a lot of people want to: can you imagine, today, those were all black people storming the Capitol, and what would have happened? The way they would have dropped a whole bomb on the capitol if this was us. Why aren’t you condemning the blacklivesmatter protest? Because they fit your narrative. Ah had to make it about race ""That, to me, is a picture that paints a thousand words for all of us to see. People peacefully being escorted out of the Capitol. ""It s a sad day - not good for our country, or across the borders. People see this, but it s a part of what we are and we have to solve it."" Rivers s remarks received a mixed reaction online, including many responses shunning his suggestion that the scenes spoke of a racially-motivated reaction while arguing that the point of the protests was entirely to do with the validity of the election. ah had to make it about one of the biggest ongoing issues in america It’s really not it’s just the media playing it up I don’t understand why some black people are making this an issue of race! It’s about people thinking an election was rigged. Two completely different things! ""I don’t understand why some black people are making this an issue of race,""said a Philadelphia Eagles fans. ""It’s about people thinking an election was rigged. Two completely different things."" Another replied:""Nobody is making this about race except for the media. Why is a hypothetical situation relevant in the slightest bit?"" Didn’t seem like they had too many problems when they were killing civilians and burning business to the ground. Actually I remember celebrities paying for their bonds so they could be released from jail They just spent months destroying property, looting, and setting historical buildings on fire. Don t need to imagine it. nobody is making this about race except for the media.. why is a hypothetical situation relevant in the slightest bit NBA great Dwyane Wade shared a photo from inside the Capitol that appeared to show a non-violent confrontation including people wearing Trump s familiar ""Make America Great Again"" baseball caps. ""Black people get pulled over and don’t make it out alive,""said the three-time NBA champion.""We can’t sleep in our own beds without being killed. ""We can’t jog without being killed. We can’t walk down the street with our hoodies up without being killed, but [the protestors] can do this?"" African-American film director and former NFL player Matthew Cherry made an even more extraordinary claim, declaring that ""they would have dropped a whole bomb on the Capitol if this was us."" Political soapbox regular and former England football favorite Gary Lineker echoed Rivers s line by endorsing a message from a broadcaster and blacklivesmatter supporter showing a clip from the Capitol. ""Can you imagine what would happen to them if they were black?""they asked, to which Lineker replied for the benefit of his millions of followers:""Indeed.""

"7 Jan, 2021","‘This is on you, Mr President’: Angry wrestling legend Mick Foley blasts ‘son of a b*tch’ Trump in plea to WWE boss Vince McMahon","Donald Trump is to blame for violence inflicted on police during the shocking protests at the US Capitol and should be dumped from the WWE hall of fame, wrestling legend Mick Foley has urged in a series of political tweets. American veteran Foley was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, the same year that CEO Vince McMahon honored Trump, who has since hosted his fellow billionaire businessman at the White House. Four people died in chaotic scenes at the US Congress on Wednesday, when pro-Trump protestors mobbed Washington to protest against the presidential election result in a demonstration that was encouraged by the outgoing head of state. ""Hey, Vince - how about throwing this sorry son of a b*tch out of our Hall of Fame?""asked a clearly furious Foley, telling the government to invoke the 25th Amendment that would temporarily oust Trump on the basis of the defeated Republican being unable to perform his role. This is on you, Mr President. Every single injury today is on you.https://t.co/6wJKb0pUxa Hey Vince - how about throwing this sorry son of a bitch out of our Hall of Fame?@VinceMcMahon House and Senate members:1) I hope you are all safe2) Any chance of working a quick#Article25vote into today’s agenda? McMahon seems unlikely to denounce or punish Trump given that the sports mogul took part in an event, dubbed The Battle of the Billionaires, in 2007 in which he allowed Trump to tackle him to the ground and shave his head. The former wrestler also gave millions to Trump’s 2016 campaign and his now-defunct foundation, according to Politico. Foley also likened senate leader Mitch McConnell and vice-president Mike Pence s resistance to Trump s direction to challenge the election result to a classic wrestling match between Sgt. Slaughter and The Iron Sheikh in 1984. Wait, is he really in the wrestling hall of fame? Time for him to go - thank you for speaking up, king. won t happen.pic.twitter.com/mdGhaDQahm YES! YES! YES!!!

""I did not see a SINGLE hint of compassion for the families of the 50,000 Americans who have died from Covid since that day. ""The President seems incapable of compassion.

Thinking of all of you under lockdown in the UK - and wishing you the very best during a difficult time. Foley went on to retweet a message by Steve Schmidt, the Republican aide who has worked on campaigns for the likes of former president George W Bush, describing the riots as a ""profound national humiliation"" that had turned the US into a ""banana republic"". He also echoed a statement from broadcaster Peter Rosenborg saying:""If these were blacklivesmatter protestors, we would be witnessing a bloodbath. Racist white supremacy privilege at its finest today."" Earlier in the week, Foley had offered a message to his fans on the other side of the Atlantic as they entered lockdown for a third time during the pandemic.

"6 Jan, 2021",‘We will never concede’: Trump vows to fight on during DC rally as Congress set to certify election for Biden,"US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his conviction that his political nemeses stole his rightful victory in November. In a rally outside the White House, the president declared he will “never concede.” Trump delivered his remarks in front of a large crowd of supporters, many of whom were in Washington for the ‘Save America’ rally to protest the allegedly stolen election. “We will never give up, we will never concede,” the president said. “You don’t concede when there’s theft.” We will not take it anymore. Trump focused on the voting statistics, which saw the president receiving more votes than any previous incumbent but still being bested by Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump repeatedly expressed his desire to “go back eight weeks” and fix the alleged fraud before it tainted the vote. The president went on to denounce the “weak Republicans” who refused to back his election-fraud crusade even after he helped some of them get elected. However, he had harsher words for the Democrats, noting that if it was Biden who’d been “cheated” by a Republican candidate, mobs would be destroying small businesses, as happened during summer blacklivesmatter protests. “If [Republican congressmen] don’t fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight,” Trump warned. Trump continued to go after the vote-counting, declaring it “so corrupt that in the history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it.” He likened the sudden spike in Biden votes on Election Day night to “explosions of bulls**t,” then mocked failed candidates including Mitt Romney (R-UT) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. At one point Trump seemed to be talking directly to Vice President Mike Pence, all but obligating him to challenge the Electoral College results. While crowds of Trump supporters thronged the area to do their part to ‘Stop the Steal,’ states already certified their votes last month. Wednesday’s vote is more of a formality- though that hasn’t stopped the president from putting pressure on his VP in the hope of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.

"6 Jan, 2021","Trump to speak at ‘Save America’ rally outside White House, warns ‘terrorist’ Antifa to stay out of DC","US President Donald Trump has confirmed he will address the crowds gathering in Washington, DC as Congress prepares to certify the election, while warning the ‘terrorist organization’ Antifa to stay away. “Stay out of Washington,”Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening, calling Antifa a“terrorist organization.”He added the law enforcement is watching“very closely”and tagged the FBI, the Defense Department, the Justice Department, Homeland Security and Interior – which runs the US Park Police, responsible for federal property in DC – in the tweet. Antifa is a Terrorist Organization, stay out of Washington. Law enforcement is watching you very closely!@DeptofDefense@TheJusticeDept@DHSgov@DHS_Wolf@SecBernhardt@SecretService@FBI He also confirmed that he would address the Save America rally at 11am local time on Wednesday, urging“big crowds”to arrive early as“doors”to the Ellipse – an open space on the south side of the White House – will open at 7 in the morning. I will be speaking at the SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early — doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!pic.twitter.com/k4blXESc0c Thousands of the president’s supporters have arrived in the US capital ahead of Wednesday’s joint session of Congress that is expected to certify the election of Democrat Joe Biden as president, even as 150 or so Republican lawmakers said they would object. Trump appears to be expecting Vice President Mike Pence to“reject fraudulently chosen electors,” meaning the delegations from five states in which his campaign alleged misconduct in administering the vote and even outright fraud. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump said he hoped the Democrats will take notice of the protesters who“won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen.”Even more importantly, he said, the“weak and ineffective RINO [Republican in Name Only] section of the republicanparty ”should pay attention. HetaggedSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), and Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas) and John Thune (R-South Dakota), all of whom have refused to back his challenge to the legitimacy of the November 3 election and urged the party to move on into the Biden presidency. “Washington is being inundated with people who don’t want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats,”Trump tweeted.“Our Country has had enough, they won’t take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Washington is being inundated with people who don’t want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won’t take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! His social media manager Dan Scavino took the“hear you and love you”literally, tweeting out a short video in which music and chanting of protesters could be heard from the West Wing. 🔊WOW! We hear you from the West Wing—THANK YOU❤️🇺🇸🦅pic.twitter.com/onytmaJUhp DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, hasrequestedthe National Guard as backup and urged residents to refrain from engaging with protesters who“come to our city seeking confrontation.” Meanwhile, DC policearrestedProud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who flew into the capital to take part in the Trump rally. Tarrio was arrested for“destruction of property”– referring to the Proud Boys destroying a blacklivesmatter during a protest last month – but then additionally charged with possession of“two high-capacity firearm magazines,”though no weapon for them. A DC judge has ordered Tarrio to stay away from the District entirely, citing his own social media posts admitting to torching a blacklivesmatter banner and saying he’d“do it again,”and noting there are such signs and murals all over the city.

"5 Jan, 2021","Five MSM corona-flops of 2020: With Covid still on scene, don’t fall for ALL of the media’s fearmongering this year","With a new year comes a new strain of coronavirus and a new wave of fear-porn news stories. But as 2020 proved, you can’t trust everything the media tells you about Covid-19. A year since it first spread beyond China and engulfed the world, Covid-19 hasn’t abated. Some 88 million people worldwide have caught the deadly illness, and nearly two million have perished. With a new and more infectious strain on the rise, governments have implementeddraconian restrictionson liberties and urged their populations to get vaccinated, withfurtherdeprivationsof freedoms on the horizon for those who refuse. Ahead of an uncertain year, in which a return to normality looks ever more distant, the mainstream media is standing by to bring you the most graphic and terrifying stories of the virus’ impact – like the New York Times did last week in a photofeaturechronicling the“wave after wave”of the virus that hit Europe, or two weeks earlier when itdescribedthe“unseen and incalculable”scars of survivors. But these stories won’t always be trustworthy. The media proved this on numerous occasions during 2020, often peddling fake news to earn clicks or push their narrative. The mainstream media went to great lengths in 2020 to warn the public of dangerous“misinformation”about Covid-19, in particularanythingthat smacks of anti-vaxx sentiment. Yet the“trustworthy”information broadcast by the media changed by the day. First, Americans weretoldto“get a grippe,”and remember that“the flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus.”They weretoldthat“people in the United States shouldn’t panic.”However, they were soon told the exact opposite, asarticlesadvising them“how to sleep with coronavirus anxiety”and how toweatherthe“mental and emotional fallout of living and working through a pandemic”soon replaced these soothing stories. Of course, nobody can issue authoritative declarations at the beginning of a new and unknown pandemic, and our collective understanding of the coronavirus changed repeatedly last year as new facts came to light. Still, some media outlets seemingly preferred to pretend they were right from the beginning. Vox, for example, told its readers in March that they could“pass on”face masks, calling them“only useful if you have a respiratory infection already.” When mask-wearing became gospel, Vox deleted its tweet. However, it wasn’t the first time the liberal news site u-turned on its own statements. Shortly before tweeting about masks in March, Vox deleted a tweet from January in which it confidently declared:“Is this going to be a deadly pandemic? No.” When the new coronavirus hit American shores, New York was the first city to see mass hospitalizations. Back in March, CBS News ran video footage showing an overcrowded hospital ward in the city, featuring nurses in protective gear scrambling to tend to bedridden patients. In reality, the footage was shot in a hospital in Bergamo, Italy, by Sky News several days earlier. Once found out, CBS blamed its inclusion on an“editing mistake”and removed it from all of its shows. CBS News is under fire for using footage of the “worst hit” hospital in Bergamo, Italy to illustrate a report about the coronavirus outbreak in New York.https://t.co/1vIxv4tzCO CBS wasn’t the only news outlet caught recycling footage during the pandemic. Just last month, viewerscaughta local news station in Los Angeles using scenes from a Brooklyn hospital in March to portray LA’s hospitals“at their breaking point.” Stories of human tragedy abound during the Covid-19 pandemic, but in their hunger for tear-jerking moments, some mainstream media outlets broadcast some straight-up fake news. A clip originally broadcast by CBS in April showed nurse Imaris Vera bursting into tears and describing how she quit her job after“none of the nurses”in a dedicated coronavirus unit were wearing masks. Furthermore, she called out her Chicago hospital for banning nurses from using their own protective equipment in the facility. “America is not prepared,”she sobbed,“and nurses are not being protected.” Vera’s acting fooled CBS – and Vermont SenatorBernie Sanders– until it emerged that she had actually been given an N95 mask to wear, and that she quit on her first day back on the job, after taking a year out to build a career as an Instagram model and promote her own brand of boutique scrubs. Thevideo, complete with captions and dramatic music, is still available on CBS’ Twitter page. Whatever public health diktats our governments issue and our journalists promote this year, expect them to disregard these rules the moment the cameras switch off. Sky News’ Kay Burley spent months hammering UK politicians like Dominic Cummings for breaking their own lockdown rules, only to be caught dining out last month with nearly a dozen colleagues to celebrate her birthday. She wasn’t the only media moralizer to fall on her own sword. Piers Morgan advocated for closing pubs and canceling Christmas, and branded those who disobeyed the British government’s draconian lockdown“Covidiots.”That is, until his son fanciedmarchingin London with ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protesters in July. Across the Atlantic, journalists savaged President Donald Trump for forgoing his face mask, until the cameras stopped rolling. In just one day in May, CNN’s Kaitlin Collins grilled Trump for not wearing a mask, beforeslipping hers offfollowing a subsequent White House press briefing, once Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany walked off the podium. Russia’s Sputnik V was the world’s first registered Covid-19 vaccine, and its arrival on the scene drove much of the western media hopping mad. Theysounded the alarmover its hasty approval, called it a“propaganda instrument,”and declared that taking“Putin’s vaccine”would be akin to playing“Russian roulette”with one’s life. As it turned out, Sputnik Vpassedits Stage-3 clinical trials with flying colors, and was deployed to the Russian public in early December. More than 50 countries signed up to purchase doses of the vaccine, and British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca signed an agreement late last month to research the possible benefits of combining shots of its own vaccine with Sputnik V into a single immunization regimen. Meanwhile, authorities in the US and UK had no problem issuing similar emergency authorizations to US drug firm Pfizer, while the mediacelebratedthe first shots of the company’s vaccine being administered. Funny how vaccine skepticism only works one way. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"4 Jan, 2021","DC mayor taps NATIONAL GUARD for Trump rally, gets reminded that MAGA crowds ‘aren’t the ones that torch & loot’","Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has requested National Guard troops and urged residents to avoid downtown as Donald Trump supporters plan to descend on the US capital to protest the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Bowser’s office told media outlets on Monday that she had asked the National Guard to send about 340 unarmed troops to help District of Columbia police and firefighters to manage demonstrations by supporters of President Trump, but noted only 115 would be deployed at once. The mayor advised Washington residents to stay out of the downtown area and refrain from engaging with protesters who“come to our city seeking confrontation.” Mayor Bowser has called up the National Guard to help police manage the pro-Trump demonstrations Tuesday and Wednesday. Ironically, the mayor made no such call for military help when blacklivesmatter protesters set fires, vandalized national monuments and hurled rocks and bottles of urine at Secret Service agents earlier this year. In fact, Bowser in Junecalled on Trump to withdrawNational Guard soldiers and other federal forces who had been deployed to help quell riots. The mayor even renamed a street in front of the White House“ blacklivesmatter Plaza”and ordered that the blacklivesmatter slogan to be painted on the pavement in giant letters. On Monday, conservatives reminded her that it wasn’t MAGA protesters who caused havoc in the city. Dear@MayorBowser:@realDonaldTrumpsupporters weren’t the ones rioting, looting big-screen TVs from Best Buy, tearing down Lincoln statues, torching churches, throwing rocks at police, and beating up innocent bystanders.Those were# blacklivesmatter ,#antifa, & other@JoeBidensupporters.https://t.co/gRsAFwsjOS “Donald Trump supporters weren’t the ones rioting, looting big-screen TVs from Best Buy, tearing down Lincoln statues, torching churches, throwing rocks at police and beating up innocent bystanders,”Republican lawyer Mike Davis said.“Those were blacklivesmatter , Antifa and other Joe Biden supporters.” Why did DC’s mayor Muriel Bowser just ask the National Guard to shut down the Stop the Steal rally happening this Wednesday, but Bowser allowed weeks of violent blacklivesmatter riots?🤔 Self-described“classical liberal”Sally Eastman agreed, saying:“Muriel Bowser is a coward. She cannot fathom that a few hundred thousand people could peaceably assemble to protest because all she understands is rioting and looting.” #MurielBowseris a coward. She cannot fathom that a few hundred thousand people could peaceably assemble to protest bc all she understands is rioting and looting. blacklivesmatter and Antifa activists have had violent clashes with conservatives at gatherings in Washington last year. People leaving Trump’s Republican National Convention speech at the White House in August, including Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and his wife, were accosted by mobs of leftist protesters. Bowser, however, blamed Trump supporters for violence that erupted following demonstrations. Yeah, our mayor is out of her mind! The damage and division she’s caused in The District is freaking shameful! Bowser told reporters on Monday that guns won’t be permitted at this week’s protests, and she may impose a curfew. Washington Police Chief Robert Contee said his department had received information indicating that some people plan to bring guns to the city.

"3 Jan, 2021",A creeping black vs. black schism is dividing America as some descendants of slaves demand a special status over immigrants,"The blacklivesmatter movement has shone a spotlight on many racial issues and has inadvertently led to a higher profile for the issue of how American Descendants of Slavery are treated, and what their place is in US society. Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney ‘Judas and the Black Messiah’, thebiopicof assassinated Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton, is the type of movie you’d expect to spark controversy. But most wouldn’t expect it to be in the form of criticism that a black man was cast in the lead role. The issue for some is that he’s the ‘wrong type’ of black, as Daniel Kaluuya is a Londoner with Ugandan parents. They instead wanted the role to go to a not-very-well-known subset of the black diaspora, an American Descendant of Slavery (ADOS). One infuriated black America womantweeted:“Why is Daniel Kaluuya in the US seeking roles of Black American#ADOScivil rights icons? If he doesn t want to talk about race, seek other roles, stay away from ADOS history. Our history is the story of a people forced into a race struggle.” The spat has offered a glimpse into a passionate and raging debate that many will be unaware of. In 1988, Rev. Jesse Jackson popularised theterm‘African American’. The problem is that African or West Indian immigrants to the US can also be classified under that category, alongside black people born in America. The concept of ADOS is to carve out an identity and pathway exclusive to just the descendants of slavery in North America. It’s a complex matter, and it excludes millions of individuals. For example, one of the founders of ADOS, Antonio Moore, has spoken about how Barack Obama should not be seen as one of them, as the former president’s mother was white and his father Kenyan:“Barack Obama rode the narrative of slavery, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., and the celebrity cache of Oprah, all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.” The ADOS approach is causing increasing tension between groups in everyday life. Writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who moved to the US from Nigeria to study at the age of 19, has experienced such issues, explaining,“There is a certain kind of black American that deeply resents an African whom they think of as privileged, privileged Nigerians especially. My husband and I have got to the airport and they’ve said to us, ‘You’re Nigerian, I bet you have twenty-five thousand dollars in your bag, let’s see it.’” The converse viewpoint also exists. William A. Darity Jr. of Duke University is one of the leading scholars in the field, and he produces much of the content that ADOS proponents rely on. He told RT this week:“The irony is recent black immigrants seem resistant to the ADOS assertion of a distinct ethnic identity while maintaining their own identity as Nigerian (even more narrowly as Igbo), Ghanaian, Jamaican, etc.” The idea of being divided into a social category by skin colour is alien to most Africans. Kenyan writer Mkawasi Mcharo Hallexplains:“Our identity was and still is ingrained in ethnicity, not in skin color. It explains why most Africans experience being called black or African for the first time when they come to America.” There are simple examples of this. Amala and Efo riro are popular Nigerian dishes, but they wouldn’t be accurately described as African, in the same way haggis would be classed Scottish and not European. It’s also common for immigrants to grasp their culture to a greater degree than they did previously. The basic human condition of wanting to feel at home results in families creating local groups, or opening shops to import their national products. There is no malice – it’s an instinct, as most people feel some connection to their homeland and want to express it. That communal rallying point doesn’t exist for ADOS. Due to the horrific crimes committed against their ancestors, they don’t know where they came from. Most slaves arrived in the Americas from West Africa, with Benin evenapologisingfor its role in selling fellow Africans back in 2000. This is a point that s a major motivation for the all-black militia NFAC leader Grand Master Jay, whotold RTearlier this year,“We have no identity, they call us African Americans but tell me, where in Africa? There are 55 countries in Africa.” The schism is exacerbated, as African immigrants generally have higher average earnings than ADOS, while they and their children tend to do better academically. The key behind their success is they have a better level of education and therefore can command greater salaries – as Darity Jr. explainedm“Generally immigrants who are hyper-selected from the population of their country of origin do better than the native-born population, on average, in the receiving country. Hyper-selectivity means the immigrant population has a higher level of education and financial resources than the average for their fellow citizens. Recent African immigrants to the US represent an extreme of hyper-selectivity; they are better educated than most Americans, black or white, upon arrival.” Astudy in 2013showed that 35 percent of African immigrants had a college degree, higher than the entire US population (30 percent) and far more than ADOS (19 percent). It also revealed that the average salary for a black immigrant was $43,800 and for ADOS it was $33,500 – although the US average was $52,000. Along with pressure from some parties for a greater role for ADOS in the arts, namely using their own actors to play real-life characters, there s also an ongoing campaign for reparations for slavery, which would only be given to those who can prove an ADOS lineage. So if someone was descended from slaves in Barbados, they wouldn’t be eligible. As we move into the new year, I challenge#ADOS/our allies 2 stay focused, remain steadfast & on mission, keep growing in understanding & agile enough 2 try new strategies 4 new challenges. We have what it takes 2 do what most think is impossible. Stay exceptional!✊🏾#Reparationspic.twitter.com/Yg1k0pGlJX Darity Jr. said,“While there are some individuals in the ADOS movement who are excessively concerned with immigration policy, the majority are concerned primarily with reparations specifically for the ADOS community. ADOS has a unique claim on the US government just as the former British colonies in CARICOM have a unique claim on the UK, and the Congo has a unique claim on Belgium.” The tumultuous events of 2020 which spawned the blacklivesmatter movement have added another edge to the debate. Can a newly arrived immigrant from Africa with a well-paying job and university education have the same problem with structural racism as a minimum-wage blue-collar ADOS? The idea of growing up somewhere, compared to relocating, is vastly different, as ADOS founder Antonio Moore hasexpressedwith feeling.“The audacity that it takes to come to a post- Cosby Show America for less than a lifetime and feel the right to interject half-baked opinions about American black life is something I still can’t understand.” Think your friends would be interested?

"2 Jan, 2021","Joe Rogan vs. Spotify, reporters reliving ‘Trump Years,’ Twitter casting movies: 2021 predictions for mainstream media & Hollywood","Social justice warriors and their wokedom religion only became stronger in 2020, and it may get even worse in 2021 thanks to self-congratulating reporters, a frightened Hollywood, and shifting goal posts. Zachary Leeman is a US-based journalist and author of the novelNigh. If you think Joe Biden entering the White House and a Covid-19 vaccine will return the world to some vague sense of normalcy in 2021, you haven’t been paying attention. Cultural divides have only grown sharper in 2020, partly fueled by a heated and contested presidential election and virtue-signaling stemming from Covid-19 on both sides of the political aisle. Meanwhile, wokedom has quietly grown, claiming new victims this year and promising more cultural battles and changes to come in 2021. Here are some predictions for what exactly some of those could look like... If you want a look at what the mainstream media will be in a post-Trump presidency world, look no further than CNN’s ‘Reliable Sources.’ On last Sunday’s show, host Brian Stelter invited six“CNNers,”including constant Trump critics Jake Tapper, Jim Acosta, and Daniel Dale, onto his show to reminisce about what it was like to survive the“Trump years.”Listening to the ‘journos’ talk about their battle to call out the“lies”of the president and other White House officials, the conversation had the feel of war veterans gathering to discuss their time in the trenches together, fighting for their flag. “Donald Trump, because of his disruptions and the way he disrupted just how presidents and public figures behave, and his actions too, changed the way that the news media at large behaves,” says CNN’s@jaketapper.pic.twitter.com/JoZTswnUQY These ‘brave’ souls patting each other on the back for nearly an hour is exactly what mainstream media/panel discussions will be in 2021: journalists reminding the world of their victory over Trump and virtue signaling to the most extreme base on the left, practically begging to be thanked for their service. Have you shown appreciation for your local liberal advoca, ahem, journalist yet? The worst thing any of these people faced over the past four years was a delayed Starbucks order but here comes Brian Stelter and his group therapy session. Fox’s ‘Family Guy’ has managed to toe an impressive line for nearly two decades now. The series has pushed irreverent, politically incorrect humor while never getting the heat and chants of ‘shame’ that come from the woke mob anytime an animatedserieslike ‘South Park’ decides to poke fun at the whole world, liberals included. ‘Family Guy’ has managed to do this by constantly earning its liberal bona fides by making sure conservatives are always on their list of safe targets. Despite this, however, the cartoon has a dark, dark secret, one that could be weaponized against it should it ever cross the line in an increasingly triggered world: they gave mean, old conservatives a platform. Trump supporter James Woods has appeared in multiple episodes of the series and is a staple among fans (though he’s been MIA for a few years now), and Rush Limbaugh got to sell himself to a younger generation in anepisodethat was almost an advertisement for his radio show (he also appeared in one of the show’s famous ‘Star Wars’ parodies). In a culture where the standards for words and behavior is growing increasingly extreme, ‘Family Guy’ is going to have a more and more difficult time existing. A recent episode even won some praise from conservatives forpoking funat the extent political correctness has gone, with patriarch Peter Griffin trying to make a gender inclusive nativity scene. While the segment pushed back against extreme transgender ideology, it finished up with Griffin taking a dig at himself for being“white,”therefore saving the show once again from the pitchforks of liberals. But how long can they pull that hat trick off? These days, even speaking to someone deemed ‘hateful’ for their conservative viewpoints can earn one a wave of pushback (see: Alex Jones on Joe Rogan’spodcast), so how long before ‘Family Guy’ tells the wrong joke and its past comes back to haunt it? 2020 saw episodes of television shows like ‘It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’ and ‘The Office’censoredafter being deemed too controversial for today’s climate. Add to thattrigger warningson classic comedies like ‘Blazing Saddles,’ and the cultural wave of blacklivesmatter swallowing shows like ‘COPs’ and ‘Live PD,’ and the targeting of a long-running series like ‘Family Guy’ seems the only logical next step to feed the increasingly hungry woke wolves. Movies were basically canceled in 2020 withmost theatersclosing their doors, and many of the year’s biggest releases dumped onto streaming services or pushed to an uncertain future. However, one trend that caught fire in 2020, and seems to only be getting stronger, is in the area of casting. Halle Berry ducked out on a gig playing a transgender character after ‘misgendering’ during an interview, and Shia Labeouf continues to be accused of ‘brownface’ for a role in ‘The Tax Collector’ where he plays a white gangsterbasedon multiple real people. Don’t let facts get in the way of a good narrative though. The latest casting controversy comes from the series ‘The Stand,’ whichhireda non-deaf actor to play a deaf-mute character. Hollywood insiders and deaf activists have promoted boycotts of the show over the casting decision (the mute thing is irrelevant, apparently), and CBS has responded by actually meeting with activists. This meeting and other bowing-down responses to woke mobs who can’t wrap their heads around the idea of acting is only empowering the woke mob, and they will get more than blood in 2021. While the only way to truly please this crowd would be for acting to simply be retired and people to only play themselves, it’s more likely consultants or advisory panels of social justice warriors with degrees that cost six figures will be let into the casting and pre-production process of film and television projects and force actors playing certain roles to be able to fit a certain number of ‘victim’ boxes that way they can prove that they too, like any good liberal, belong to enough victim classes to be able to do their job without bias. Joe Rogan has remained relatively unfazed by well-documented internal protests at Spotify over a $100 million contract the comedian and podcaster signed earlier this year. The outrage stems from all the usual places: he’s white, he’s straight, he doesn’t blindly buy into every transgender narrative, and he has conservatives like Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones on his program. Rogan has said whatever pressure employees are putting on the company has not affected the content of his podcast, though some fans questioned certain episodes, including ones with Jones, being delayed in their move over to Spotify. Rogan officially moves exclusively to Spotify on January 1, and that will be the true test of his willingness to stay with the streaming giant. Once he’s exclusively platformed though one place, it can give activists within the company more power to protest or push back against an episode containing, say, Alex Jones or any of a number of Trump supporters, who will surely find trouble getting platformed going forward. Rogan had a successful podcast long before Spotify came along and he’s made clear he refuses to change his content for anyone. It’s only a matter of time before he realizes someone labeled ‘right-wing’ like him can only survive in the mainstream by being on the defensive, and anyone who listens to Rogan knows he’s no fan of defending himself. The truth is Rogan can go solo and create a podcasting platform himself to match Spotify’s. Their other attempts at expensive podcasts include one from Michelle Obama and another from Prince Harry Meghan Markle. Think those will be enough to keep their podcasting experiment alive if Rogan decides to jump ship? Considering the amount of zaniness and pot that’s passed around when Rogan invites his most controversial guest and friend Alex Jones on, perhaps a political ‘Cheech & Chong’ style show is in order from the duo in 2021. Name five 2020 performances that are, without a doubt, worthy of a best performance nomination. Go ahead. The truth is the average person likely hasn’t consumed a whole lot of new films in 2020 thanks in part to theaters shuttering, as well as the fact that celebrities have spent the majority of their time praising the performances of liberal politicians, rather than their artistic peers. Think Biden winning an Oscar is far-fetched? Is there anyone you can think of who would be at the ceremony who would object? Plus, another politician won a major entertainment award this year: Andrew Cuomo. His“creative”output was apparently his press conferences which the Emmy Awards found to be“calming”during the pandemic. Forget controversies about nursing homes, sexual harassment, and lockdowns destroying businesses and just drink in the wondrousness of this sentence: Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York,wonan Emmy Award in 2020. Biden being given gold by his Hollywood worshippers doesn’t seem so crazy now, does it? Perhaps they’ll start with a Golden Globe and work their way up in the name of fairness though.

"31 Dec, 2020",Top 10 ANTI-WOKE media heroes of 2020,"In RT’s The Wokies series, we’ve honored the professional MSM moaners who spent much of 2020 lecturing their audience on the finer points of woke doctrine. Now we recognize the journalists and pundits who refused to bow down. Race riots, a presidential election, and a global pandemic gave the media plenty to report about in 2020, but also plenty to virtue-signal about and pontificate on. Andpontificate they did. After a year in which woke wackiness went mainstream and social justice replaced actual justice, RT’s The Wokies honors the few who pushed back, or simply held onto their common sense. “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act,” reads a famous quote sometimes attributed to George Orwell. Suzanne Moore probably didn’t think of herself as a revolutionary when shewrotein March, “Sex is not a feeling. Female is a biological classification that applies to all living species. If you produce large immobile gametes, you are female.” But to trans activists, she may as well have tossed a Molotov cocktail. Moore’s piece appeared in the Guardian – usually a soapbox for the wokest of the woke – and was met with a public letter of attack signed by the Green Party’s co-leader Siân Berry, Members of Parliament Zarah Sultana and Nadia Whittome, UK Black Pride founder Lady Phyll, and Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK. Others were less restrained, with some issuing death and rape threats to Moore and her children. Even 338 so-called journalists at the Guardian complained to their editor about Ms. Moore’s nasty words, and Moore parted ways with the liberal paper. Well done, journalists. The notion that journalists should hold the powerful accountable and speak out against tyranny and corruption on both sides of the political aisle is one lost on many reporters, whether they’re parroting spy agencypropagandato get one over on Donald Trump, or ignoring the misdeeds of Democrats to aid his removal from office. Glenn Greenwald, however, has not gone down this route. As journalists of all stripes jumped aboard the ‘Orange Man Bad’ bandwagon, Greenwald stayed principled, calling out the ‘Russiagate’ investigation as bogus, the modern left for cosying up to the censorious tech titans, and even his former news outlet,The Intercept, for laundering news in favor of Joe Biden. Needless to say, Greenwald’s liberal counterparts aren’t happy, and spent much of 2020 accusing him of cosying up to Trump, and by extension Russia – flogging exactly the same dead horse for which Greenwald regularly ridicules them. The legacy media’s continued beclowning of itself offers little to viewers and readers looking for original thought and analysis. Against this, a new ecosystem of bloggers, podcasters, and Twitter s**tposters has sprung up to fill the void. Leftists tired of identity politics and lectures on the inherentracism of gardeningare tuning in to ‘Red Scare,’ an American podcast presented by Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova – two commentators unafraid to shred the pieties of their own side. Right-wingers looking for something beyond the network of college-Republican grifters are seeking out Bronze Age Pervert’s thunderingsermonsagainst modernity and liberalism, peppered with 4chan lingo and philosophical musings. Meanwhile, cynics of all persuasions are reading Niccolo Soldo’s Substackblog, in which the Croatian contrarian brutally scrutinizes US foreign policy and rails against the neoliberal consensus. Or you could just re-read the1619 Projectagain, if Pulitzer-winning propaganda is more your thing. We talked to Mark Crispin Miller, the NYU professor suing his colleagues for libel over a classroom masking controversy, about covid heresy, academic freedom, conspiracy theories, Edward Bernays, and the changing face of propaganda in the internet agehttps://t.co/A8UlR2oKPB Anyone can use their social media platform to rant, rave, and condemn the mainstream wokescolds and their agenda, but few have had the impact of Christopher Rufo. A researcher and writer, Rufo began exposing the content of ‘Critical Race Theory’ seminars on Twitter this summer, revealing in detail how federal agencies and megacorporations pay ‘diversity consultants’ to lecture their white employees on their inherent white supremacy, their “unconscious biases,” and their need to renounce their “white privilege” while simultaneously “owning their racism.” Rufo’s research led President Donald Trump to ban these ideological struggle sessions from government departments by executive order, and threaten to pull funding from schools teaching Critical Race Theory. On taking office, Biden has vowed to reverse Trump’s ban. Rufo, meanwhile, has promised to filelawsuits, telling the practitioners of Critical Race Theory to “buckle up.” Earlier this summer, a group of 150 academics, journalists and public figures put their names to aletterpublished in Harper’s Magazine, in which they publicly condemned the creeping “ideological conformity” of the left. The letter triggered a storm of controversy, with the most hysterical woke activists complaining they felt “less safe” around its signatories afterwards, and a group of these social justice-minded figures coming together to declare the Harper’s gang “racist” in theirown missive. However, the letter wasn’t exactly the hammer blow against the woke left its signatories would have you believe. It opened with some perfunctory lines condemning Donald Trump and praising the blacklivesmatter movement, was signed by figures like JK Rowling who’ve attempted to “cancel” their opponents before, andexcludedsome potential names deemed too controversial. A little victory at most, but in this woke world, we get the heroes we deserve. Name one TV host so controversial that a mere appearance on his show is grounds for a good old-fashioned canceling. Yep, it’s Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. Carlson spent 2020 excoriating blacklivesmatter , the woke “mob” and their supporters in politics, big tech and the journalists cheerleading its censorship efforts, and the “DC elites” who pushed the “defective”Joe Bidenacross the finish line and into the presidency. Carlson has also bucked the corporate-friendly conservatism of his Fox News colleagues, praising Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren’s economic plan, and hosting left-wing guests such as Glenn Greenwald and socialist professor Cornel West. Liberals have called Carlson’s prime-time show “the white power hour,” but the average American clearly disagrees with the hysterics: ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ broke all records this July to become the highest-rated program in cable news history. Andrew Doyle is a comedian and self-described “anti-woke” columnist with Spiked – a description that by itself doesn’t raise many eyebrows. However, Doyle’s single greatest contribution to the anti-woke cause has been the creation of Titania McGrath, a parody Twitter account that satirizes the modern left’s worst excesses with such skill that it’s often impossible to tell Titania’s posts from those of the most committed social justice warriors. Indeed, McGrath’s satirical comments are so perfectly on the nose that they’ve tricked conservatives and, in some cases, foreshadowed actual articles in mainstream outlets. When Doyle, via McGrath, called Helen Keller out last year on her “staggering” levels of white privilege, he likely had no idea that Time Magazine would agree a year later,writing this monththat, to some black activists, Keller, despite disabilities, was “just another privileged white person.” Like the Harper’s signatories, Matt Yglesias would not be included here had wokeness not completely jumped the shark in 2020. A progressive, and the co-founder of Vox, Matt parted ways with the liberal news site in November, joining Greenwald and some of the new alternative pundits blogging on Substack instead. Though a liberal, Yglesiaswrotethat he divorced himself from the “college grad bubble” of the modern left media – which pushes non-starter ideas such as defunding the police and making the word “Latinx” a thing – to focus on genuine, non-woke issues. Predictably, Substack itself was soon declared racist by mainstream pundits. Another left-leaning journalist to pack it in and head for Substack this year was Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi. Making the move in April, Taibbi criticized the “left leaning” news outlets in the US for leaning “not really ‘left’ but ‘aligned with the democraticparty .’” Since then, Taibbi has continued to expose wrongdoing on both sides of the political divide, as well as negligence and sycophancy by the press, in particular, the liberal media peddlingintelligence-agency hokumin the name of ‘Russiagate’. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone is publishingarticleson the ethical minefield that is living with Trump supporters. When blacklivesmatter rioters took to the streets after the killing of George Floyd in May, the mainstream media was determined to present the lawlessness in as positive a light as possible. Some unintentionallyhilariousmoments ensued, such as CNN’sdescriptionof a burningMinneapolisas “fiery, but mostly peaceful,” and MSNBC’s explanation of the unrest as “not, generally speaking, unruly.” The rioting soon spread, and when Antifa groups joined in, the media remained keen to downplay the violence consuming cities such as Portland and Seattle. On the ground, however, streamers like Elijah Schaffer, Maria Viti, Kalen D’Almeida and RT’s own Sophia Narwitz captured raw footage that rendered mainstream reporting irrelevant, biased, and false.

"31 Dec, 2020",Black man tests positive for Covid-19 after being wrongfully detained by maskless Virginia police officer in viral video,"A black man has tested positive for Covid-19 soon after a maskless white officer mistakenly detained him at a mall in Virginia, his fiancee has said. Police previously apologized and admitted the officer had broken Covid-19 rules. Jamar Mackey got tested three days after the altercation with a maskless officer, and the positive result arrived on Christmas Eve, the man’s fiancee, Shantel Covil, told local news channel WAVY-TV. “I’m very angry that they put my family at risk. Me and Jamar, that’s one thing. But our kids, that’s what upsets me the most,”Covil said. They arrested him, of course, no gloves, no masks. They took us out of our bubble, out of our safe space… We are around each other all the time. Covil said Mackey has gone into quarantine with mild symptoms, including a“low grade fever, a cough, and a sore throat.” It is not clear how and when he was infected. The man wrongfully detained by@vbpd, Jamar Mackey, has tested positive for#coronavirusper his fiancé. Mackey has mild symptoms. We are waiting to hear from@vbpd.pic.twitter.com/EPoh8RH9CA Mackey was handcuffed and briefly detained while having lunch with Covil, their 13-year-old-son, and a baby in the mall food court in Virginia Beach, Virginia on December 19. The officer was not wearing a mask when he detained Mackey, who had a mask, and escorted him to the parking lot. The video of the incident has since gone viral. The officer did not initially explain to Mackey why he was being apprehended.“I want to talk to you, OK?”he said after approaching Mackey in the mall. The man repeatedly asked the officer to state what was going on, to which he replied,“Listen I’m gonna explain all of this,”and continued to escort Mackey out of the mall. The officer mentioned they were looking for a man who drove a black truck.“Y’all got the wrong person. We don t even have a black truck,”Mackey replied. On the parking lot, they were approached by another officer who suggested that they must have had detained the“wrong”person. Mackey was released shortly afterward. The officer then told Covil that Mackey matched the description of a man who had used stolen credit cards.“I sincerely apologize. It was a complete misunderstanding,”the officer said in the video. “This ain’t the f**king ‘70s! It’s 2020! That’s what we march for! That’s why we say ‘ blacklivesmatter !’”Mackey angrily shouted at the officers.“Look how y’all treating us! Y’all see why we fight!” “You have a right to be upset, sir,”the officer said. Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate apologized to Mackey and his family two days after the incident. He promised the issue of the officer not wearing a mask would be“addressed”in an internal review. “We are required to wear masks. We set the standard, we set an example for our community,”the police chief said. The Virginia Beach Police Department could not say if the officer involved in the incident had Covid-19, due to health privacy laws, TV channel WVEC reported. Think your friends would be interested?

"30 Dec, 2020",Nearly 40 percent believe ‘DEEP STATE’ is working to undermine President Donald Trump – poll,"A new poll shows that more than one in three Americans believe a “deep state” is working to undermine the president and remove him from office. The survey also found a majority concerned with the spread of false information. Trump’s legal efforts to overturn the election results may not be gaining much momentum in courts, but there is a significant portion of Americans who doubt the election results. According to a newpollfrom NPR/Ipsos, 39 percent believe there is a“deep state”working to undermine the president. A majority of respondents, however, accept the results of the presidential election (69 percent) and want to see a peaceful transition of power on January 20 (70 percent). The survey also found that 73 percent of respondents are concerned about political violence over the next four years, and 83 percent are worried about the spread of false information, especially when it comes to Covid-19 and vaccines. In a“knowledge test”given to respondents, the poll revealed more of a fractured political culture than anything else. The results for one statement about blacklivesmatter , for instance, was used by the publishers to show a large portion of people (47 percent) buying into what pollsters considered a ‘false narrative’. Told the majority of blacklivesmatter protests were violent over the summer,“just 38 percent correctly indicated that this is a false statement.” The statement is difficult to quantify as the protests are still so fresh and there’s no clarification on what constitutes violence or if it needs to be perpetrated by the actual protesters or others, but numerous blacklivesmatter protests descended into property damage and violence over the summer. Another statement saying,“A group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media”was identified by 47 percent of respondents as false, while 17 percent said it was true, and another 37 percent answered that they were unsure. The Ipsos poll was conducted earlier this month among 1,115 adults. Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"30 Dec, 2020",Scholarship in the age of wokeness: Top 10 ACADEMIC targets of cancel culture in 2020,"This year, attempts to defenestrate people for voicing their opinions reached new heights of absurdity. And academia was no exception. This list comprises the top 10 academic targets of cancel culture, as selected by yours truly. ByNoah Carl, an independent researcher based in the UK. Follow him on Twitter@NoahCarl90 Academics are supposed to be engaged in the disinterested pursuit of truth. And universities are meant to be places where you attack the argument, not the man. But in recent years, many scholars in the English-speaking world have found themselves embroiled in controversies just for expressing an unorthodox opinion or – in one case – pronouncing a Chinese word correctly. The individuals below were all targeted for cancellation in 2020. Some were investigated by their employers, others lost book contracts, speaking engagements and even university positions. On June 2, Professor Gordon Klein (who has taught at UCLA for 39 years) received anemailfrom one of his students calling for“leniency with black students”in light of recent“traumas.”Herepliedby asking, rhetorically, how he could identify the black students (given that classes had been online) and whether he should give mixed-race students a full concession or only half. He also suggested that the student’s request would violate Martin Luther King’s maxim not to judge people by the color of their skin. Later that day, apetitionwas launched demanding Klein’s termination, based on his“woefully racist response”to the student’s email. (It eventually garnered more than 20,000 signatures.) The university put Klein onleavewhile it ‘investigated’ the incident, but he was subsequently reinstated. In a series oftweetsposted on June 8, Professor Harald Uhlig compared blacklivesmatter activists who support Defund the Police to“flat-earthers and creationists.”The next day, apetitionwas launched calling for Uhlig’s resignation as editor of the Journal of Political Economy. ItaccusedUhlig of“trivializing the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) movement”and marginalizing“people of color and their allies in the economics profession.”Then on June 11, one of Uhlig’s former students – who is black –claimedthat Uhlig had belittled him in class six years earlier. Uhlig’s employer, the University of Chicago, looked into the matter, butfoundno basis for further investigation. However, the Chicago Fed severed itstieswith Uhlig, noting that his views are not compatible with the bank’s“commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.” Professor Bruce Gilley has been a wantedmanever since he published his article ‘The Case for Colonialism’ in 2017. The latest attempt to cancel him came on September 26 when a petition was launched calling for the termination of his new book series, ‘Problems of Anti-Colonialism’. (The petition’s organiser, incidentally,describesthe Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada as an“organization I support and promote.”) Three days later, Gilley received notice from his publisher that the petition had achieved its aim. The embattled professor then came out fighting: he shared letters from distinguished colleagues criticizing the publisher’s capitulation; andannouncedin the Wall Street Journal that“this sort of publicity is hard to buy.”Although the publisher refused to backpedal, Gilley managed to find a newhomefor his book series. A respected scholar of women’s history and former president of the Socialist Educational Association, Professor Selina Todd is an unlikely victim of cancel culture. But in 2020, if your views aren’t 100 percent in line with prevailing orthodoxy, you’re not exempt from cancellation. Back in February, Todd was disinvited from the 50th anniversary of the National Women s Liberation Conference (an event that she herself hadhelpedto organize) under pressure from trans activists. The activists, who threatened to boycott the event unless Todd’s invitation was withdrawn, objected to her involvement with the organization Woman’s Place UK, which has been described as a“trans-exclusionist hate group.”However, Toddrefutedthe allegation that she is“transphobic,”and said that some groups of people“just refuse to engage in civilized debate."" On July 21, Professor Lawrence Mead published anarticlein the journal Society, whicharguedthat higher poverty rates among blacks and Hispanics are due to culture, not discrimination. Three days later, the article came to the attention of Twitter activists, one of whomsaid,“F*** WHOMEVER ALLOWED THIS TO GET PUBLISHED!”Two petitions were then launched. According to one, which eventually garnered 3,510 signatures, Mead’s article expressed“racially violent narratives directed at the Black and Latina/o/X community.”Next, Mead was denounced by his own university, and separately by the directors of ten poverty research centers. On July 31, his article was retracted. Mead, however, refused to back down. In a statement to Campus Reform, he maintained,“There is no evidence”that serious multigenerational poverty is caused by racism. Back in December of 2019, graduate student Nathan Cofnas published apapertitled ‘Research on group differences in intelligence: A defense of free inquiry’ in the journal Philosophical Psychology. On January 20, the paper came underattackfrom academic activists. One individual (who has since earned thenickname‘Mafia Mark’) told Cofnas,“You’re about to learn why people generally avoid f***ing with me,”and called for a boycott of Philosophical Psychology. Whenaskedwhether he was physically threatening Cofnas, the academic in question (who later received a lavish grant to study ‘intellectual humility’) clarified,“Nah, just ruin his reputation permanently and deservedly.”That same individual then launched apetitiondemanding an“apology, retraction, or resignation”from the journal editors, but it was unsuccessful. Professor Stephen Hsu had served as senior vice president for research and innovation at Michigan State University for eight years. In a series oftweetsposted on June 10, the MSU Graduate Employees Union called for his removal, describing him as a“scientific racist and eugenicist.”Twopetitionswere launched, one of which was signed by a large number of Hsu’s colleagues at MSU. (Both petitions emphasised the university’s“commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion”.) Hsurebuttedthe accusations against him on his blog, and sharedlettersfrom various academics offering comprehensive rebuttals of their own. There was also a counter-petition, which was eventually signed by 2,466 people. But these efforts were to no avail. On June 19, MSU’s president asked Hsu to resign. The troublestartedfor Dr. Bo Winegard when he was invited to give a talk on human biological variation at the University of Alabama. During the Q&A, Winegard was accused of ‘racism’ for suggesting that genes might contribute to psychological differences between populations. Two weeks later, the academics who had invited him (and who had approved his talk) issued an embarrassingapology, describing his views as“non-scientific.”Winegard was subsequently called for a meeting with his bosses, and told to be more“strategic”in the future. Next, an anonymous activist began emailing his colleagues with links to supposedly offensive material he had written. This prompted another meeting, which was apparently“less congenial”than the first. A few days after Winegard published anotherpaperon human biological variation, he was informed that his contract would not be renewed. On March 24, Professor Norman Wang published apaperin the Journal of the American Heart Association, whicharguedagainst the use of affirmative action in medical school admissions. On August 2, it came to the attention of Twitter activists, one of whomsaid,“Rise up, colleagues! The fact that this is published in ‘our’ journal should both enrage & activate all of us.”Over the next few days, Wang’s paper was denounced by: the journal’s editor; the American Heart Association itself (twice); the president of the American Heart Association; and the American Association of Medical Colleges. On August 6, the paper was retracted. To add insult to injury, Wang was removed as director of the Electrophysiology Fellowship Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The single most ridiculous cancellation of 2020 involved Professor Greg Patton at the University of Southern California. On August 20, Patton – an expert in communication – was giving an online seminar about the use of pause or filler words (like ‘umm’ and ‘err’). He noted that Chinese speakers use ‘that’ as a filler word, which is pronounced ‘nega’. As Pattonsaid,“so in China it might be ‘nega, nega, nega, nega.’”However, because ‘nega’ sounds similar to a racial slur, a group of students complained. In aletterto the dean, they described Patton’s use of the term as“hurtful,”adding,“We should not be made to fight for our sense of peace and mental well-being.”Patton was then suspended from teaching the course. A leakedreportsubsequently revealed that his colleagues felt“betrayed”and were“scared of students.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"30 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top 10 ART WORLD dumpster fires of 2020,"Instead of contributing some semblance of balance and sanity to the weird woke world we have inherited, artists have jumped on the social justice bandwagon with reckless abandon, lending credence to many crazy ideas. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Here they are, the outrageous masterpieces of woke culture that contaminated the art world in 2020. One public monument that won’t be torn down anytime soon by the woke mob is the sculpture ‘Medusa With the Head of Perseus,’ which depicts the snake-haired Gorgon clutching the severed head of the Greek god. Created by artist Luciano Garbati on behalf of the #MeToo movement, the Medusa faces the Manhattan Supreme Court, where Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was sent to prison for sexually assaulting a bevy of actresses and other female staff. What began as a laudable idea – calling out sexual predators lurking inside of the film industry – the #MeToo movement snowballed into a media-hyped inquisition where dozens of famous men had their lives and careers ruined over nothing more than the rumor of sexual impropriety. Although some of the accused certainly deserved public condemnation, and worse,othersarguably did not.  One consequence of the so-called ‘Weinstein Effect’ is that men are becoming more guarded inside of their male-dominated industries, and“more reluctant”about hiring a female, Forbesreported. At the same time, it has raised the glass ceiling for women by several feet. Regrettably, Garbati’s poorly conceived Medusa would better serve as a tombstone for the ill-fated #MeToo movement as opposed to the clarion call it was intended to be. To continue with the delightful decapitation theme, a painting was unveiled this year on Instagram that gave new meaning to the term ‘controversial.’ More shocking than the picture itself, which featured two obese black women holding the severed heads of a white man and woman, was the fact that the popular social media platformfailedto censor it. In fact, it defended the savage imagery by saying“[B]ecause Instagram is a global community, we understand that people may express themselves differently.”Well, that’s certainly a change of tune. By way of thought experiment, imagine what Instagram’s reaction would have been had two obese white women been featured holding … well, you get the idea. Starting in 2017, when the so-called comedian Kathy Griffin posed with a mock-severed head of Donald Trump (which she tweetedagainin November of this year without consequence), and despite Big Tech’s hand wringing over any and all forms of ‘hate speech,’ aggressive forms of ‘artistic expression’ targeting white people seem to be increasingly acceptable. That is a disturbing trend in the art world that should give pale-faced members of the Caucasian tribe some pause. During this summer’s showdown between riot police and blacklivesmatter protesters in Portland, Oregon, the action came to an abrupt halt when ‘Jen,’ an unabashed sex worker, strutted her stuff towards the police line armed with nothing but a knit cap, face mask and her feminine charms. A comical confusion erupted amid the storm troopers, who beat a hasty retreat before the advancing genitalia, and, lo and behold, a star was born. The media was“practically drooling over the literal blank slate they’d been presented with,”observed RT commentator Helen Buyniski on these pages. Strangely, however, theheroineseems to have fallen out of favor with the media overlords. Could her apparent lack of melanin have anything to do with it? At a time when the media-generated script really called for an Aretha, what it got instead was an Athena. That unforgivable oversight screamed between the lines in an opinion piece by Mitchel S. Jackson in the New York Times (‘Who gets to be a ‘Naked Athena’?), where hequestionedthe“weird”motives of the naked (white) protester, as well as that of his predominantly white city.“Portland itself is 77.1 percent white and 5.8 percent Black. That’s why the blacklivesmatter protests there look like they do — white. They have to; that’s who lives there.”By the way, that was no compliment. Jackson wraps up his piece by lamenting that in Portland“whiteness hovers over us Black folk.”In other words, don’t expect the now-famous photo of ‘Naked Athena’ staring down Portland’s finest on behalf of blacklivesmatter to be nominated for a Pulitzer anytime soon. It just does not jive with the times. Just because Britain freed itself from the European Union doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll be seeing the return to good old fashioned British culture and tradition anytime soon, especially on the art scene. That much seems certain by a new tax-funded exhibition, ‘Thirteen Ways of Looking,’ that opened to the public this year. Judging by some of the titles on display, including ‘NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism,’ it is easier to understand a review by fellow RT columnist, Alexander Adams, who speculated that some may get the impression the event was a“work by some comedian gently taking the mickey out of today’s increasingly woke art world.” Alas, however, at a time when humor is the best antidote to these woke times comedy is now viewed as thought crime. Thus, hardcore reality will have to serve as comic relief, which should work just fine considering the sort of art on display. For example, what comedian could outperform a discussion on“Black women as neuroscientists using the domain of the beauty salon as a rebel underground network for a radically new shared system of communication”? Whatever the case may be, British art enthusiasts may soon be required to travel to the Middle East or Central Asia to attend an art exhibition on quintessential British themes, as opposed to those artificially derived from distant shores. Once again, another toxic ‘artivist’ event has landed in jolly old England, this time with the opening of the“queer techno rave and porn”event being held at the once-esteemed Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. To quote the press release,""Queer techno rave INFERNO take over the ICA s Theatre, Bar and Cinema with an all-night programme of music, queer porn and performance art…the first in a series of all-night takeovers from club collectives exploring nightlife as a realm of self-expression.""Can anyone remember the last time a public exercise in“self-expression”did not require latex apparel, chainmail undies, dog whistles and other assorted paraphernalia? But I digress. In deference again to my British colleague, who previously contributed his thoughts on the situation inside of the ICA and other artistic venues in his homeland:“Arts administrators in the UK live in a social milieu where the highest virtue is tolerance, which means boundaries are being ever expanded,”Adams explained.“Rejection of any activity is considered bigotry…[A]s long as the material or activity is anti-West, anti-white, anti-tradition, pro-gay, pro-minority, pro-mass-migration or ""gender non-conforming"" then it will find a welcoming home at the ICA – no matter the quality of art, or whether it can even be called art, or whether it even pretends to be art.”This begs the question, albeit from a non-British observer: is this really the sort of art ‘exhibition’ the British taxpayer wants, needs or deserves? At the very least, would it be asking too much to leave the alcohol-infused proclivities of the night club beyond the purview of the art gallery? Although a visitor to the Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Florida may expect to confront a number of disturbing historical events, they probably would not expect to find amemorialto George Floyd, the African American who was killed by a white cop during an attempted arrest. Yet to express any reservations over Floyd’s inclusion would, to quote RT commentator Micah Curtis, expose that person to a“Kafka trap,”with the ultimate goal of having the individual“incriminate themselves.”Nevertheless, some observations are necessary. First, it is critical to question the media-generated narrative that ‘America is a fundamentally prejudiced country, ravaged by systemic racism.’ It’s a flawed premise, and applying it to the George Floyd case is questionable at best. As far as the tragic death of Floyd goes, it seems more reasonable to suggest that it was brought about not by some sort of neo-Nazi mentality, but rather a severe problem with regards to police tactics. The problem has very little to do with racism per se, although that is not to say there are no racists in US police forces. At the risk of appearing to focus undue attention on the British art scene, it would be hard to ignore what the writer Mark Hudson has dubbed“one of the great cultural events of the pandemic era,”that is, the tossing of a statue toEdward Colston, a Bristol philanthropist and slave trader, into the River Avon. Aside from Colston’s profiting in human flesh as a reason for his statue being destroyed, Hudson relished in the sight of a ‘live performance’ amid the anti-viral lockdown. “It rapidly became evident that virtual gallery tours are a bore and that when you’ve seen one performance of Beethoven’s Fifth played on kazoos from 30 different sitting rooms in the Home Counties simultaneously via Zoom, you’ve seen them all,”he wrote in the Independent. While I can sympathize with Hudson’s exasperation with being cooped up in a flat or house for many days, to suggest that public displays of vandalism now ranks as one of the“great cultural events of the year”suggests something more than sheer boredom is eating away at this man’s brain. At this stage in the woke movement’s relative infancy (and certainly immaturity) the last thing the young vandals need is encouragement. Yes, Colston probably does not deserve to be immortalized in bronze or stone in the public square, but let’s at least be civil and bring the matter of his ejection to a vote. To applaud the mob as it destroys public property simply because the act is ‘live’ only invites far greater acts of destruction down the road, and especially if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues with his very unpopular lockdown regime. News that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had sent members of his police force to stand guard over a massive blacklivesmatter mural painted on a New York City street captures the absurdity of the woke movement like no other. The mayor’s order comes at a time when blacklivesmatter is demanding the defunding of the very police they now want to guard their tax-funded work of graffiti (which de Blasio and his wife helped paint, incidentally). The situation is reminiscent of the situation inside of the protesters’ ill-fated Seattle Autonomous Zone, which saw some of the rabble calling the police when their personal safety was threatened. Would Bill de Blasio, plagued as he is by rising crime rates in the Big Apple, consider sacrificing a single police officer to guard a statue to Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln? Sadly, the answer to that question is all too obvious. Although it would be hard to say which social justice art movement was the most asinine in 2020, Slate magazine’s argument that using famous composers’ last names contributes to an atmosphere of“systematic prejudice, exclusion, sexism, and racism”would certainly be in the running. Writing in the liberal publication, Chris White, an assistant professor of music theory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, apparently stayed awake at night wondering how some composers, like Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart, are recognized by just their last names, while others are not. And yes, the article came with the predictable sermon preaching on the subject of white privilege. Professor White, who must be terribly ashamed of his family name, suggested the public use all those dead composers full names so we can“focus more on their music rather than on the past cultural practices that elevated straight white men at the expense of everyone else."" Sorry Oprah, Madonna, Ellen and Beyonce, looks like the mob will be knocking on your door soon, too. Or then again, maybe not. In keeping with the spirit of the holidays, number one on this woke list must go to the famous Russian ballet, The Nutcracker, which first featured at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1892. Having survived a bumpy ride through history’s ups and downs, the ballet performance found its way to the United States where it has become, as in Russia, an annual Christmas favorite. That is, until the social justice warriors got their claws on it. Asreportedin the Christian Science Monitor, many in the dance community have been wondering“if it is possible to transform ‘The Nutcracker’ to remove its racial stereotypes and aristocratic origins while holding onto its traditional charms.” Exactly what did finicky concertgoers find unacceptable with the perennial classic? Well, for starters,“In Act 2, dancers portraying sweets from different cultures (chocolate from Spain, coffee from Arabia, tea from China) appear onstage. The traditional choreography and costumes – particularly in the Chinese section – reinforced stereotypes that are demeaning and offensive.” Has it suddenly become obscene to associate a race of people with their native costume and food? Apparently so, at least for the very small group of people who look upon such national details not with a sense of pride or honor, but with disfavor. I didn’t think it could get worse, but it does. In another spin off of the original, Sam Pott, the founder and director of Nimbus Dance in Jersey City, actually used a term I never thought I’d hear in the same sentence as ‘The Nutcracker.’ For those already familiar with what triggers the radical progressives, you’ve probably already guessed it. Yes, ‘white supremacy.’ “It was important for European immigrants to have shows like the ‘Nutcracker’ that connected them back to their European traditions,”Potts was quoted as saying by CSM.“But sometimes that was wedded to white supremacy.” Now, in the ‘new and improved’ updated version, a multicultural landscape is presented that shows“the safer and kinder Jersey City of their dreams,”he says. And on that note, I will conclude this list. Thanks to those readers who made it this far. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Here’s hoping for a less angst-driven 2021, when people are less prone to look for problems where there are none. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"29 Dec, 2020","In a year ripe for satire, Netflix’s predictable mockumentary Death to 2020 is proof of comedy’s calamitous demise","2020 has been a brutal year, but one that offers huge potential for humor. However, Death to 2020’s tepid, establishment-friendly take on the past 12 months feels like the final nail in the coffin of true comedy. Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Death to 2020is the new Netflix mockumentary that sets out to humorously sum up the nightmare that was 2020. The film, which premiered on the streaming service on December 27, recounts the actual terrible events of the past year and has fake ‘experts’, played by actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and Lisa Kudrow, as talking heads to comedically comment upon them. The makers ofDeath to 2020, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, are best known in the US for their terrifically terrifying and unnervingly prescient sci-fi horror showBlack Mirror. But UK viewers first got to know them from their more comedy-oriented projects like theWipeseries. Death to 2020is much more like theWipeseries thanBlack Mirror, as it attempts to be a comedy. Unfortunately, it fails in that endeavor. What makesDeath to 2020so irritating is that it has nothing unique to say, and it doesn’t even say the same tired old stuff uniquely. Granted, some of the jokes are mildly amusing, and some of the performances are good. Tracey Ullman as Queen Elizabeth II, Hugh Grant as a stuffy and ornery British historian and Diane Morgan as one of the top five most average people in the world are well done. Others, such as Leslie Jones as a behavioral psychologist and Lisa Kudrow as a conservative spokeswoman, are decidedly not. Ultimately, the film has the comedic heft, impact and staying power of a snide and snarky tweet. At best, it resembles a high-end, star-studded 2020 version of one of those silly Best of the 80s clip shows on VH1. The biggest problem withDeath to 2020, though, is the problem with most comedy nowadays, in that it is such a suffocating, stultifyingly safe and painfully predictable exercise as to be frustrating and fruitless. If you have seen a single monologue in the past year by any of the sanctimonious, self-righteous serfs to the establishment on late night TV, such as Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Bill Maher, Trevor Noah or John Oliver, then you’ve experienced the same impotent comedy ofDeath to 2020. The tired formula of the late-night comedy eunuchs, where they flaccidly recite establishment-approved witticisms devoid of insight and edge, is dutifully replicated here, just in mockumentary form. The result is, not surprisingly, that there’s not an ounce of originality or profundity found in the hour and ten-minute film, which is too long by roughly an hour. Also, clearly lacking fromDeath to 2020is any semblance of comedic testicular fortitude as the usual safe targets are held up for ridicule. Of course, Donald Trump is pilloried because he is a walking punchline, as is clueless Joe Biden, who, amusingly, is referred to both as a “prehistoric concierge” and a “civil war hero.” But obviously none of that is even remotely daring. ‘Karens’, conservatives and anti-lockdown activists are also the butt of many jokes, but the equally golden opportunity to lambaste the illiberal left for laughs is never taken. For instance, the comedy-rich environment of the blacklivesmatter movement is not mocked, and the ‘protestors’ looting and burning businesses in the name of George Floyd don’t get taken to task either. But most telling is that also absent from the comedy firing line are celebrities, like the highly hysterical dopes and dullards who vomited out the repugnantly self-serving ‘Imagine’ and ‘I Take Responsibility’ videos. By ignoring these subjects,Death to 2020reveals itself to be little more than just another pandering video compliantly committed to kissing the right asses and devoutly dedicated to never biting the hand that feeds it. As George Carlin famously oncesaidof the powerful in America, “it’s a big club and you ain’t in it!” But the establishment court jesters who made Death to 2020 either are desperate to become members or are already in the club, as their resolute refusal to challenge the status quo is a perfect representation of the sad state of comedy in 2020. Yes, there are some notable exceptions, Dave Chappelle andBill Burrbeing the most prominent. But beyond that, whether it be Stephen Colbertweepingon air like one of the buffoons he used to belittle, orJimmy Falloncastrating himself with a cowardly apology for an allegedly offensive blackface bit from 20 years ago, or John Oliver’s pathetic pandering to wokeness, or Saturday Night Live’s fierce commitment to anti-comedy or any of the other mainstream comedians who have groveled and genuflected to those who hold the power in our culture, 2020 has been the absolute nadir for contemporary comedy. The bottom line is that 2020 has been a most brutal year that may have changed our world forever, but it is also rife with profound opportunities for humor. Unfortunately for us, 2020 may also have killed comedy, and Death to 2020 is its decidedly unoriginal and unfunny death knell. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"29 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: 2020’s top 10 woke MEDIA moments,"Navigating the politically correct modern world is often a difficult task. Thankfully, we have a hyper-woke media to tell us what’s right and what’s wrong (but mostly what’s wrong). Here’s their greatest hits of 2020. Remember when talk-show hosts made us laugh and journalists reported the news? Those days are long gone, and the mainstream media has since embraced a new, nobler role: to scold, scorn and lecture its viewers and readers until they see the error of their outdated, unwoke ways. Here we honor 10 trailblazing wokescolds who found new and creative ways to talk down to us this year. If it sounds like a riot, looks like a riot, and burns like a riot, is it a riot? Not to CNN, who told its viewers not to trust their lying eyes when rioters set fire to downtown Kenosha, Wisconsin in August. The city was set alight following the police shooting of African American Jacob Blake, and even as CNN’s cameras broadcast live images of the conflagration, the network accompanied the images with a banner describing the protests as“fiery but mostly peaceful.” CNN wasn’t the only network to dabble in PR for rioting mobs. Back in May, MSNBC host Ali Velshidescribedunrest in Minneapolis as“not, generally speaking, unruly,”as protesters behind him gathered in front of a burning building. Despite the insistence of the media, arson and rioting is still considered“unruly”throughout much of the world. If you’ve got an affinity for the outdoors and appreciate the charms of“native”wildflowers, then BBC presenter James Wong has some shocking news for you: you’re racist. Wong – a botanist and presenter on Countryfile – unleashed a fiery tirade against the apparent racism of British gardening culture earlier this month. Terms like“heritage”and“native,”when used to describe plant life, show that gardening has“racism baked into its DNA,”he noted. Wong explained that he was once told by critics that a planting concept he developed“didn’t fit the area,”so therefore, the critics must have been racists. Just don’t tell him about Britain’sproblemswith“invasive non-native species”or its efforts to eradicate Japanese knotweed. He may never recover. As riots consumed the US’ major cities in June, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton (R) penned an op-ed in the New York Times calling on President Trump to do what many on the right were urging him to:“send in the troops.”Liberals raged, and the Times’ editors scrambled to defend their decision to publish it. A day later, however, they flipped, calling its publication a mistake, describing the article as not meeting“our standards,”and pledging to reduce the number of op-eds in the paper permanently. Furthermore, the Times’ journalists complained that the article“put them in danger,”while the actual riots happening in the city at the time, presumably, did not. With the crisis defused, the Times’ editors could go back toadvocatingfor military force in far-away countries and publishing op-eds by less dangerous people, like theTaliban. Amid uncertain and stressful times, laughter is often the best medicine. But if you don’t lean left, or if you voted for Brexit, then you’re the butt of the joke to the BBC. Recentresearchfound that 75 percent of the taxpayer-funded broadcaster’s comedy slots are filled by“anti-Brexit, left-leaning comedians.” These conformist comedians won’t just mock your politics. Sometimes, they’ll even mock you. Take Sue Perkins, a regular on the BBC’s panel shows. Perkins thinks that anyone who voted for Brexitare“headbangers, zealots and quislings.” Way to alienate 52 percent of your audience, Sue! At least the cringe-inducing wokeness of Perkins and her ilk on this list give the rest of us something to laugh at. After a year ofclappingfor frontline healthcare workers and watching hundreds of insufferable ‘dancing nurse’ TikTok videos, talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres dressed up as a Superman-inspired nurse for Halloween to remind us yet again that nurses are amazing, wonderful, selfless, and better than everyoneelse. However, Ellen’s own bedside manner apparently leaves a lot to be desired. Earlier this year she wasslammedfor alleged behind-the-scenes bullying of her staff, and her penchant for insulting“fat”and“stupid”children. Florence Nightingale she ain’t. What is it with ‘Countryfile’ presenters and racism? On top of James Wong’s issues with gardening, presenter Ellie Harrison declared in October that, far from a rural idyll, Britain’s countryside is teeming with bigotry and prejudice. White people, she argued, have dominated Britain’s pastoral lands for too long by their sheer presence, and have driven minorities away with their… gastropubs and hiking trails, or something like that. Whatever the reason, Harrison predicted a“time of reckoning”will soon come for those who dwell there. “Even a single racist event means there is work to do,”Harrison pontificated, seemingly unaware that“single racist events”happen in cities too. Despite the revolutionary zeal of her warning, there’s unlikely to be cross burnings in the Cotswolds or lynchings on the Wicken Fen any time soon. It’s difficult to be despised by all sides of the political spectrum, but ITV’s Piers Morgan manages with aplomb. Morgan is an opponent of Meghan Markle’s“fascist wokery,”but a defender of English footballers taking a knee for ‘ blacklivesmatter .’ He’s been the subject of thousands ofcomplaintsfor alleged racism, yet called Donald Trump“vile”and“repellent”for the tone of his rallies. At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Morgan staked out a position as a staunch supporter of lockdowns, and of stiff penalties for those breaking the rules. Branding those flaunting the restrictions“covidiots,”Morgan was an early advocate of closing pubs and canceling Christmas in an effort to get the virus under control. Therefore he probably shouldn’t have gotten into a taxi without his mask on this month, nor should he have encouraged his son to take part in a crowded blacklivesmatter march this summer. Maybe we’re being covidiots here, but it seems just a little hypocritical, no? Proponents of ‘critical race theory’insistthat there’s a tiny Klansman inside every white person, and demand that whitey pay penance for this original sin. The Los Angeles Times heeded their call this September and laid bare its own shocking, racistpast. Some of the paper’s old views were undeniably controversial – such as its support for the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II. In digging up more recent examples, however, the Times’ editorial board had to get a bit more creative. Its coverage of the 1965 Watts riots won a Pulitzer Prize, but was apparently racist because it was written by a mostly white newsroom. Likewise, the failure of a subsidiary paper aimed at the city’s minority neighborhoods is presented here as an example of the paper’s“deeply rooted… white supremacy,”rather than a business loss. It even, imagine the horror, endorsed a Republican for governor in 1994. Presumably, staff parties will henceforth be replaced with self-flagellation sessions, conducted under the watchful eyes of Robin DiAngelo andIbram X. Kendi. Spanish is a gendered language, and for the scions of wokeness in academia, that’s“problematic.”The solution they cooked up was to replace“Latino”or“Latina”with“Latinx,”in a bid to include gender-nonconforming Latin Americans. Always on the lookout for new ways to signal their progressiveness, liberal journalists jumped at the opportunity to make“Latinx”part of their vocabulary. Vox, the Huffington Post, Vice, and the Daily Beast all switched over to the term in recent months, though seemingly, nobody knows how to pronounce it.“Latin-ex”or“Latinks”?“Latin-*clicking sound*?”Who knows. Also confounding their efforts to make the term mainstream is the fact that Latin Americans, by and large, don’t care for or about it. According to a Pew Research poll in August, only three percent of Latinos and Latinas use the word. 65 percent of respondents told Pew that the term shouldn’t even be used to describe them. The liberal press clearly has work to do to correct their latent white supremacy. For four years, the mainstream media has portrayed Donald Trump as racism incarnate, the white devil himself whose removal from the White House would usher in eternal peace and harmony. Now that that’s apparently about to happen, some pundits still aren’t satisfied. After a mysterious pause in counting and bundles of fresh ballots tipped the needle in Biden’s favor in the days following November 3, the liberal media celebrated the former vice president’s impending victory. However, MSNBC host Joy Reid wanted Americans to be ashamed of themselves for only delivering him a squeaker victory, instead of the landslide he deserved. Biden’s narrow win, she whined, confirmed to her that America has“a great amount of racism, anti-blackness, [and] anti-wokeness.”The fact that the election was so close, she continued,“hurts, it just hurts.” To people like Reid, voters evidently should have cast two ballots for Biden. One to elect him, and one to say sorry for being racist. Ironically, videofootagepurportedly showing multiple ballots for Biden bearing the same signatures being counted has been held up by the Trump campaign as evidence that the election was“rigged”in Biden’s favor.

"29 Dec, 2020",2020 has been a year of classic Boris Johnson buffoonery. Here’s what his bluster really meant,"What with Covid, Brexit, almost dying and becoming a dad again, it’s been a big year for the British PM. Here are the past 12 months in his own verbose words… the very best (or worst) of BoJo in 2020. ByCharlie Stone, author and journalist who has worked for the BBC, several national newspapers in the UK and international media. Boris Johnson is mildly obsessed with Winston Churchill. And they do actually have a fair few things in common. They both went to the poshest of posh English public schools (Churchill to Harrow, Johnson to Eton), they were both journalists famed for their witty turn of phrase, and both have been tenants at 10 Downing Street. Oh, and they were both citizens of the USA. Churchill’s mother was born in Brooklyn and he became America’sfirst honorary citizenin 1963, while BoJo wasbornin New York City and held an American passport until Uncle Sam’s taxman came calling. But that, pretty much, is where the similarities end, although BoJo would dearly love to be seen as an heir to Britain’s great wartime leader and a similar man of destiny. He even wrote a book about his hero,The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, which one reviewer described as“an autobiography of Boris Johnson by Boris Johnson for the promotion of Boris Johnson.” The problem with BoJo is that he’s a peacetime political pygmy, not a wartime giant, and, unlike Churchill, far more prone to pantomime than a Shakespearean soliloquy. So, seeing as us Brits have been denied our traditional Christmas panto this year due to Covid-19, we give you the best – or worst – of Boris’s bluster in 2020 (plus a translation from BoJo babble to English…) 1: ‘Brexit day,’ the day the UK officially ‘left’ the European Union(except not really, as there were still a transitional 11 months to go):January 31. This is a moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama. Translation: Here goes another year of lack of clarity and turmoil, and we still don’t really know what s going to happen, but I just can’t resist spinning a cute little phrase. Is that curtain going up on a classic or a farce? Let’s see how the year unfolds. 2: A press conference about coronavirus:March 3. “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you’ll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.” Translation: I am not taking this seriously and couldn’t be bothered to read my briefing on the virus which, like all viruses, one is advised to avoid catching by not coming too close to other people. Pretty soon I’ll be in intensive care with Covid-19 myself. 3: A press conference advising fellow Brits to stay home if they show coronavirus symptoms:March 12. “The reasons we advise you to do that is really that this will help us delay and flatten the peaks – squash that sombrero – that you saw on the map because that is the way to minimise the suffering and minimise the impact.” Translation: I am looking at a graph that shows a curve in which people will get ill and some will die, yet I simply cannot just use the standard ‘flatten the curve’ term because, well, it looks a bit like a hat to me. I just can’t resist a pithy phrase when it pops into my mind. I’ve been like this since Eton, old chap. 4: On a conference call about making ventilators with British manufacturers:March 17. With the NHS urgently needing 20,000 more ventilators to stop Covid victims drowning in their own phlegm, BoJo jokingly rallied more than 60 companies to join what he called “Operation Last Gasp”to get the job done. When asked later if that was an appropriate phrase, he replied:“I think what I want and what all businesses want, to explain what I was saying, is an end to suffering. And that is why they are [going to be] working incredibly hard in the next few weeks.” Translation: Even when people are going to die, I cannot resist acting like the class clown at my very posh public school. Bugger, I rather shot myself in the foot there. Again. 5: After leaving hospital following a spell in intensive care with Covid-19:April 12. “It’s hard to find the words to express my debt... I want to pay my own thanks to the utterly brilliant doctors, leaders in their fields, men and women – but several of them, for some reason, called Nick – who took some crucial decisions a few days ago for which I will be grateful for the rest of my life.” Translation: A cute little witty phrase doesn’t really seem so cute or witty when you nearly died from Covid-19. But still, I couldn’t resist the ‘Nick’ thing. 6: On becoming a dad again at the age of 55 and helping care for his newborn son, Wilfred, with his partner Carrie Symonds, 32.Wilfred was born onApril 29. According to Boris, his son was“in great shape... I’ve changed a lot of nappies, I want you to know.” Translation: I have been down this road plenty of times before – Wilfred is at least my sixth child, even though he’s Carrie’s first. 7: Defending chief aide and election victory architect Dominic Cummings after he was caught breaking the lockdown rules he helped devise:May 24. In every respect, he has acted responsibly, legally and with integrity. Translation: I am only PM because of Dom (and the fact Jeremy Corbyn was unelectable), plus I’m super-loyal to my favourite chums. But then, in November, silly Dompicked a fightwith Carrie and our dog Dilyn, and he was never going to win that one. Toodlepip, Dom. 8: Responding to reports of attacks on a Winston Churchill statue in Whitehall during a blacklivesmatter protest:June 15. “I will resist with every breath in my body any attempt to remove that statue from Parliament Square... I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or Photoshop the entire cultural landscape. If we start purging the record and removing the images of all but those whose attitudes conform to our own, we are engaged in a great lie, a distortion of our history, like some public figure furtively trying to make themselves look better by editing their own Wikipedia entry.” Translation: Leave my hero alone, you rotters. 9: In a statement to MPs that Covid restrictions could last, well, ages:September 22. “I think everybody in this House wants to see the people of this country and to help the people in this country to obey the law of the land and to get the virus done and that is the objective of this government.” Translation: It is nearly a year since I won the election with the slogan “Get Brexit done”. Now it’s “Get the virus done”. Get it? 10: On news that a vaccine is on the way, but with a warning that Christmas is going to be tough:November 23. “We can hear the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the brow of the hill, but they’re not here yet... It is the season to be jolly, but it’s also the season to be jolly careful, especially with elderly relatives.” Translation: Unlike Churchill, who was a journalist in the Boer War when wars really were still fought on horseback, I have never actually heard this sound other than on films. But one would have to be jolly careful, wouldn’t one? 11: On deadlocked trade deal negotiations with the EU, speaking during a visit to Blyth, Northumberland:December 11. “We’re hopeful progress can be made, but I’ve got to tell you that, from where I stand now, here in Blyth, it is looking very, very likely that we will have to go for a solution that I think would be wonderful for the UK, and we’d be able to do exactly what we want from January. It obviously would be different from what we’d set out to achieve, but I have no doubt this country can get ready and, as I say, come out on World Trade terms.” Translation: Bluster. Piffle and paffle. Plenty people fear it, but not many actually believe that the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal. Pretty much everyone who has followed EU negotiations over the years knows it will come down to the wire and a deal will be done in the end. It’s brinkmanship and all jolly well part of the fun and games. 12: Announcing that a Brexit deal has finally been done:December 24. “We have taken back control of our laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation. And in a way that is complete and unfettered... Happy Christmas to you all. That’s the good news from Brussels – now for the sprouts. Translation: I’m not exactly sure what “jot and tittle” means, but it sounds good. There was always going to be a deal. Did you get the joke about Brussels sprouts, a cornerstone of every Christmas dinner alongside the turkey and gravy? Merry Crimbo, chaps and chapesses!

"28 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: America’s politicians had a busy 2020 virtue-signaling. Here are the top 10,"Amid the pandemic lockdowns, riots and a very controversial election, America’s politicians raced to out-woke each other. From the obscure to the obvious, all listed here pledge allegiance to the flag…of critical social justice. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Here they are, starting on the local level and going all the way up to the top. Minneapolis, Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey simply must be mentioned in any review of performative wokeness in 2020. After the death of George Floyd – an African-American man whose death during a botched arrest was attributed to an officer kneeling on him, rather than Covid-19 or fentanyl present in his system – rioters set a police station and the surrounding block on fire. From there, the riots spread to the neighboring St. Paul and then across America. Frey’s reaction was totake a kneeand wail like a professional mourner at Floyd’s funeral, as if he were best friends with the man. He also tried to join the“protesters”two days later and declare his devotion to social justice, only to bechased offby demonstrators calling on him to resign. He hasn’t been heard from much since. Yet the 13-member city council apparently decided to outdo Frey in public displays of wokeness. Composed of twelve Democrats and one Green, the council first voted to“defund the police”– outright replace the Minneapolis PD with a“reimagined public safety”agency. Except three of them thenhiredprivate security – at taxpayer expense of $4,500 a day – for themselves, saying they had received threats. City council chair Lisa Bender famouslytoldCNN that being able to call the police when your home is being invaded“comes from a place of privilege,”in one of the stupidest statements of 2020. Since then, the council has voted to spend anextra$500,000 to hire new police officers, only to slash the police budget by$8 million– in the name of ‘racial justice’ and ‘equity’ of course. They did so while lamenting the537-percentincrease in carjackings and a 17-percent spike in violent crime in general, as if that was entirely unrelated. For three weeks in June, blacklivesmatter activists and Antifa occupied several blocks of downtown Seattle, declaring it a Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), also known as Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). MayorJenny Durkan, a Democrat, initially insisted it was“not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection”but“a peaceful expression of our community s collective grief and their desire to build a better world.” “We could have the summer of love,”she told CNN. When criticized by President Donald Trump, she shot back:“Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.” Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.https://t.co/o26PkJnYhA CHAZ protesters, meanwhile,stormedCity Hall and demanded Durkan’s resignation. Eventually, they even showed up outside her house – whose location had been kept secret since Durkan’s days as a federal prosecutor. Only then did Mayor Jenny decide that maybe CHAZ wasn’t a summer of love and democracy, and moved to dismantle the shantytown. As it turns out, the CHAZ-ites had an ally inside the citadel all along: Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a self-avowed socialist, whom Mayor Durkanaccusedof opening City Hall to the protesters and organizing the demonstration outside her residence. Sawant actually admitted she“marched, rallied, and organized”with the local community in the name of racial, environmental and economic justice, and accused Durkan of having“utterly failed working people and communities of color in this city.” The city council sided with Sawant,rejectingDurkan’s request to investigate her actions and saying there were more pressing issues demanding their attention, such as“a civil rights movement demanding we divest from racist, anti-Black systems.”To exactly no one’s surprise, a second CHAZ sprung up in early December. While much of the media attention was on Minneapolis and Seattle, the supposedly nonexistent Antifa joined with blacklivesmatter in Portland, Oregon to besiege a federal courthouse and immigration buildings. Mayor Ted Wheeler pulled a Frey and joined the“peaceful protests”in July, only to get thesame reception. When Trump sent federal agents to crack down on the riots, Wheeler denounced the move.“No thanks. We don’t need your politics of division and demagoguery,”he said in an open letter posted on Twitter at the end ofAugust, channeling Seattle’s Durkan.“Your offer to repeat that disaster is a cynical attempt to stoke fear and distract us from the real work of our city.” Within days, however, he wasforcedto move from his condo after“peaceful protesters”tried to set the building onfire, along with nearby businesses owned by African-Americans. Give the man credit for his obstinate consistency, however: even after all that, Wheeler remains a supporter of the blacklivesmatter -Antifa brand of wokeness. Several years ago, Democrat mega-donor and globalist financier George Soros decided to pour millions of dollars into local US politics, specifically elections for district attorneys. People who benefited from his largesse signaled their virtue in 2020 by outright refusing to prosecute rioters or even violent criminals, while throwing the book at ordinary people expressing political dissent. In July, DA Diana Becton of Contra Costa County, California actually charged a couple with a“hate crime”for painting over a blacklivesmatter sign. Becton insisted blacklivesmatter is“an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention.” Some black lives apparently don’t matter to Kim Gardner, Becton’s colleague in St. Louis, Missouri. She ordered the release of everyone involved in the George Floyd riots, which resulted in the death of David Dorn – an African-American retired police captain murdered by looters. Meanwhile, she went after Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a couple who waved a rifle and a handgun to scare off a mob of rioters that barged onto their property. California may be dealing with rolling blackouts, unusually devastating wildfires and mass emigration to other states by people seeking a better life, but that hasn’t stopped Governor Gavin Newsom from pledging allegiance to woke values on an almost daily basis. Citing climate change, which he also blamed for the wildfires, in September Newsom signed a ban on all non-electric cars starting in 2035. This promptedEPAAdministrator Andrew Wheeler to write a scathing letter arguing that the ban“begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet...when you can’t even keep the lights on today.” Newsom was undeterred, proceeding to sign another law that would mandate the state’s prisons to house inmates based on their owngender identity, rather than their sex assigned at birth, prohibiting discrimination based on the inmate’s anatomy. The law is part of California’s“march toward equality”and would help“uphold the dignity”of all state residents, Newsom said. Meanwhile, he has turned all of California into a de facto prison through draconian Covid-19 lockdowns – while exempting himself from the same rules. Whencaughtdining out with lobbyists at the fancy French Laundry restaurant, he shrugged it off by saying he“should have modeled better behavior”and carried on, undisturbed. Lest you think the wokeness is endemic to the Left Coast, there was plenty of it on display in the Big Apple this year as well. Mayor De Blasio was quick to jump on the lockdown train, but abruptly reversed course in June and declared that the virus didn’tapplyto blacklivesmatter protests. Then he personally helped paint blacklivesmatter outside the Trump Tower in an act of“liberating”5th Avenue, as heput it. NYPD was then told to look the other way at crime and guard the sign from peoplesplatteringit with paint instead. Meanwhile, he went after New York City’s OrthodoxJews,singlingthem out for coronavirus lockdown enforcement and condemning theirdefiance. In December, de Blasio ordered the arrest of a Staten Island barownerwho refused his arbitrary orders banning indoor dining. Just a few days later, Hizzoner was on TV talking about schools – which are mostly closed again – and openlydeclaredthat“our mission is to redistribute wealth”during a talk about public schools, arguing it was the only way to deal with“structural racism and segregation.” Hirono (D-Hawaii) is so woke that the Constitution and even the English language can’t contain her. Back in 2018, she famouslyarguedthat Supreme Court nominees don’t have a presumption of innocence because“we’re not in a court of law.”This October, during another SCOTUS nomination, she actually managed to change the dictionary. Mere hours after Hirono made the baffling claim that the term“sexual orientation”was“offensive and outdated,”Merriam-Websteralteredtheir entry to reflect Hirono’s assertion. Now that’s woke! While not a politician as such, the world’s largest museum and research institution complex is funded by the US government. It’s unclear when exactly they decided to endorse the language of critical race theory and intersectional social justice, but this year it was finally noticed. In July, at the peak of the George Floyd riots, a number of people found the ‘Whiteness’ page of the ‘Talking About Race’ series on the website of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture (NMAAHC), part of the Smithsonian Institution. It helpfully explained that self-reliance, nuclear family, the scientific method, delaying gratification, ‘Judeo-Christian tradition’, competitiveness and justice based on protecting property and English common law are all“white”things. The presentation was based on a slide show by corporate consultant Judith H Katz, dating back to the 1990s. Furore over the presentation led to its brief removal from the NMAAHC homepage, and an executiveorderby President Donald Trump in September, banning any sensitivity training that“scapegoated or stereotyped”people on the basis of race, sex or other characteristics. Democrats and diversityconsultantshave urged Joe Biden to rescind the order“on day one.” Not Biden the man, who boasted of authoring the 1994 crime bill and praised KKK Exalted Cyclops Robert Byrd at his funeral – but“Joe Biden”the construct, created by the mainstream media and the Democrat narrative managers as the apotheosis of America’s wokeness. Already woke-adjacent for having been Barack Obama’s wingman for eight years, the 78-year-old white guy from Delaware first burnished his credentials by picking Kamala Harris – or“Indian-Afro-Caribbean Woman Of Color”as the labels go – as his presumptive early replacement. Once the media proclaimed him president-elect, he proceeded to announce a cabinet stacked with“historic firsts”that CNNinsistedamounted to“an administration that looks like and reflects the diversity of America.” Among the“firsts”so far are nominations of African-American men to head Treasury, Defense and EPA, a Native American to head Interior, a Latino as head of Health and Human Services, a“Latino and immigrant”two-fer as head of Homeland Security, and a Hispanic“White House Social Secretary”(we kid you not). Then there are“Women of Color”to be the US Trade Representative and chair the Council of Economic Advisers, while Neera Tanden gets to double-dip and be the“first woman of color and first South Asian American”to run the Office of Management and Budget. Lest we forget, ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen is to be the“first woman as Treasury Secretary.” Proving that he is infinitely more woke than Trump, who only had a woman run the CIA and an openly gay man be the acting Director of National Intelligence,“Biden”nominated a woman to the DNI spot, while CNN breathlessly split hairs to inform America that Pete Buttigieg would be the“first out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary approved by the Senate.” Bright woke future, here we come!

"28 Dec, 2020","Ted Nugent sets off Twitter SJWs with holiday message slamming blacklivesmatter as ‘soulless, stupid & based on lies’","Conservative rocker Ted Nugent appeared on the ‘America This Week’ radio program and made waves by targeting the blacklivesmatter movement, letting out comments that are earning him accusations of racism. Asked by host Eric Bolling on Sunday about athletes like Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the National Anthem and the American flag being “disrespected” at protests across the nation, Nugent made his feelings about blacklivesmatter crystal clear. “I identify those people as being real soulless, real stupid. They don’t even know what they’re doing,”Nugent said of those behind the blacklivesmatter movement. He then targeted the slogan“Hands up, don’t shoot,”a common chant by blacklivesmatter protesters in reference to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. “They claim that somebody’s hands were up, and they got shot. That’s a lie. I know the situation. I’ve studied those situations, and nobody’s hands were up, and nobody got shot. So the entire premise of that so-called protest is based on a lie,”Nugent said. Reports that Brown had been shot in cold blood by police with his hands raised in surrender, based on uncorroborated accounts of events, were proven to befalsein ensuing investigations. “And they can’t be that stupid. They know it’s a lie. They’re just liars. So when you see someone disrespecting our flag, um, they don’t deserve any respect themselves, and they should be ashamed of themselves,”Nugent said. Eric Clapton just called to complain that Ted is giving mediocre racist guitar players a bad name. Nugent, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and a Second Amendment advocate, has been blasted for his blunt comments on the blacklivesmatter movement, which has seen protests across the country become more and more common this year, with some turning to violence. He s been accused by liberal activists on social media of racism, though he never referred to black people when making his comments about blacklivesmatter . Ted Nugent like the other so called MAGA celebrities are irrelevant...once the 🍊🤡 is gone let’s hope they all crawl back into the holes they came out of 4 years ago!

"27 Dec, 2020",‘Did she also celebrate Tupac’s birthday?’ Incredulous internet sleuths take aim at Kamala Harris’ ‘childhood memories’ of Kwanzaa,"Social media users have accused US vice president-elect Kamala Harris of bending the truth after she claimed to have fond memories of celebrating Kwanzaa with her family. Harris released a video message on Saturday in which she wished her supporters a happy Kwanzaa, and said that her own family would be observing the holiday over Zoom. “Our Kwanzaa celebrations are one of my favorite childhood memories. The whole family would gather around across multiple generations and we’d tell stories and light the candles,”she reminisced, as a traditional seven-branched Kwanzaa candle holder was displayed on a table behind her. First celebrated in 1966, Kwanzaa is a pan-African holiday that lasts from December 26 to January 1. Its creator, African Studies professor Maulana Karenga, said the holiday was a way for people of African heritage to“celebrate themselves and their history.”A central figure in the Black Power movement in the US, Karenga himself was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1971, after being found guilty of assaulting and torturing two women. Considering that Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 and Harris was born in 1964, I highly doubt her family “across multiple generations” would have celebrated the holiday.This just comes across as another one of her lame attempts to sound human and in touch with the average voter.https://t.co/mbD895IoRA The vice president-elect, who has mixed Indian-Jamaican ancestry, spent her childhood in California and Montreal, Canada. Social media users immediately pounced on the video message, noting that Harris was born in 1964 in Oakland, California, raising questions about why“multiple generations”of her family would take part in a holiday that hadn’t yet been invented at the time of her birth. “What generations of your family were celebrat[ing] Kwanzaa when you grew up?”askedone suspicious Twitter user. Conservative pundits compared Harris’ comments to a Saturday Night Live sketch, and even left-wing commenters such as Margaret Kimberley, editor of the Black Agenda Report,accusedthe politician of lying about her family traditions. This is funnier than Saturday Night Live in the 90s. 😂 Others shared photographs showing Kamala’s “real” childhood. One picture is of her family in traditional Indian costume, while another photograph documents a family Christmas from 1968. Meanwhile, Kamala s actual childhood:pic.twitter.com/bSXfAZkPSy I found 1, oh wait they are celebrating Christmas!pic.twitter.com/F9pMwJwfEG Given Harris’ background, there was also speculation about why any member of her family would even be interested in Kwanzaa. Her father emigrated to the United States from Jamaica. Although some argued that Kwanzaa is not widely celebrated in Jamaica, the holiday can be observed by all members of the African diaspora. But many still expressed their doubts. “Other holidays that Kamala Harris celebrated with her Tamil Brahmin grandmother in Montreal in the 1970s: Juneteenth, Ramadan, World AIDS Day, The Feast of St. George of Floyd, Tupac Shakur s Birthday,”joked conservative journalist Steve Sailer. Other holidays that Kamala Harris celebrated with her Tamil Brahmin grandmother in Montreal in the 1970s:JuneteenthRamadanWorld AIDS DayThe Feast of St. George of FloydTupac Shakur s Birthday Harris has struggled in the past when trying to connect with African Americans. In a gaffe from September, the California politician declared Tupac to be“the best rapper alive.”The artist had been killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"27 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top-10 BRITISH virtue signalers of 2020 (including a cop and a cleric),"It’s been a great year for a bit of virtue signaling. There s been loads about which to show you REALLY care: blacklivesmatter , statue toppling, the pandemic, pick your poison. Here’s a look at the ten best hits from UK leaders. ByCharlie Stone, author and journalist who has worked for the BBC, several national newspapers in the UK and international media. Trust me. Vote for me. I care. Honestly. I really, really DO care. Virtue signaling for politicians is the modern day equivalent of kissing a baby, downing a pint in a working men s club, going to church or hugging the wife. All for the cameras, of course. Plus it s so very very easy to do. Just take the knee because Black Lives REALLY DO Matter or spout something Woke and with feeling - preferably on social media. You don t actually have to DO much of anything at all and you secretly don t even have to mean it. The definition of virtue signaling is an attempt to show other people that you re a good person. Politicians never want you to think they re a bad person, do they? Here s ten of this year s political best with a cop and a cleric thrown in for good measure: Justin Welby isn t a Catholic, but he has spent an awful lot of his time in the confessional this year. ""I am sorry and ashamed,""the Leader of the Anglican Church said in February.""I m ashamed of our history and I m ashamed of our failure. There is no doubt when we look at our own Church that we are still deeply institutionally racist. “I have white advantage, educational advantage, straight advantage, male advantage … I’m not ashamed of those advantages, I’m ashamed of not knowing I had them.” May I make a suggestion? How about an unconscious bias training course. It only takes a couple of hours, and you ll be cleansed. Just ask Keir Starmer (spoiler alert – he is also on this list). Police officers in uniform should stay clear of making political statements in public. Indeed, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick instructed her officers not to take the knee during protests in London. But Pughsley took the knee at an event in Gravesend, as an act of humility - for the cameras, of course. He cares though, you see, he really really cares:""Our communities can be confident we listen, we work with them to solve problems and we are accountable for the service we provide. We are never complacent and always strive to be better."" Yeah, whatever Alan. Whatever. All of a sudden, in January, an obscure little virus that had first been spotted in a market in an obscure Chinese city called Wuhan was cutting a swathe across the whole globe. For weeks, scientists seemed to know just about as much as the rest of us as it clawed and coughed its way towards every one of us, ie: nothing much at all Barry Gardiner had been socially distancing, like the rest of us, from March. Then something more important came along than the health of himself and his neighbours: he had to join thousands of others and take the knee for a cause. An American black man was killed by a white cop... in America. But, well, blacklivesmatter . Only 48 hours earlier, he d been on the radio saying lockdown needed to be extended. There were others of course, including the MP Tobias Ellwood and broadcaster Piers Morgan, that didn t seem to quite get the hypocrisy. Covid 19 is a virtuous virus though, you see. Spend the day on the beach with your mates and the virus is hitching a ride back home with you on the train to infect everyone within a two metre radius. Take the knee close to thousands of others, however, and the little blighter s receptors know how just your cause is - and they don t attach. Funny that. How George Floyd died was abhorrent to most human beings. Only a racist nut or a true moron would think what that cop did was reasonable. Kneeling on a man s throat for almost nine minutes until he chokes to death is not restraint: it s murder. Plain and simple. Taking the knee began as a protest against the unfair treatment of black Americans, and was made famous by NFL player Colin Kappernick and was picked up by the blacklivesmatter movement after Floyd s death - or, more correctly, after video footage emerged of what happened. One doesn t actually need to take the knee to recognise and accept that what happened to George Floyd was an affront to humanity. But... George Floyd was a black American man killed by a white American cop... in America. It was not within the jurisdiction of any British lawmaker. And it s funny how there is always a camera present at the crucial moment the knee touches the ground. ""Excuse me mate, any nice cafes around here? I m just gagging for a vegan latte!"" "" Course bud. What you wanna do, this time of night, is head down to the bottom of Destiny Road, left onto Inspire Avenue, cross over Respect Way, left onto Equality Road, right onto Diversity Grove and then next left. There s a Woke cafe at the bottom of Humanity Close."" City planners in Birmingham asked locals where 5,000 new homes are being built on the site of the old university campus to come up with some street names, and this non-specific Woke piffle won the day. Say no more. Nadia, my dear, sorry - but you were just too young to become an MP. At 24, you had virtually no life experience whatsoever, and you made it very clear how little you know by the dopey clap-trap you tap into your smartphone. Debate, you see dear, is not a foot in the door for hatred it s a kick in the arse to totalitarianism She tweeted:“We must not fetishise ‘debate’ as though debate is itself an innocuous, neutral act. The very act of debate in these cases is an effective rollback of assumed equality and a foot in the door for doubt and hatred.” Righto Nadia, righto. But debating, err, isn t that actually your new job? Here s a quick lesson, you must have missed this one in school because you were too busy canvassing and putting up posters. Parliament. Like so much of the old stuff in Britain, it began in French. The very word Parliament is derived from the French verb parler - to talk .  Parlez vous français? Vous êtes membre du parlement. These days the Liberal Democrats have enough MPs to field a team in a Parliamentary football match - but only just, and they have no subs if anyone cries off with covid-19. Gone are the glory days when the party held the balance of power with 57 seats and Nick Clegg was kingmaker and deputy PM. Wera Hobhouse is one of those 11 political superstars, and is the party s Justice spokesperson. (Everyone gets a post in the Lid Dems these days, there are more Cabinet equivalent jobs than MPs to fill them.) And Wera s big idea for her tiny, pretty much irrelevant political party? Let s get more people from ethnic minorities into Parliament. Brilliant. Nobody else has ever thought of that one, Wera. The Parliament elected in December 2019 is the most diverse ever. But she wants to go a step further, a step too far. She wants to make it legal to draw up shortlists of candidates that have no white people on them. She tweeted in October.""We cannot hope to beat racial injustice unless the people making decisions genuinely represent our diverse nation."" Here s a suggestion to white, German-born Ms Hobhouse for the new year: give up your own seat to a BAME candidate and hold a by-election. North of the border, and be careful what you say after a little too much mulled wine grandma. As you grumble about a year filled with lockdowns, social distancing and Boris bloody Johnson around the table with the seven other people you re allowed to see on Christmas Day, keep an eye out for anyone writing it all down on a napkin. It won t be a letter to Santa 2021, it ll be evidence for the Justice Department. Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf wants insulting conversations at home between family and friends to be punishable. You d still have the right to be offensive , he said, but“stirring up hatred”against others on the basis of religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity or“variations in sexual characteristics”will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. “Let s just give an example, which is intentionally stirring up hatred against Muslims,”he said.“Are we saying that that is justified because it is in the home?” So? You don t actually have the right to be offensive at all, then? Unless it s offensive to someone who is white, non-religious, straight, not old and not disabled. Then, go ahead - fill yer boots. Got that, grandma? You can still slag off uncle Frank, I ve never seen him in a dress. Have another whisky. It s an unfortunate but statistical fact that a disproportionate amount of violent crime in London is perpetrated by black youths - upon other black youths. But, that simple fact is a political minefield these days for any cop in England s capital city. Stop and search, you see, disproportionately impacts upon... yup, you guessed it, black youths. Of course there must be a racist element to the stats plus you cannot discard the individual idiocy of some very stupid officers. But it s also pretty basic logic, it s pretty basic policing too: try to target the perpetrators. But the number one job of a policeman in Mayor Khan s London is not to actually catch any bad guys or prevent crime, oh no, a cop s number one priority is to put a tick in an ever-lengthening row of boxes. He wants, for example, 40 per cent of new recruits to be of BAME backgrounds by 2022 and he also wants them to be from London itself. That s pretty much only a year away now, let s check in this time next year and see how you re doing with that one, Mayor Khan. That s if you don t get booted out in the Mayoral election in May. Sir Keir, bless him. At heart he s just a stiff and not very exciting lawyer with his Superman hairdo and nice blue suit. The single most interesting thing about Sir Keir is that he s not Jeremy Corbyn. But the new Labour leader s Woke vital statistics were dented in the summer after he described the blacklivesmatter movement as a moment - as in it wouldn t last long. Oops. (He insisted later he d actually meant moment in time , ie: big and important). Something had to be done to repair the damage amongst the perpetually offended. So Sir Keir lifted the proverbial baby out of the pram and gave it a big slobbery kiss, by signing up for a thing called unconscious bias training . That s a course to re-programme prejudiced ways of thinking and assumptions about people because they can unfairly influence decisions, such as who might get a job. ""I think everybody should have unconscious bias training. I think it is important,""he said in July. So the 58-year-old Labour leader purged himself of a lifetime of subliminal bias - hey, it only took a couple of hours - in October, when his spokesman trumpeted that he had passed his unconscious bias training. One has to wonder, though, what does one actually have to do in order to fail? Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"26 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top 10 CORPORATE panderers who plumbed new depths in 2020,"Corporations went headlong into performative wokeness this year, falling over themselves to embody the spirit of diversity and inclusion. They mostly succeeded in alienating customers and bringing down torrents of mockery instead. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram While some companies deliberately set out to become woke standard-bearers, donating conspicuous sums to blacklivesmatter or delivering pompous press releases about their new direction, others were pushed into the PC pit unexpectedly - whether through guilt by association or because a publicity-hungry customer was able to bend the ear of a story-hungry tabloid. Perhaps attempting to distract from the revelation that management knew about the shortcomings in the 737 MAX’s onboard computer that killed hundreds of passengers in two crashes within six months, Boeing was quick to embark on an internal witch hunt as blacklivesmatter took over the sociopolitical discourse this summer, wielding the big stick of cancel culture against its own employees. Communications chief Niel Golightly resigned after just six months with the company over a 33-year-old article he’d written arguing against women serving in the military. While he claimed the piece no longer reflected his views, it was nevertheless“embarrassingly wrong and offensive,”Golightly said - to applause from the CEO, who boasted about the company’s“unrelenting commitment to diversity and inclusion in all itsdimensions.” Boeing’splanesmay still be horrificallyunsafe, but at least doomed passengers can die content that the airplane manufacturer has“zero tolerance for bigotry of any kind.” Not to be outdone by the Americans, top Scandinavian airline SAS let its customers know in February that“nothing is truly Scandinavian.”Releasing a commercial claiming that cultural touchstones from Norway, Sweden and Denmark had actually come from elsewhere and declaring those countries’ residents were “no better than our Viking ancestors” in terms of (metaphorical) pillaging, the company seemed surprised when Scandinavians didn’t take kindly to being told they had no culture of their own. SAS ultimately removed the spot - though not before blaming the backlash on“right-wingers”and“hate groups.” Publishing giant Penguin Random House in partnership with Barnes & Noble planned to celebrate Black History Month in February by changing the races of iconic literary characters for 12 re-released editions of young adult classics - confusing those they were trying to pander to (who asked why thepublisherhadn’t just featured works written by actual black authors) and alienating others with the cheap stunt. At the eleventh hour, the“culturally diverse”book launch wasshelved. Buttermaker Land o’ Lakes quietly removed the illustrated Native American woman“Mia”from its logo in February following a handful of complaints from Native academics and politicians that the demure image was somehow playing into“sexualized depictions of Indigenous women.”But far from getting the plaudits it expected for the woke gesture, the company was deluged with bad reviews by customers who resented its kowtowing to political correctness. The son of the Native artist behind the most recent depictions of“Mia”even penned an op-ed for the Washington Post skewering the brand, noting that Land o’ Lakes in true American fashion had“got[ten] rid of the Indian and kept the land.”Ouch. Following Quaker Foods’ decision to dump its“Aunt Jemima”syrup mascot in June, citing the character’s racist origins in the“mammy”stereotype of black women, other companies whose packaging prominently featured black characters rushed to dispose of them in what some observed was an ironic blow against minority representation. Mars’“Uncle Ben”and the nameless black chef gracing B&G’s Cream of Wheat packages were unceremoniously ushered out the door in Jemima’swake. Indeed, the frenzy to dispose of potentially problematic brand emblems reached such a peak that ConAgra Foods opted to discontinue its Mrs. Butterworth syrup - even though the eponymous Butterworth, represented in the product’s“distinctive motherly-shaped bottle,”was merely intended to“evoke the images of a loving grandmother”and has no race at all. Dessert maker Hansens opted to rename its popular“Eskimo”line of chocolate-covered ice cream pops in July after a Danish politician complained the term“Eskimo”means“eater of raw meat”and“has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders.”They weren’t the first to drop the supposedly offensive term - Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, which had been selling chocolate-covered ice cream“Eskimo Pies”for nearly a century, vowed in June to rename the product and change its marketing campaign, which had featured a little boy dressed in ‘Eskimo’ garb against a snowybackdrop. Hansens was lambasted for bending to political correctness, with tens of thousands of“angry”Facebook reactions to thenews. But competitor Premier, which makes a similar product called“Kaempe Eskimo”(Giant Eskimo), opted to keep its name - and presumably a larger share of the chocolate-covered ice-cream pop market. Corporate groveling reached something of a nadir with UK department store chain Marks & Spencer caving to a single bullying customer upset over the names of the colors it offered for bras. The individual complained M&S was naming darker-colored bra shades less favorably than lighter-colored ones - the dark color was called“tobacco”while lighter colors sported names like“cinnamon”and“fudge.”Initially ignored by M&S, shopper Kusi Kimani went to the UK tabloids, at which point the chain began apologizing profusely and promised to solve this most first-world of first-worldproblems. In a year where small businesses, especially restaurants, are struggling to merely keep their doors open, crowdsourced business-rating platform Yelp opted to empower the worst impulses of petty wokesters with a new“business accused of racist behavior alert.”The feature was quickly embraced by Antifa, which reportedly asked its members to begin reporting“any company that’s hanging blue lives [matter] garbage in their store or anything else that’s anti the [ blacklivesmatter ] movement”in the hope of driving such benighted establishments out of business. The racism-alert feature wasn’t even Yelp’s first foray into performative wokeness for 2020 - that honor goes to its collaboration with“Open to All,”a company that makes virtue-signaling window decals marking an establishment as a bastion of tolerance and diversity-training kits for businesses that can’t afford the tens of thousands of dollars it costs to hire a corporate-credentialed“diversity consultant.” When it comes to instilling woke virtues, the dominant thinking is that you can never start kids too young, and Nickelodeon quickly caught on to the power they wielded regarding control of young children’s worldviews. The cartoon-dominated network ran nearly nine minutes of a black screen flashing“I can’t breathe”in time with the contradictory sound of breathing (with a countdown at the top of the screen, in case anyone wasn’t aware that this was going on for as long as some of the channel’s actual shows). While it’s not clear if they expected their pint-size viewers to be familiar with slain Minneapolis man George Floyd or the amount of time he’d spent under a smirking cop’s knee, they presumably assumed the unusually quiet nine minutes would drive children to ask their parents what had happened to their usual brightly-colored entertainment - at which point the parents would presumably choose between explaining Floyd’s death to their formerly innocent kids or shelling out some kind of donation to woke standard-bearers Color of Change to change the subject. Stock exchange Nasdaq announced last month that companies hoping to remain listed on its authoritative index had better start diversifying their boards of directors, meritocracy bedamned. Submitting a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require companies to include at least one director“who self-identifies as female”and another“who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+,”the exchange raised eyebrows across the financial sector. Nasdaq isn’t the first to prioritize skin-deep diversity over talent or business acumen, either - investment bank Goldman Sachs also declared earlier this year that it would no longer take companies public that didn’t have at least one“diverse”board member, and Credit Suisse recently debuted a new index called“LGBT-350”to encourage investment in companies considered LGBT-friendly places to work. Given the disastrous recession many of the world’s economies have plunged into thanks to government-mandated shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s hard to tell which companies have fallen victim to the longstanding rule of“get woke, go broke.”However, it’s clear many of those with purchasing power are sick of the pandering - and eager to spend their hard-earned cash elsewhere. But with those who set the economic rules - not just Nasdaq, but the entire ESG (environmental, social and governance) financial virtue-signaling apparatus - having embraced the program of all-woke, all the time, it’s not clear if dissatisfied consumers will have any alternatives in the near future. After all, most small businesses are facing certain death at the hands of coronavirus-crazy governments who’d rather“kill ‘em all and let God sort them out”than allow citizens to make their own decisions.

"25 Dec, 2020","RT presents The WOKIES: 2020’s top virtue signalers, ENTERTAINMENT edition","This year has been a bad one for most of us, but woke virtue signalers of every stripe have been having the best of times. To honor them, RT presents The Wokies award chart – and first on stage is the entertainment industry. Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo It is unsurprising that the entertainment industry, which naturally attracts the intellectually vapid, the emotionally insecure and the rabidly self-absorbed, boasted some of the most egregious and aggressive virtue signaling in the history of the art form in 2020. Anyone who has ever waded through the intellectual cesspool of our narcissistic culture is all too familiar with the compulsive public expressions of moral superiority and shameless self-righteousness of entertainment industry wokeness. In 2020, entertainment industry virtue signalers, in a desperate attempt for attention and validation, vomited such copious amounts of their odious, self-serving woke bile into the public sphere that it felt like we were all living in a giant virtue vomitorium. In honor of the worst year in recent memory, I have put together a list of the 10 worst virtue signalers in entertainment for 2020. Enjoy! The NYT’s list of the25 Greatest Actorsof the 21st Century (So Far) and theBest Actors of 2020studiously ignored talent, skill and reality and instead went all in on virtue signaling by including a cavalcade of minority, foreign and elderly actors as well as ridiculous Tik-Tok performers. The final result is a human resources department’s wet dream and looks more like the waiting room at a casting call for a diversity and inclusion public service announcement than a collection of best actors. The home of the famous Golden Bear and Silver Bear Awards announced this year that they were going gender neutral in their acting awards… how very Weimar of them. Next up – Golden and Silver Bears announce their pronouns are they/them and ze/zir. Put a warninglabelon Gone with the Wind so that people knew they were bad for watching it and evil for liking it. Also put out UNpregnant, a zany, whacky, fun-loving teen abortionmovie. So much virtue to signal! Bell had an All-Star caliber virtue signaling year… shequita voice role because she is white, did the ‘I Take Responsibility’ video – the gold standard of the virtue signaling art form, thensaidshe raises her kids anti-racist and doesn’t care about their sexual choices. The Quadruple Crown of virtue signaling! Ask not for whom the virtue signaling Bell tolls… it tolls for all of us! Brody turned the virtue signaling up to 11 this year by being inappropriately amorous with the pedophile starter kit known asCutiesand by ranking Spike Lee’s abysmal and amateurishDa 5 Bloodsas #2 on his ‘Best of the Year’ list. Apparently, Brody doesn’t care if people think he’s a pedophile, but he REALLY doesn’t want people to think he’s racist… now that’s some quality virtue signaling! As evidenced by the insipid woke comedic stylings of Saturday Night Live, Jimmy Fallon’s impotentapologyfor wearing blackface 20 years ago, Stephen Colbert literallycryingabout Trump, and the eunuch brigade of Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver and Trevor Noah going all in on the safest, wokest, establishment-approved comedy imaginable, virtue signaling has spread like a contagion through late night comedy. These flaccid, pandering clowns make Jay Leno seem downright Carlin-esque. Yuck. Disney attached absurdly verbose contentwarningsto some of their classic animated films like Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp and Hulu (which Disney controls) pulled episodes of 30 Rock, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Scrubs, Golden Girls and Community for committing the sin of comedy ‘black face’ in the past. Disney – where adults get treated like children! This year, the NBA emulated the flopping and vacant histrionics of its players by doing an extravagantly exaggerated, dramatically over-the-topembraceof ‘social justice’. In the NBA bubble in Orlando – the Happiest Place on Earth, ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ was painted on every court and players wore trite woke slogans on the back of their jerseys. The absurdity and obscenity of filthy rich, pampered, dim-witted athletes, safely sealed in five-star hotels with all expenses paid, adored by millions of people worldwide, wearing jerseys demanding fans ‘See Us’ and ‘Love Us’ is so astronomical as to be immeasurable. Then there is the MVP of Virtue Signaling, LeBron James, who should trade in his Nikes for clown shoes after he wore a Breonna Taylor ‘Say Her Name’ T-shirt and did an egregiously adolescent and nauseatingly pretentious Wakandasalutewhen Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died. Yikes. LeBron won the NBA championship in 2020 and nearly took the virtue signaling title too! The Oscars opened 2020 by virtue signaling about theenvironmentand ended it virtue signaling aboutdiversity. To paraphrase Schindler’s List, the Oscars’ new diversity and inclusion initiative isn’t just some good old-fashioned hating of straight, able-bodied white men…it’s official policy now. If the Academy Awards’ goal is to signal its virtue enough to make straight, able-bodied white men persona non grata in Hollywood, destroy cinematic quality and bankrupt the film industry, they are succeeding spectacularly. Bravo! Imaginebeing so self-absorbed that you think making a video of you and your wealthy friends singing the saccharine anthem ‘Imagine’ from your mansions during a pandemic when ordinary people are suffering unimaginable-to-you hardships such as losing their jobs, their homes and their loved ones, is a really good idea. I ‘Imagine’ a glorious utopia with no jackass celebrities or pathetically pandering corporations and certainly no virtue signaling. I know it will never happen, but it is a pleasant dream. Congratulations to all the virtue signalers of 2020. Your grating, self-serving displays of phony virtue are a towering monument to your own shamelessness and self-righteousness. Like this story?

"24 Dec, 2020",UK football club responds to fans who booed players for blacklivesmatter kneeling by banning some and ordering RE-EDUCATION for others,"Cambridge United Football Club is punishing fans who booed when players kneeled in solidarity with blacklivesmatter , banning some from Abbey Stadium for the season and requiring others to be re-educated before they can return. The club launched an investigation after hearing a smattering of boos when players kneeled before Cambridge United s December 15 home game against Colchester. Based on the findings of that probe, the team on Wednesday said it banned an undisclosed number of fans and issued refunds to those who had season tickets. Other politically incorrect fans were told they could get back into the stadium only after receiving discrimination and equality education. “Diversity and inclusion will continue to be at the heart of what we stand for as a football club, and we will be making no further comment about the incident,”Cambridge United said in a statement. CLUB STATEMENT | Cambridge United confirm it has taken action with respect to a very small number of fans after the Colchester United game in light of their behaviour when players took the knee.Full statement ➡️https://t.co/B7LYtLjA4K#CamUTDpic.twitter.com/A9hJgJ3Cpi Several club board members oversaw the investigation, including Godric Smith, formerly spokesman for then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. Individual fans were given the opportunity to“explain their actions.” But some observers found it absurd that a football club s supporters would even need to explain why they chose to boo.“Cambridge deserves to go under for this,”one commenter said.“Who on earth do these football clubs think they are?” Cambridge deserve to go under for this. An absolute joke. Who on earth do these football clubs thing they are? Stadium bans and education for fans who booed players taking a kneehttps://t.co/PbUjClwNVkvia@MailOnline Other fans said the booing was driven by disgust over blacklivesmatter s offensive political agenda, not racism, and they will continue to voice their displeasure. One said,“2020, and booing communismis punishable,”while another quipped,“Justleave footyto the woke, and watch it go broke. Good riddance.” blacklivesmatter desecrated The Cenotaph. They are a political Marxist organisation. This is why us fans find it offensive that the players are forced to take the blacklivesmatter knee. We are all for the kick it out campaign but not this. I will be booing at the next Cambridge Utd game. A similar controversy was stirred on December 5, after fans at a Millwall FC match hosting Derby County booed when players kneeled in support of blacklivesmatter , leadingmedia outletsto brand them asracist. A fan group for Millwall, the Millwall Supporters Club, said those who booed were responding to blacklivesmatter s extreme politicalviews and actions, such as damaging war memorials and Winston Churchill statues. Millwall FC responded by saying that players from both teams at its next match, against Queens Park Rangers, would stand together before the game and hold a pro-equality banner. Fans responded by cheering heartily when players held the banner on December 8. 🤝#Millwallx@QPR🤝💙#UnitedForChangepic.twitter.com/sNhwplPtZ1 Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"20 Dec, 2020",The woke left are demonizing parents and want to abolish the family. It’s the intellectual equivalent of a toddler’s tantrum,"Children raised in a nuclear family are safer, healthier, happier, and more successful. So, of course, the radicals want to abolish it and raise kids in communes, because “parents are tyrants.” Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo 2020 has been a year of pandemics. The most prominent of these is coronavirus, which has killed over a million people worldwide and wreaked havoc on the global economy. But it isn’t the only problematic outbreak to ravage the globe in 2020 – the pandemic of woke idiocy continues to rage unabated. One particularly imbecilic strain of this vicious virus is the agenda that espouses eliminating the nuclear family. As a parent and a leftist, I find this assault on parents and nuclear families to be the height of self-serving and self-defeating intellectual masturbation. A perfect example of this mindless mania is a recenttweetfrom Noah Berlatsky, a pissant provocateur and philosophical poseur who writes for the Guardian and the Atlantic magazine. Berlatsky whined,“parents are tyrants. ‘parent’ is an oppressive class, like rich people or white people.” He followed that belch into the woke echo chamber with this equally odious one:“There are things you can try to do to minimize the abuse that’s endemic to the parent/child relationship, but it’s always there.” Apparently, someone didn’t change baby Berlatsky’s dirty diaper fast enough and now we all have to deal with the stink. Sadly, Berlatsky’s buffoonery is not an outlier, as this anti-family mindset is rampant among the woke left. Examples of this absurd agenda being aggressively pushed abound. blacklivesmatter , the standard bearer for woke, fact-free, emotion-fueled idiocy in 2020, and which has garnered establishment support and millions in corporate donations, not only declare that they want to“abolish police,”but also“abolish the family.” Flagship left-wing publications like the Nation, Vice, and Jacobin have all in recent months and years dedicated time and energy to the malignant anti-family cause. In addition, Sophie Lewis, a self-described“feminist thinker,”which she proves is an oxymoron, has made a name for herself attacking the nuclear family in her book ‘Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against the Family’. Lewis, an Oxford-educated bulls**t artist, uses pretentious language and provocative statements to camouflage her laughably pubescent arguments. An example of Lewis’ utopianist jackassery is found in herarticle, ‘The Coronavirus Crisis Shows It’s Time to Abolish the Family’, where her“logical”approach to combat the virus is revealed as,“Free all prisoners and detainees now… and dismiss all the workers with full pay so they can… pursue laziness for at least the next decade.” Lewis likes tilting at windmills as evidenced by herdesireto“denaturalize the mother-child bond” and to promote “the idea that babies belong to anyone – the idea that the product of gestational labor gets transferred as property to a set of people.” Lewis further reveals her intellectual obtuseness and foolish anti-family fanaticism by declaring,“even when the private nuclear household poses no direct physical or mental threat to one’s person – no spouse-battering, no child rape, and no queer-bashing – the private family qua mode of social reproduction still, frankly, sucks. It genders, nationalizes and races us… It makes us believe we are ‘individuals.’” Individuals? Perish the thought! Of course, according to the anti-family left, the answer to the parent problem is that, like Hillary Clinton long ago taught us… it takes a village to raise a child. While it may very well take a village to satiate Hillary’s husband’s gargantuan sexual appetite, history shows us that communes and communal parenting are never a healthy option for children or society. For instance, abevyof high-profile Hollywood stars have grown up in communes and cults where the nuclear family was replaced with a communal approach and it was more ordeal than ideal. The famed Arquette family, which includes Roseanne, Patricia, and David, grew up in a commune, as did Winona Ryder. None of them speak highly of the experience, which included a lack of electricity and running water and rampant drug use. Rose McGowan, as well as Joaquin and River Phoenix, grew up in the communal, ‘free love’ Children of God sect that was rife with child sexualabuse. McGowan said of the experience,“There’s a trail of some very damaged children that were in this group… I got out by the skin of my teeth.” Studiesshowthat stepparents or non-biological guardians of children are astronomically more likely to harm children than biological parents. Yes, there are certainly awful parents in the world who abuse and neglect their own biological children, but Berlatsky bemoaning parental power dynamics and Lewis lamenting gestational labor are, ironically, the intellectual equivalent of a toddler’s tantrum. Wanting to eliminate the nuclear family because some people have had traumatic experiences is infinitely asinine and embarrassingly infantile; it is akin to demanding that the Sun stop rising in the east because you got sunburn. As any parent will tell you, raising a child is a Sisyphean task requiring a Herculean effort, but it is worth it asstudyafter study shows. Growing up in a nuclear family is, contrary to the anti-family left, not an albatross but an advantage in terms of mental, emotional, physical, and social health, as well as education achievement and incomelevel. What all children need are parents who love, comfort, protect, and guide them. And what these delusional anti-family advocates need is a reality check… and a swift kick in the ass. I’d be happy to deliver both. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"18 Dec, 2020","‘Was Beethoven black?’ In any normal society, the answer would be no, but we no longer live in a normal society.","Beethoven was not black. But, because of the woke times we live in, the famous composer’s race is still hotly debated. What a way to mark his 250th birthday. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 250th birthday passed on Thursday, and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brusselscelebratedthe iconic composer’s in truly modern fashion: by exhibiting artist Terry Adkins’ 2004 work ‘Synapse’ – a video depicting Beethoven’s frumpy visage morphing into that of a young black man with dreadlocks. The video is part of Adkins’ ‘Black Beethoven’ series, and the transformation is supposed to reflect the artist’s“unwillingness to settle the debate on Beethoven’s race.” Hang on a minute – there’s a debate? Well, yes and no. Beethoven was not black. Born in Bonn, Germany, to Flemish parents in 1770, the composer was byallaccountsas white as the driven snow. However, one 1814 etching of Beethovendepictshim with a dark complexion, and rumors of a Moorish ancestor fueled speculation that if he wasn’t outright black, Beethoven may have been a bit less white than previously thought. The famous Berlin anthropologist, Rudolf Virchow 1821-1902, re, BEETHOVEN S autopsy: ""THE POET OF SOUND HAD A MULATTO FACE...A LOWER JAW PECULIAR TO THE BLACK RACE."" Illustrierte Wiener Extrablatt 6.22.1888https://t.co/nwwqeJw1QPhttps://t.co/SmKF8apYIBpic.twitter.com/PNpve5VjdD By the time civil rights activists in the US caught wind of this, all subtlety went out the window.“Beethoven was as black as you and I,”campaigner Stokely Carmichael told a crowd in Seattle in the 1960s,“but they don’t tell us that.”Rolling Stone magazine even ran a story in 1969 declaring“Beethoven was black and proud!” pic.twitter.com/ll4Ral0CKh It was a rallying cry at a time when African Americans had just won their civil rights, and when racism was an ever-present force in the country. But it wasn’t grounded in reality. Half a century later, it’s becoming a fact. Nobody in their right mind would try to claim Duke Ellington or Louis Armstrong as white, and Barack Obama is still black, despite his distant Irish roots. So why are we doing the opposite? And why now? We canonized George Floyd this summer. As his gold-encrusted coffintouredAmerica like the reliquary of a saint, crackers everywhere took asymbolic kneeand renounced racism they didn’t know they held until the liberal commentariat told them they did. Our corporate masters pledged allegiance and dollars to blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ), and government officials in the US temporarily suspended coronavirus lockdowns to allow marches and riots in Floyd’s honor. But even before that, we took a look through our history books and thought,“Gee, this could really use more black people.” Black model Jodie Turner-Smith wascastby the UK’s Channel 5 in October to play 16th-century Queen of England Anne Boleyn – a woman who was definitely white. Likewise, the BBC has cast a black Achilles, while American theatergoers have been treated to a black George Washington in ‘Hamilton’, and Brits to a black King Lear, among other posthumous recolorings. Did you know thatQueen Charlotteof England andJackie Onassiswere black? They may have looked white, but the woke crowd has decided to reinterpret the Jim Crow-era “one-drop rule” to claim them as such, and who are we to say otherwise? After all, in 2020 black is not a color. It’s a state of mind. Just ask Shaun ‘Talcum X’ King, Rachel ‘Trans-Black’ Dolezal, or any of the blacklivesmatter activists whopretendedtobe blackto get ahead in the movement. Who knows? Maybe if Beethoven were alive today he’d be talking up his Moorish roots and penning sonatas for George Floyd. But he’s not, so that’s entirely the stuff of imagination – just like speculation about his race. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"18 Dec, 2020",English clubs ESCAPE sanction after fans boo players taking a knee but FA warns of investigation if incidents repeated,"The English Football Association has announced it will not be taking disciplinary action against Millwall and Colchester after sections of the clubs’ support booed players taking a knee earlier this season. “We have conducted full and thorough investigations into the crowd-related incidents that took place at both The Den [Millwall] and JobServe Community Stadium [Colchester] on Saturday 5 December 2020,”an FA statementread on Friday. “Having carefully considered these matters, including the observations from all relevant parties, we can confirm that no formal disciplinary action will be taken against the clubs concerned on this occasion. “However, we would like to further clarify that anyone who chooses to take the knee will continue to receive our support as they highlight the inequality and injustice experienced by the Black community."" The statement added:“To be clear, we do not see taking the knee as a political symbol, and would contend that there can now be no doubt as to what the gesture means in a footballing context. Therefore, going forward, we will continue to monitor and investigate should similar crowd-related incidents occur. “We continue to support all players and clubs that wish to take a stand against any form of discrimination, and will always condemn the behaviors of anyone that chooses to actively oppose these values.” A section of the support at South London club Millwall booed the pre-match gesture during their Championship game against Derby County earlier in December, which was the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown that a limited number of fans had been allowed into the stadium to watch their team play. A number of Colchester fans were similarly heard jeering when players took the knee before their League Two game against Grimsby. That prompted Colchester owner Robbie Cowling to offer any fans booing the gesture a refund on their season tickets so that they would stay away from matches. Earlier this week, fellow League Two club Exeter City ejected a fan from their home stadium after jeering was heard when players took a knee before kick-off in their game against Harrogate Town. The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) has revealed that players in England“overwhelmingly support”continuing with the gesture, despite anger from some fans that it is inextricably linked with the blacklivesmatter movement – which has been accused of promoting radical left-wing political causes, as well as causing destruction during numerous protests in the summer. ""Players overwhelmingly support continuing this act of solidarity despite any adverse responses that may be received,""the PFAsaid. The move not to sanction Millwall and Colchester for their fans’ behavior was welcomed by some online, who said that throwing the book at the two clubs would have been a restriction of free speech and fans’ right to protest. Why was this even investigated?? People are allowed to boo something they don’t agree with and football shouldn’t mix with politics! Why should they, freedom of speech is still allowed , just Wow. If fans can’t even express their opinion about this subject then there is no point in the players doing it in the first place. It has to be voluntary from both players and supporters. Otherwise we are doing it because we have to. Not because we actually believe in a cause. Millwall fans later clapped as players from Queens Park Rangers took a knee before their Championship game at the Den, although home players opted to stand. The two teams also staged an equality protest prior to the match. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"17 Dec, 2020","Shift away from ‘fashionable’ race & gender issues, UK equalities minister suggests – gets HAMMERED by liberal press","Equalities Minister Liz Truss has condemned the woke left’s focus on “fashionable” issues of race and gender, and called on the government to fight poverty instead. The liberal press, however, hounded Truss for her heresy. Speaking at the Centre for Policy Studies think tank on Thursday, Truss declared that the debate in the UK over discrimination should not focus on“fashionable”issues of race, gender and sexual orientation. Instead, she said the government would focus on the“real concerns”of poverty, class division and income inequality between the north and south of the UK. ""To make our society more equal, we need the equality debate to be led by facts, not by fashion,”she said, calling racial and gender quotas, targets and bias training“tools of the left,”the Daily Mailreported. I’ve read that Liz Truss speech and she’s right. Inequality is a disgrace and whoever has been in charge for the last decade should be ashamed of themselves. The 2010 Equality Act created nine protected groups based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Since then, successive British governments have focused on these groups in attempting to create a more equal society. Truss wants this approach put on the back shelf, and on Thursdayannouncedthe Equality Data Programme, a large-scale study that aims to map inequalities based on geographic and class divisions, in what the government calls“a new approach to tackling inequality in the UK.” The apparent shift in priorities comes two days after the governmentscrappedmandatory“unconscious bias training”for civil servants, after a study carried out by Truss’ office found no evidence to suggest this training works. In announcing the decision, Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez stated bias training“may not only activate and reinforce unhelpful stereotypes, [it] may provoke negative reactions and actually make people exacerbate their biases.” In the US, President Donald Trump recently banned the teaching of“critical race theory”– whose practitioners coined such terms as ‘white privilege’ and ‘institutional racism’ – in federal agencies, calling it“divisive, anti-American propaganda”that tells white people that they“benefit from racism.” Like Trump, Truss was hammered by the mainstream press for her apparent crackdown on wokeness in government. As she delivered her speech to the Centre for Policy Studies, the Timesreportedthat the Department for International Trade, which she runs, has“the second-worst gender pay gap”in the civil service, with women there earning an average of 15.9 percent less than their male colleagues. A department spokesman put the difference down to“the overall distribution of women across [pay] grades.” The Guardian, meanwhile, published anarticleaccusing Truss of picking too many“white, male trade advisers.”The article also heavily featured a black activist who accused Truss and the Conservative government of embarking on“a clear trajectory that seeks to downplay the reality of persistent race inequality.” Oh man...https://t.co/UNugAGgMqH The Labour Party’s shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova,calledTruss’ remarks a“gratuitous provocation”that dismissed“the devastating impact of discrimination and unfairness in peoples’ day to day lives.” So the Equalities minister thinks there’s too much focus on...equality... and *protected* characteristics...Maybe consider that “poverty and geographical disparities” are actually a result of race, gender, sexuality & class ie systemic bias#LizTrusshttps://t.co/SgcbGgZ544 Liz Truss attempt to separate class from race is divisive garbage. We need to create a fairer society for everyone - but this means recognising that the barriers faced by Black, Asian and other minority ethnic people are facts not fashion .#BlackLivesMatter The activist quoted by the Guardian, Simon Wooley, said Truss’ changes were coming at the wrong time, given the“historic moment when we could make the most fundamental positive change in regards to race equality ever seen.”Indeed, racial issues dominated the news globally in the latter half of 2020, following the death of George Floyd in the US. Surprisingly for the mainstream media, the public may be on Truss’ side. Apolllast month found that more than half of UK adults believe that the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ movement“increased racial tension.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"15 Dec, 2020",Lee Camp: Unemployment skyrocketing? An evolved society would celebrate,"Why do we still pretend crap jobs give our lives meaning? Lee Campis the host of the hit comedy news showRedacted Tonight. His new book, ‘Bullet Points and Punch Lines’, is available atLeeCampBook.com,and his stand-up comedy special can be streamed for free atLeeCampAmerican.com. This article was originally published byScheerPost. Leaf blowers are everything wrong with capitalism… I’ll explain that in a minute. We all know times are irredeemably grim, and they’re only getting worse. The unemployment level in America seems to be setting the record books aflame, and for somebizarrereason those numbers correlate nicely with the number of Americans under 40 living with their parents again. Understandably, the entire country is a littleon edge. If I spend more than 30 minutes around my parents, one eye starts twitching, a dull ringing settles into my inner ear canal, and I start to think Rachel Maddow (which they leave on 24/7 as if she’s Christmas music at Macy’s) makes some logical sense. Point being, in terms of discomfort, I would imagine living with your parents in your late thirties ranks somewhere between erectile dysfunction and having a brain-eating parasite. Anyway, back to unemployment. The Economic Policy Institute recently releasednew numbersshowing,“Unemployment has especially skyrocketed for young workers in the COVID-19 labor market... The overall unemployment rate for young workers ages 16–24 jumped from 8.4% to nearly 25% from spring 2019 to spring 2020… Spring 2020 unemployment rates were even higher for young Black, Hispanic, and Asian American/Pacific Islander workers – close to 30% for all three groups.” Unemployment is raging. Out. Of. Control. Forgive me, a quick aside about the inner workings of systemic racism. As those unemployment numbers make clear, not every problem in America involves racism, but every problem in Americaalsoinvolves racism. Systemic racism deniers refuse to comprehend this. When s**t is bad for young people – it’s even worse for black young people. When life sucks for the elderly poor in the United States – it sucks even more for elderly poor Hispanics. If the police are using weapons of war to crack activist heads – they’re cracking black activist heads twice as hard. If there’s a clean water problem in America – the water in Indigenous communities isn’tjustunclean, it has chunks of s**t in it! (Usually chunks of something Dupont used to produceTeflon™. I mean, what’s a few thousand people with cancer in order to ensure the egg slidesright offthe pan?) Now let’s break down this unemployment problem because much like a good one-night stand, you must get to the bottom. (I’m only half sure I understand what that sentence meant.) So, the surface problem is obvious: a lot of young people are unemployed. They don’t have money, they can’t pay rent, they can’t pay their student loans, they can’t afford food or life, they can only buy a regular coffee at Starbucks instead of the Frappe Unicorn Caramel Almond Juice Latte™. So that’s one reason employment is important. Why should we all have to be slaves to the labor market to survive in the first place? But if we excavate down to the second layer, we find a more important – and largely censored – quandary: Why should we all have to be slaves to the labor market to survive in the first place? Many people work their asses off grinding away at awful monotonous crap that shouldn’t even have to get doneat all. Our economy overflows with useless work. Utterly meaningless jobs, profoundly redundant tasks, excessively bureaucratic nonsense, woefully vapid spectacle production, joylessly soulless drudgery. They proliferate everywhere one looks. For example, daily outside my apartment window, in a parking lot, no fewer than three Leaf Blower People (technical terminology) blowthe f**koutta thousands of leaves. The entire neighborhood sounds like the middle of a nonconsensual monster truck rally for three hours every single morning. And as if that’s not inane enough, most days it’s windy out. The leaves return to their original locations15 secondsafter the guy blows them. So – much like a fluffer on a porn set – his work doesn’t last long. Not to mention, why do leaves have to inhabit a particular location anyway? At the risk of sounding like a radical, let the leaves be leaves! Let them do their thing. I’m a strong supporter of leaf self-determination. It’s not like they’re scorpions and allowing them to run free near domiciles is a downright danger to society. No one has ever found a leaf in a parking lot, gasped with horror, then bellowed,“The children! Will no one think of the children?!”Plus, we’re talking about a damn parking lot. What car can’t parkon leaves? (Other than a Kia.) And why the hell hasn’t someone invented a leaf blower silencer yet? We have a silencer for shooting people’s heads off, which one would hope happens far less often than leaf blowing. Where’s the Dyson vacuum guy when you need him? Get to work, mate! Invent the silencer. You can’t retire now – your legacy is not nearly secure. All you did so far was come up with a funny vacuum and a hand dryer thatspraysfecal matter all over people at public restrooms. (Yes, scientists found that public restroom hand dryers simply hose us all down in s**t flurries.) Well done, Dyson. Invent the leaf blower silencer post haste or you’ll be known as the“feces laminator”forevermore. So, we can agree leaf blowing is a nonsensical job. Much of the machinery of our society is filled with work, that pays people, that is inconsequential, insubstantial, and hollow. Yet, many of us do these jobs because we are wage slaves. We must hold down bulls**t jobs to survive. David Graeber wrote agreat bookabout inhuman empty jobs, and although I haven’t read it, I’m going to pretend I have to impress you. It’s a tremendous book. Can’t believe you haven’t read it yet. So this is the part of the column when I hit you with a groundbreaking, snot-snorting solution that rocks your boat and soils your pants. Here it is… How aboutNO? How about no more wage slavery? A lot of the jobs in this country don’t need to get done at all, a lot of them can be done by technology, and a lot of them could be thrown out if we just had a cultural awakening that scientifically analyzed our society to maximize efficiency, health, and sustainability instead of profit, profit, and profit. So at this point in the debate, people who suffer from Stockholm syndrome defend their wage masters by belching,“We can’t get rid of all those jobs and give people houses and food and clothing without endless life-draining soul-bleeding work – because then what will people do all day? People need to work at jobs they hate. It gives their lives meaning.” To that person I respond – Wow, what a rousing defense of slavery. It’s the same thing they said on the plantations.“If you free the slaves, then what will they do all day?” Well, if the people newly freed from their jobs have a passion, I assume they’ll pursue that. But if they don’t have anything they enjoy doing, then I actually don’t know what people will do with themselves — maybe choose to count their farts — but that’s fine because that’s calledfreedom. Many philosophers with far thicker gooey brain matter than I have said that we must create our own meaning for our lives. We must seek out and ascertain our own life purpose and folding shirts at Banana Republic isnota good answer. If people had the time, freedom, understanding and education, they would happily pick their own significance and aspirations. No one spends 23 hours a day grooming high-end dogs — making sure the ass hair is perfectly coiffed — because that gives their life drive. They do it because they need the money. How many people keep trimming the labradoodle’s“reardo”or folding the shirts or blowing the leaves after they win the lottery? It means he’s been indoctrinated so thoroughly, he can’t see life outside the factory. That’s like a prisoner who can’t leave the prison. This reminds me of a TV news story I saw about a blue-collar worker who won the lottery — millions of dollars — and said he was going back to work at the factory on Monday. And the news report gushed over how tremendous this was.“What a great guy! He’s going back to the factory!”But honestly, that shouldn’t be celebrated. It’s the result of a cultural brain disorder. It means he’s been indoctrinated so thoroughly, he can’t see life outside the factory. That’s like a prisoner who can’t leave the prison. It’s not something to have a goddamn ticker-tape parade over. We should want all the unemployed people to have jobs — because currently, without the jobs, they can’t afford their lives. But we should also discuss regularly how one day, preferably soon, we shouldnotwant to have these jobs — at least not full-time, slaving away at mind-numbing labor the employee loathes. But that conversation can’t be had on our mainstream media or even most alternative media. Everyone must partake in the wage slavery all the time because this is America – the freest country in the world! My boss told me so. Oh, and how will we pay for a leaf blowernotto blow leaves? How about using the trillions we pay for wars that are never won. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"13 Dec, 2020",‘Racist cowards’: Fans and players horrified as Champions League winner and football ace girlfriend cop ‘sickening’ online abuse,"Bayern Munich prodigy Alphonso Davies and Paris Saint-Germain star Jordyn Huitema have been barraged with vile racial abuse under an innocent holiday snap on Instagram, leading supporters and players to speak of their shock. The photogenic pair were bombarded with racist comments under a shot they had shared of themselves posing on a boat in Ibiza, which 19-year-old Huitema affectionately described as a ""baecation"". Almost four months after the picture had first been posted, a targeted campaign of poisonous comments appeared based around the colour of Davies s skin, variously calling the defender a ""monkey"", an ""animal"" and trumpeting archaic slurs about his ancestry and suitability as a partner and potential father. Davies has supported the blacklivesmatter campaign this year, joining his Bayern teammates to wear an armband in support of social justice following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police brutality in the US in May. Totally disgusted to read the comments under the photos of@AlphonsoDaviesand@JordynHuitema. No words for that except that you should never listen to people full of hate posting cowardly on social media. We don t give them a chance, love is stronger than hate!#NOTORACISM @instagramshould be embarrassed for not doing better. Those are extremely racist comments, I’ve reported some and they claim to not have an issue. Just brutal. People posting things as disgusting as that deserve legal repercussions. Speaking a month later, he toldSky Sports:""It hurts a lot, seeing all these photos of cops killing black males. ""I don t know what to say, it s just a very sensitive topic to talk about right now. All I want to say is that my skin color is not a crime."" Huitema used her Instagram account to take part in the Blackout Tuesday initiative, in which people around the world posted a black square as a symbol against racism. Unspeakable. What we can do is let Jordyn and Alphonso know that we support them; and hopefully our voices drown out those who have nothing better to do with their lives than spread hate. Disgusting excuses of humans. It’s just fear, man. Straight up fear. You know why they’re scared? If they had kids, they’d turn Canada into an unstoppable force in international football. Other countries wouldn’t have a hope in hell! 😂 She has been dating Davies since around the same time as they were both named Canada Under-17s players of the year in 2017, and the couple are known for their playfully intimate posts to their combined Instagram following of more than 4.2 million. Shocked readers said the obscenities were further evidence of the work needed to eradicate racism from sport.""It’s crazy, the type of stuff people say and get away with,""rued one. ""People filled Jordyn’s Instagram comments with disgusting and racial remarks. It’s 2020 and here we are...still."" So brutal. Two of the nicest, most genuine people you could meet and they are subjected to this. What is wrong with people?? I’m so sorry to read this ! It’s so hurtful but racism exists and these sick people need to be charged. These people are low lives which only attract hate and negativity in their lives. They look for any little bit of information to try and hurt other people but I hope that everyone knows that we don t share these feelings nor will we let these thugs threaten us. Another added:""I’m so sorry to read this. It’s so hurtful but racism exists and these sick people need to be charged."" Bayern defender Jerome Boateng said he had been ""totally disgusted"" by the comments. ""No words for that except that you should never listen to people full of hate posting cowardly on social media,""the Germany veteran told his Twitter following of more than 2.5 million. ""We don t give them a chance. Love is stronger than hate!""

A row also broke out over the taking of the knee before matches in England and the decision of a section of fans at one match to boo the gesture, leading to the team linking arms in the match that followed and holding up a banner. Huitema, who had portrayed herself taking a brief break with Davies less than a week after he lifted the Champions League trophy with the Bundesliga giants, did not immediately respond to or disable comments on the post. ""Ignore the toxicity,""one of the fans who had added almost half a million likes to the post urged her. Another said:""F*ck them haters - they can’t handle all this speed.""

"11 Dec, 2020","What in God’s name?

He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Anyone entertaining hopes that planet Earth might escape the insanity of 2020 without any more mind-blowing stories may wish to fasten their seatbelts for a hard landing. At a time when a global pandemic has swept away millions of jobs, andtransformeda handful of global capitalists from ‘merely wealthy’ to fantastically wealthy overnight, Pope Francis has decided to take sides in this epic battle. Any hunches what side that might be? Hint: much like the Vatican, it is immensely wealthy, influential, and acts like a government unto itself. Yes, you guessed it. Instead of the poor and destitute – you know, ‘the meek who shall inherit the earth rigmarole – taking their rightful place alongside the Pope to fight against globalization on steroids, the Vatican has announced it will form a“historic partnership”with big business, known as the Council for Inclusive Capitalism.

And make no mistake: this is no mere talk shop, but rather a vast undertaking thatinvolves“more than $10.5 trillion in assets under management, companies with over $2.1 trillion of market capitalization, and 200 million workers in more than 163 countries.” “Capitalism has created enormous global prosperity, but it has also left too many people behind, led to the degradation of our planet, and is not widely trusted in society,”saidLady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Founder of the Council and Managing Partner of Inclusive Capital Partners.“This council will follow the warning from Pope Francis to listen to ‘the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor’ and answer society’s demands for a more equitable and sustainable model of growth.” In other words, in an apparent act of divine intervention, the Rothschild family (whose wealth is estimated at $20 billion, although nobody really knows for sure), together with other famous brand names of globalization, such as the Rockefellers and Mastercard, will now take up the standard for the world’s downtrodden. Who will be the first one to hold their breath? I tried to contain my skepticism, I really did, until I read a bit deeper into this contract between the Catholic Church and corporate power. Any guesses as to who will ensure the corporate chieftains live up to their end of the bargain? Known as the Guardians for Inclusive Capitalism – I kid you not – these 27 devout and morally outstanding individuals all hail from the golden one percent. Let’s call them the Pope’s 27 billionaire disciples. Really outstanding people, such as President of the Rockefeller Foundation Rajiv Shah, CEO of Mastercard Ajay Banga, and CEO of Salesforce Marc Benioff, will now behave like Good Samaritans, carrying out the will of the Holy See around a ravaged, lockdown-wearied planet. And here is the catch: there is not a single Vatican cardinal or even a deacon on the list of Guardians. So, who will guard over the guardians? Yes, the corporate elite themselves! They must have read Donald Trump’s ‘The Art of the Deal’. My initial skepticism shot into overdrive when it became clear what acts of charity the council would promote:“The Guardians will hold themselves accountable, committing to a list of intended actions involving environmental, social and governance matters,”Forbesreported.“The Guardians … have said they plan to hire and promote more women, increase diversity hires, commit to clean energy by purchasing 100% renewable electricity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions...”Yada, yada, yada. Forgive me, Father, but that sounds an awful lot like the controversial progressive platform being touted by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that has divided the United States down the middle. In other words, this unholy marriage has already alienated at least one half of the US population, who fear a Biden presidency will herald in an age of socialism in America. Meanwhile, it is hardly reassuring that these profit-driven individuals will be allowed to“hold themselves accountable”to take on unspecified“social and governance matters”and“other initiatives,”whatever those happen to be. The reason for suspicion should be obvious. Aside from the absurdity of letting profit-driven corporations play guardian over themselves, we are now living in a time when these out-of-control behemoths are no longer content to just hawk their products to consumers; they have taken a serious stand on cultural and political issues, which many people find unacceptable yet must bear silently with a smile. Using their profits from consumer spending, corporations such as Coca-Cola can run an extremely controversial Spriteadvertisementcampaign, for example, that promotes a transgender lifestyle and that will be seen by millions of impressionable children. Or how about Gillette’s massively disappointing (and disliked)commercialthat took issue with so-called ‘toxic masculinity.’ Are these the“other initiatives”that corporations will be forcing on an unsuspecting public with the stamp of papal authority? Personally, I’ve never heard Pope Francis speak out against these extremely provocative ideas. Perhaps even more worrying is that many companies, compelled to prove they are taking a stand on behalf of the latest cause célèbre, have enthusiastically jumped aboard the blacklivesmatter juggernaut, which critics – of which there is no shortage, evenamongthe black American population – say works to the disadvantage of other races, not least white Americans, who have become the bane of Western civilization overnight. Is this the sort of ‘equality’ big business will be promoting with the quiet blessing of the Vatican? In their woke bid to become more ‘equal and diverse,’ will corporations begin to promote particular groups of people at the expense of others? After all, the Trump administration was just forced to take executive action against ‘critical race theory’ inside the government, while academia is now rampant with lectures teaching the evils of the ignoble white man. Are we on the precipice of a new age of racism in the United States and elsewhere, where the historic tables are turned with the help of corporate America? Although Pope Francis may have the best intentions at heart in promoting this sort of dialogue between the Vatican and the corporate world, unless there is real involvement by the Church to rein in corporate power, it will become a wasted opportunity in very short order. The Council for Inclusive Capitalism is nothing more and nothing less than a cynical PR stunt for corporate power that allows their controversial initiatives, heavily steeped in the rapacious accumulation of profit, as well as the promotion of dangerous ‘woke’ values, to win the seal of approval from one of the most powerful religious authorities on the planet. Such a program really amounts to an act of mindless virtue-signaling from the Catholic Church, which has fallen out of favor of late, and a cheap opportunity for the corporate world to conceal its behavior behind the shroud of morality and saintliness. It would have been far more effective and symbolic had Pope Francis committed himself to a contract with the people, with his true followers, in the fight against corporate power. Instead, he made a pact with the devil. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"11 Dec, 2020","After courting blacklivesmatter & progressives, Biden blasts ‘defund the police’ as vote killer","With the campaign behind him, Joe Biden is apparently taking a less solicitous tone with progressives, blaming the defund-the-police movement for hurting Democrats at the polls and warning that executive orders won t be a panacea. Republicans were able to paint Democrat candidates as favoring defunding of police departments, which is“how they beat the living hell out of us across the country,”Biden said in a teleconference with civil rights leaders, according to a report Thursday by the Intercept based on a leaked recording of the event. Republicans added at least eleven House seats in the November 3 election. In audio obtained by The Intercept, Biden told civil rights leaders that the Republicans’ ability to define the democraticparty as in favor of defunding the police is “how they beat the living hell out of us across the country.”Full story:https://t.co/ryYhjWzkMupic.twitter.com/jfRxDCvE29 Biden s two-hour meeting with Al Sharpton and other civil rights leaders was held on Tuesday. Some participants urged the nominal president-elect to use executive orders to quickly implement his agenda, but Biden reportedly cautioned that he won t stretch Constitutional limits of his authority to implement reforms that should first be passed by Congress. “I am not going to violate the Constitution,”Biden said.“Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds.”He gave the example of banning assault weapons by executive order.“We do that, next guy comes along and says, well, guess what? By executive order, I guess everybody can have machine guns again. So we gotta be careful.” “I will use it to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority, but I’m not going to exercise executive authority where it’s a question.”Inside Biden s meeting with civil rights leaders:https://t.co/Q6cHBYoGKSpic.twitter.com/Y0LwLkTTFV Biden stated that he will use executive orders to undo“every single damn thing”that President Donald Trump has enacted by executive authority, but claimed won t rely on that method when the authority is questionable under the Constitution. He also appeared unwilling to budge after NAACP President Derrick Johnson warned that appointing Tom Vilsack as secretary of agriculture would anger black voters in Georgia, where crucial Senate runoff elections will be held in January. While holding the same post in the Obama administration, Vilsack fired Shirley Sherrod, whom Johnson called a hero for black voters. Biden said that Johnson would soon learn more about Vilsack s record, suggesting that he will stick with plans to appoint the former Iowa governor. Progressives have their own reasons to oppose Vilsack, whom they dubbed ‘Mr Monsanto’ during his tenure, alleging favoritism of big corporations and GMO crops. Biden tapped the brakes on pressing for policing reforms before the January 5 runoffs in Georgia, which will determine which party will control the Senate for the next two years. I just raise it with you to think about how much do we push between now and January 5 – we need those two seats – about police reform. After defeating progressive rival Bernie Sanders in the Democrat primaries, Biden held together a fragile alliance with left-wing voters to help win the presidential election. Trump is now challenging Biden s victory in court, alleging massive election fraud. Biden s comments in Tuesday s meeting will likely frustrate progressives who reluctantly supported him to defeat Trump. Other party leaders, including former President Barack Obama, have spoken out about the defund-the-police movement contributing to the loss of House seats in the election. All four members of the Squad, a group of progressive House Democrats, criticized Obama for his comments. “The thing that critics of activists don t get is that they tried playing the polite-language policy game, and all it did was make them easier to ignore,”said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York).“It wasn t until they made folks uncomfortable that there was traction to do anything, even if it wasn t their full demands.” The thing that critics of activists don’t get is that they tried playing the “polite language” policy game and all it did was make them easier to ignore.It wasn’t until they made folks uncomfortable that there was traction to do ANYTHING even if it wasn’t their full demands. Biden s transition team didn t question the authenticity of the leaked recording, saying he s the same“honest, direct and realistic”person behind closed doors as he is in public. “As he made clear throughout the campaign, he believes in supporting bold and urgent reform to our criminal justice system while continuing to support law enforcement s mission to keep our communities safe,”their statement said.

"10 Dec, 2020", republicanparty officially calls on supporters to DIE for Trump with an ‘Ali Akbar!’ battle cry,"Ultraconservative fanatics in Arizona also cite Rambo as they seek to overturn the election result & vow to either ‘live for nothing... or die for something’. Has the republicanparty turned into some sort of weird death cult? David Haggithis an author published by Putnam and HarperCollins. He is publisher ofThe Great Recession Blogand writes for over 50 economic news websites. His Twitter page of economic humor is@EconomicRecess. The Arizona republicanparty ’s overturn-the-Biden-victory plan just became bizarre in a way that could only happen in 2020. The official party Twitter page this week retweeted a suicide martyrdom call that was republished byMediaIte: He is. Are you?https://t.co/OY8qxNMPxm The man who wrote it, whose Twitter handle is just ‘@Ali’, goes by the name ‘Ali Akbar’, though he also uses the surname Alexander. The controversial firebrand has risen to become one of the main leaders in President Donald Trump’s“Stop the Steal”campaign, at least if you believe his publicity. Who cannot hear echoes of“Die for Trump! Allahu Akbar!”in a tweet like that – the kind of battle cry used by Islamic fundamentalists with explosives strapped to their chests? Yet, that is the tweet the Arizona republicanparty chose to use to rally Trump supporters to a new level of resistance,asking,“He is… are you?” You might respond, as a rational person,“I’m sure the republicanparty is not officially suggesting people take up arms for Trump like some sort of fanatical fundamentalist.”I would have thought so, too… until, only a short time later, they clarified their aim with this image and message: Really?Rambo? So it really is,“Die for the Donald! Ali Akbar!”Where’s our latter day Colonel Trautman when you need him, ready to pacify the trigger-happy twitches? Apparently, the republicanparty got a little nervous about the image they chose because it didn’t take them long to pull it. But they didn’t get it down before the Democratic lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania commented on it, likening the Arizona would-be warriors to a“death cult.” The AZ republicanparty put out a casting call for martyrs over Twitter. This is truly bonkers and unbelievably dangerous. I’ve been saying all along about how *punitive* it is to be a Republican who just simply acknowledges electoral *reality*.https://t.co/w2Zrma0VrQ Wherever you stand on the 2020 election outcome, or whichever party you support, trying to whip up a frenzy of willing martyrs is dangerous, particularly after the US presidenttoldthe far-right Proud Boys group to“stand by”during the campaign, which means“be ready for battle,”not“go away.”It’s incendiary at a time when tempers are already red hot all over America about this election. As a call to action, it may embolden heavily armed people, who are already angry and“standing by,”to go white hot. Yes, the Left has so far been more lunatic in its violent riots all over the nation and its direct assaults on Trump supporters than the Right. Even the Proud Boys have been more restrained than Antifa and some blacklivesmatter protesters. Still, an official battle cry that is practically coded“Allahu Akbar,”with a Rambo chaser, is reckless. Because US election statutes officially designated December 8 ‘Safe Harbor Day’ (a law says that as long as states have resolved disputes by then, the votes cast will be“conclusive”), Republicans have taken the Left’s 2016“not my president”slogan, and amped it up to“Trump or die!” Over the past four years, the republicanparty has built up such fervent zeal for Trump as its God-chosen champion that it looks like a personality cult. Their Rambo post stating“This is what we do.. who we are!”does now make them sound more like a death cult. That’s their statement, not some baggage carried in a retweet. To whip up fervor against accepting the election results, they use the voice of Ali Akbar, a leader with an army of followers in the“Stop the Steal”campaign, who also has a dubious background, including convictions for theft and credit card abuse. Here is his official Twitter page with his scrubbed name: ‘Ali Akbar’ is more than just a handle. The editor of a popular Louisiana publication where Akbar used to live, and who knows and worked with him in political races,wrotea personal and concerned op-ed about his rise in Republican politics in which he labeled him an absurd extremist“engaged in reckless hyperbole,”and one who had taken to wearing a bulletproof vest when appearing in public. The editor, Lamar White, also claimed that the funds raised through Akbar’s (or Alexander’s) fundraising tactics are all deposited directly to his personal accounts:“After clicking the [stopthesteal.us] donate button, visitors are prompted with the option to donate money to one of several cryptocurrency addresses associated with Alexander, or given links to his Paypal, CashApp, and Amazon wishlist.” CNN have alsoraisedserious questions about the activist’s fund-raising tactics. So it’s a little unclear who is stopping the steal and who is starting the steal by using“Stop the Steal.”Akbar drags behind himself a long reputation of nasty allegations, particularly regarding his habitual manner of directing funds raised for big political causes directly into his own personal accounts, rather than to 501 (c) 3 non-profit corporations. According toCrooks and Liars, his background includes: “Ali Akbar, now President of the National Bloggers Club, is one of the conservative blogosphere’s most infamous characters. He began his campaign of notoriety with a crime spree in 2006, blazing a six-year trail of fraud. That’s him up there, in the mug shots… Akbar has never applied to the IRS for 501(c)3 status… “This would be less distressing if Akbar didn’t have a long history of covering up his tracks and minimizing his criminal past. In 2006, he stole items from a woman’s home; he later broke into a vehicle, stole a debit card, and withdrew money from the victim’s account, earning a felony conviction. Yet this record did not keep Akbar out of Republican politics. “Barely a year later, Akbar was accused of discussing election fraud tactics... Akbar was frequently and mistakenly identified as a John McCain campaign staffer due to his involvement in Bloggers for McCain, a “cooperating” website independent from the campaign itself… “In April 2008, Akbar pleaded guilty to the debit card fraud and was sentenced to four years probation and restitution of the stolen money.” Ironically, Akbar bills himself as“the nationwide”organizer of“election integrity protests”on his Instagram account. He maintains he simply“doesn’t have time”to form a legitimate non-profit corporation. Apparently, he never has the time because this isn’t the first time he used that excuse, according to the Crooks & Liars website: “Despite claiming to be in the application process for 501(c) 4 status in August 2009, ALA eventually was embarrassed into posting the following caveat on their website (though not their donation page): “The American Liberty Alliance is … not registered as a non-profit and we do not raise funds as such.”Yet they incorporated under the name“American Liberty Alliance – A Non-Profit Corporation….” “It does not look like a case of simple ignorance. If it were an isolated incident it’d be one thing, but it is a pattern…. “Akbar has been dishonest about his criminal record. His organization has been dishonest about its non-profit status.” For a long list of Akbar’s purported indiscretions, lookhere. Rather than sort out the sordid details, I’ll use Ali’s own defense:“I don’t have time.”Make of them what you will because I’m more intrigued by the republicanparty ’s decision to deliver a clarion call that sounds like a suicide-bomber’s final words and then to summon the Rambo spirit, declaring,“This is what we do, who we are.” I know the republicanparty is not full of wingnuts, psychos and trigger-happy cultists, seeking retribution for those Democrats who somehow took“first blood”by winning an election.

"10 Dec, 2020",BBC defends comedy show Vicar of Dibley from backlash over taking a knee blacklivesmatter episode,"The BBC has defended an upcoming Christmas special of its Vicar of Dibley series, which will feature the lead character delivering a sermon supporting blacklivesmatter , after receiving over 100 complaints before it even aired. The broadcaster came under fire when it revealed that a special miniseries of the show, titled The Vicar of Dibley in Lockdown , will see main character Geraldine Granger, played by Dawn French, address 2020’s key stories, including public support for the NHS, Covid-19 restrictions, and the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) movement. While the episode has not aired yet, some details were released in advance by the BBC. In it, Granger is due to say that""I don t think it matters where you re from, I think it matters that you do something about it because Jesus would,""before adopting the symbol of the blacklivesmatter tribute for victims of police violence and taking a knee. The programme trended on Twitter after the details first broke, as people accused the BBC ofabandoningits impartiality with its proposed coverage of the protests. Other commenters felt that it was a bizarremoveto force a fictional character, known for light-hearted and comedic content, to become  woke and deliver a serious political message. In a statement, the BBC rejected the criticism, stating that the fictional vicar""is a much-loved and well-established comic character and will be seen processing the year s events in her familiar outspoken and high-spirited way.""

"7 Dec, 2020",‘Wear a mask’ has been named the most notable quote of 2020 – because ‘do what you’re told’ was too on the nose,"The celebration of unquestioning obedience accompanying the Covid-19 pandemic has turned individuals into spineless drones. Nothing makes that clearer than corona czar Fauci’s “wear a mask” scold being named quote of the year. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Out of every phrase written or uttered over the past twelve months, Yale Law School librarian Fred Shapiro chose Anthony Fauci’s finger-wagging“wear a mask”as the top quote of 2020, as if to administer one last slap in the face to free will and rational thought. It is a very sick society indeed that celebrates knee-jerk obedience to an ever-shifting narrative and praises fear as the highest form of human emotion. Fauci’s quote and nine others are set to be included in the Yale Book of Quotations, a compendium of memorable epigrams, witticisms, slogans, and other short lines. Shapiro has previously explained he selects quotes that are“famous or revealing of the spirit of the times”rather than“eloquent or admirable”.But putting a banal, borderline-meaningless diktat like“wear a mask”next to famous lines such as PT Barnum’s“There’s a sucker born every minute”andFrederick Douglass’“Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will” comes off like a bad joke. After all, it’s not just the coronavirus commissar’s banality rounding out the top 10. Most of the other quotes selected for 2020 represent vapid political sniping so forgettable the average reader will scarcely be able to recall when they were said, let alone by whom, come the end of the year. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s throwaway pledge during her first press briefing back in May(“I will never lie to you. You have my word on that”)somehow made number five, while Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s bizarre“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black”outburst on Charlamagne tha God’s radio show clocked in at number seven. The closest thing to a meaningful statement among the top 10 was“I can’t breathe” –the last words of police brutality victim George Floyd, which have become a rallying cry for the blacklivesmatter movement. But even that phrase has been cheapened into a slogan to be sold as a souvenir ofcorporate-friendly ’resistance’and shouted during ritualistic protests that authority tolerates as a release valve for popular frustration. Heralding petty political divisions and cultlike appeals to obedience as “quotes of the year” suggests the American body politic is so hopelessly lost that any rule handed down with a patina of authority is immediately followed. After all, Fauci initially advised Americansagainstwearing masks, making the selection of his reversal as the year’s top quote all the more baffling. The health official told the ‘60 Minutes’ show back in March that“there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,”explaining that,“when you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people ‘feel’ a little bit better … but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.” Guidance on masks has shifted repeatedly since then, with each new iteration held up as the absolute truth to which all must bow or risk ostracism (or at least a hefty fine). The World Health Organization, which initially acknowledged universal masking for healthy people wasoverkill, declared last week that everyone shouldwear masks inside. Some local health authorities are even calling for masks to be worn at home – even as the science concerning themremains inconclusiveat best and flaws emerge in the‘gold standard’Covid-19 test itself. The media establishment has been treating humans like foie gras ducks since the start of the pandemic, taking advantage of the captive audience served up by lockdown to force-feed gallons of fear-porn down their throats. We’re told again and again that it’s a terrifying world out there and only stern, finger-wagging authority figures can save us – thinking too hard merely transmits the virus. It’s no wonder so many are wallowing in throwaway lines from insult comics masquerading as politicians, or melting at the sound of Fauci or Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates threatening a long, dark winter if we don’t sit down, shut up, and mask up. But if the best we as a society can come up with for a year-defining quote is“wear a mask,”we might as well throw in the towel on any pretense of having free will or independent thought. Humanity is better than this, and no amount of dull-witted gaslighting will convince the truly free to love their chains. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"7 Dec, 2020",‘Reap WHAT YOU SOW’: Dems now find intimidating protests unacceptable after Trump supporters target Michigan secretary of state,"Democrats have condemned armed Trump supporters who protested outside the home of Michigan’s top election overseer, but conservatives questioned why there was no such outrage over intimidation tactics used by left-wing groups. Michigan’s Democrat Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said dozens of armed people stood outside her home on Saturday night, shouting obscenities and chanting into bullhorns just as her four-year-old son was preparing to watch‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas’.Theprotestersinsisted that the results of the presidential election be overturned, she said, adding that“the demands made outside my home were unambiguous, loud and threatening.” The individuals gathered outside my home targeted me as Michigan’s Chief Election officer. But their threats were actually aimed at the 5.5million Michigan citizens who voted in this fall’s election, seeking to overturn their will. They will not succeed in doing so. My statement:pic.twitter.com/RSUnPSN4Aa The protesters targeted Benson after conservative media reports said Michigan’s Board of Elections – under her leadership and allegedly in violation of a legislative order – directed county clerks todeleteall election-related data from their computer systems. She has also been accused of giving Michigan voter data to left-wing activist groupRock the Vote, and sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications throughout the state without regard for voter eligibility. President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed lawsuits in Michigan and other swing states, alleging that hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes were used to steal the election on behalf of Democrat Joe Biden. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, also Democrats, called the protest at Benson’s home“mob-like behavior”and“an affront to basic morality and decency.”They added,“This disturbing behavior masquerading as protest should be called out for what it is and roundly condemned by citizens and public officials alike.” .@MIAttyGen@dananesseland Wayne County Prosecutor@KymLWorthyissued the following joint statement regarding the protest in front of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s home Saturday night:pic.twitter.com/RTTO5F2JEu Democrat supporters also rallied to Benson’s defense. Media outlets such as CBS News andMSNBCreferred to the state official being threatened with violence, while the Independent called the protesters an“armed mob.”Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP’s legal defense fund, called for“bipartisan condemnation”of the protest.“Jocelyn Benson is a superb public servant, and it’s tragic that she and others have to endure this menacing,”she added in a tweet, while New York Times writerKathy Grayreferred to the“current and sad state of the discourse.” This is what’s been unleashed. There should be bipartisan condemnation in Michigan and around the country. Jocelyn Benson is a superb public servant and it’s tragic that she and others have to endure this menacing.https://t.co/myZl7pvIS5 California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Benson was being threatened“for doing her job and doing it well.”Civil rights lawyer Kristen Clarke agreed, saying“any elected official with an ounce of dignity who cares about public safety and democracy would condemn this too. Silence is complicity.” My friend,@jocelynbenson, is facing threats and intimidation for doing her job and doing it well. Join me in thanking her for standing strong, and for protecting Michiganders’ votes and our free and fair elections.https://t.co/hqkO60tQa0 I condemn the violent rhetoric and threats of violence being levied against Michigan s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and her family.Any elected official with an ounce of dignity who cares about public safety and democracy would condemn this too. Silence is complicity.https://t.co/CZ3tEoKxPS But conservatives argued that no such condemnations were made by Democrats when left-wing groups targeted politicians and other people with intimidating and sometimes violent demonstrations. In August, for instance, a group stood outside US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s home in Kentucky calling for the Republican to be murdered. One of the participants said,“Just stab the motherf**ker in the heart, please.” Isn’t protesting at politicians’ homes the new normal?https://t.co/6J16nYLC1z Antifa rioters in Portland attacked the building where the city s mayor lived. A St. Louis couple was indicted on weapons charges for brandishing their guns after blacklivesmatter protesters broke through the gate of their private subdivision in June and allegedly threatened to burn their house down and kill them. Even random residents of US cities have been targeted this year. blacklivesmatter demonstrators in Portland marched through residential areas late at night in August, shouting at residents through bullhorns and shining lights into windows. That same month, blacklivesmatter demonstrators in Seattle went into a residential area anddemandedthat white people move out of the neighborhood and give their property to blacks. After some of Benson’s defenders called for statepoliceor the National Guard tocrack downon pro-Trump protesters, one Twitter commenter said:“Funny how the defund-the-police and government-is-fascist crowd suddenly want police and military when it isn’t your side. Dems started the at-home harassment. Reap what you sow.” Funny how the defund the police and government is fascist crowd suddenly want police and military when it isn t your side. Dems started the at home harrassment. Reap what you sow Others pointed out that, unlike previous actions by violent left-wing groups, the Bensonprotestersdecried by media outlets didn’tloot, damage property, orharmanyone. Beyond remaining largely silent about this year s wave of violent protests, some Democrats have even condoned confrontations, leading to harassment of Trump administration officials. US RepresentativeMaxine Waters(D-California) called on her supporters in 2018 to harass members of the Trump administration when they’re seen in public,“create a crowd”and“push back on them.” One observer suggested that the shoe should now be on the other foot:“As Maxine Waters says, give them no peace.” As Maxine Waters says Give them NO PEACE.HUNT Them out Give them no peace you are not welcome ANYWHERE in America.

"6 Dec, 2020",‘It is a political movement’: British minister in row as fans boo ‘divisive woke politics’ of blacklivesmatter kneeling (VIDEO),"The return of some fans to football in England this weekend has been marred by controversy after players took a pre-match knee to support blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ), leading to booing at one game and a range of outraged responses. Defender Mahlon Romeo was furious and striker Colin Kazim-Richards responded by lifting his fist as some supporters at London club Millwall, where 2,000 fans were allowed to attend for the first time during the pandemic, could be heard booing from the stands while the gesture was carried out before kick-off in a Championship match. Both sets of players were accused of performing another empty gesture, while a wider argument broke out about the politicisation of sporting events and the disconnect between liberal campaigning and personal choice. “The fans who have been let in today have personally disrespected not just me but the football club,""Millwall star Romeo told theSouth London Press, angrily adding that the match had been made ""irrelevant"" by the reaction of the fans while claiming that their boos demonstrated the ongoing problem of racism in society. Crowds at Millwall boo players taking the knee. I’m not sure why clubs are still doing this? blacklivesmatter , outside of the laudable slogan, is now a political party and one with aims to overthrow the state, defund the police and to divide us as much as possible!pic.twitter.com/WziolE7g81 Sorry, these gestures have no place in football. Deal with racism but stop this inane, divisive virtue signalling. This is what courage looks like.

That’s it – that’s all that gesture is. “And the fans have chosen to boo that, which for the life of me I can’t understand. It has offended me and everyone who works for this club – the players and the staff. “I’m speaking on behalf of myself here – not any of the other players, I want to make that very clear. This is the first time I feel disrespected. My personal view is that blacklivesmatter is a political movement that is different to what most of us believe in, which is standing up for racial equality.

This is different. To me it is subservient gesture to say “I’m sorry!” Sorry for what, being alive 300 years after some horrible things happened? If so then I do not need to be part of it hence the shout “Get on!” No, what *you* need to understand is that a minuscule 5 second kneeling gesture, to remind people that treating people badly based solely on their race is unacceptable is not ‘a protracted moral lecture’. If people can’t observe it or see the point of it, *THEY* are the problem. “I’m almost lost for words. I don’t know how they thought that would make me feel. I don’t know what they thought taking a knee stood for."" Many fans and political figures clearly remained unconvinced and confused, voicing their frustrations and misgivings with an act that has frequently seen athletes criticized after exercising their right not to take part in the US. ""Why all the fuss about Millwall fans making their views known when their players take the knee?""asked Susan Hall, of the Greater London Authority Conservatives. There’s also a fairly simple ideal.That you can go (and pay) to watch a football match to enjoy football & a little escapism from the ‘real’ world, without politics.It’s like saying that every facet of life has to have a political point.Will they take the knee at the opera? So at the next millwall game when teams take the knee before the game, will be interesting to see what happens. What millwall did yesterday was underline exactly why it needs to happen because despite all the coverage, the message isnt hitting home with certain groups. Inc you I actually agree with Paul on this one. It was a powerful moving act of solidarity the first time. Now it s part of the routine, it s lost its meaning just like the clap for carers went on too long. It should be done every now and then not before every single match ""They are entitled to their views. I’m not in the least surprised they dislike the subservient gesture. blacklivesmatter is now a political group wishing to defund the police. Ludicrous."" blacklivesmatter s official website calls for an investment in communities rather than law enforcement.""We know that police don’t keep us safe,""it argues. ""As long as we continue to pump money into our corrupt criminal justice system at the expense of housing, health, and education investments, we will never be truly safe.""

It was entirely predictable.Fans don t want divisive woke politics at football matches. 🤷🏻‍♀️ The display of discontent could herald more examples across the coming months as limited numbers of fans return to stadiums in the UK, echoing the row during and after an FC Dallas match in the US in which booing could be heard from around 3,000 fans. Dallas defender Reggie Cannon called the reaction ""disgraceful"" and ""absolutely disgusting"" adding:""You ve got fans booing you for people taking a stand for what they believe in. “Millions of other people support this cause. We discussed with every other team and the league what we’re going to do and we’ve got fans booing us in our own stadium."" #Millwallhave released the following club statement Why all the fuss about Millwall fans making their views known when their players ‘take the knee’ ? - they are entitled to their views.

George Eustice just told@SophyRidgeSkythe Millwall morons who booed players taking the knee should always be respected. What a shameful response from a Govt minister. The UK environment minister, George Eustice, did not condemn the booing but told a TV news program that racism in football should be ""called out and challenged"". “My personal view is that blacklivesmatter - capital B, L and M - is actually a political movement that is different to what most of us believe in, which is standing up for racial equality,""he said.

The look on players faces as the loud thunder of boos was omitted from a small crowd allowed to attend. Well done lads for showing the way. You set an excellent benchmark 👍 Personally I’m glad the millwall fans booed the kneel because now you will see if there is a genuine attempt from the fa to remove this mindset from the game or if all this kneeling is just tokenism ""If people choose to express their view in a particular way, that should always be respected.” Millwall, who have spent decades attempting to improve their reputation after incidents of racial abuse from the stands, issued a statement shortly after Eustice s remarks saying they were ""dismayed and saddened"" by the boos. ""The club has worked tirelessly in recent months to prepare for the return of supporters,""they said. ""What should have been a positive and exciting occasion was completely overshadowed, much to the immense disappointment and upset of those who have contributed to those efforts. ""The players are continuing to use the biggest platform they have to support the drive for change, not just in football but in society generally."" Long-serving Romeo warned fans not to ""spread hatred"" and claimed the booing had ""basically f*cked off"" the club s community efforts, which he said had been ""undone and attacked"". ""I feel really low – probably the lowest I’ve felt in my time at this club,""the 25-year-old admitted. ""I’m not trying to stop or contain – but if your beliefs and views oppose a positive change in society then don’t come to a football ground and spread them around. “When fans are booing a peaceful gesture to highlight racism, it naturally makes you ask yourself, ‘why am I putting myself through this?’ Millwall players had previously issued a statement announcing that they would continue to take a knee until the end of 2020.

"6 Dec, 2020","How blacklivesmatter , a Marxist political movement, toppled the establishment to become Art’s #1 powerbrokers","Arts Review has named blacklivesmatter as the most dominant force in the art world – the first time a movement rather than an individual has been voted top. It just demonstrates all that’s wrong in the woke world of modern culture. is an artist, art critic and author. Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist is an artist, art critic and author. Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist A 2020 “power list” issued by a leading arts magazine this week names blacklivesmatter as the most powerful force in the art world. This assessment from Art Review may appal and discourage, but it is entirely accurate. This year, blacklivesmatter has swept across the West like wildfire (figuratively and literally), inspiring mobs to topple statues, deface monuments and burn buildings. Even so, too few people realise how deeply arts administrators back this self-avowed Marxist political movement. Far from striking from outside the establishment, blacklivesmatter ’s hostility to traditional European and American culture is entirely in tune with mainstream thinking within the arts, academia and government. A new generation (trained in identity politics and grievance studies at university) believes it must back activism. It is not so much a question of staff choosing between personal politics and duty – many organisations have diversity, equity and inclusion policies that institute social justice as organisational policy. When the blacklivesmatter protests (quickly followed by riots) arose after the death of George Floyd in late May, the art world was keen to quickly get involved. TheTateissued a statement backing blacklivesmatter . Artists donated to the movement and arranged auctions. Creative Capital, which “funds innovative and adventurous artists... who shape the future”outlinedhow to support blacklivesmatter . The New York Times listed a graffitiedstatueof Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia as its number 1 example of protest art in the last 75 years. blacklivesmatter -supporting London Mayor Sadiq Khan vowed to“diversify”the city’s monuments and place names. The director of the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London celebrated the toppling of the Bristol statue of Edward Colston. Hewroteenthusiastically: “They all need to go!” (A bold statement for a registered charity, which is forbidden by law from engaging in political campaigning.) The ICA is a centre ofartivism, dependent on public funding and donations because it has a tiny audience. ItsTwitteraccount supposedly has 190,400 followers, but most of its posts have between 2 and 8 “likes”. So much for contemporary art, but how could a movement linked to iconoclasm be embraced by historical museums? Sympathy for blacklivesmatter ’s narrative of racial injustice, however, is widespread in museums. Linking slavery to the foundation of the USA – apparent in The New York Times’sthe 1619 Project, a political (and biased) reinterpretation of history – started in 2019 and had already paved the way for blacklivesmatter . The association of museum professionals in the UK hasstated, “We unreservedly support initiatives to decolonise museums and their collections”. It actively demands increased state support while wishing to use museums as political platforms – only promoting one side of the political spectrum, naturally. Museum staff are embarrassed by historical artefacts and terrified of being accused of elitism or racism. So, when the riots and protests broke out, the museum sector was willing to bend the knee. The British Museum engaged in the symbolichumiliationof its founder, citing slavery links. In the summer, the Smithsonian in Washington DC, issued a guide to“white culture”that was so controversial it had to be withdrawn. Museums in Western Europe hastened to put ondisplaysabout European culpability for slavery. Only a few historians have been brave enough to point out that displays and repatriations are often gravely biased. In a recentessay, historian Robert Tombs has written of how museums have presented distorted understandings of slavery. While the North Atlantic slave trade is well documented and commemorated, other slave trades go unmentioned. Tombs’s example is enslavement and brutality by the Asante (or Ashanti) people in West Africa. Researching my latest book, I read histories of Aztec slavery and human sacrifice. There is no part of the world – and no race – that has not at some time engaged in slavery. Portraying the North Atlantic slave trade as uniquely evil is a central tenet of American race activists, including blacklivesmatter . Dwelling on slavery is encouraged by lucrative industries of academia, publishing and consultancy. A glimmer of hope comes with resistance of black intellectuals such as Coleman Hughes. In hisreviewof Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility, Hughes calls it a “masterful exploitation of white guilt” and “zealotry disguised as scholarship”. But for white arts professionals to break ranks to condemn blacklivesmatter ’s tacit support for mass vandalism, destruction and looting of property is a rare act. A climate of fear in the arts prevents honest discussion of race activists’ violence against cultural material. blacklivesmatter has come to dominate the art world not by kicking open museum doors but by being invited inside. However, if artists and curators think blacklivesmatter is simply a modern extension of the civil rights movement, they are in for an unpleasant awakening… Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"4 Dec, 2020",Humor a great way to speak truth to power – ‘humor engineer’,"Humor can be a lifeboat in dark times when it seems we have nothing to laugh about at all. But how is today’s reality transforming what we find funny? We talked about this with Andrew Tarvin, humor engineer and bestselling author. Follow@SophieCo_RT InstagramSophieco.visionaries Podcasthttps://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/sophieco-visionaries Sophie Shevardnadze:Andrew Tarvin, Humour Engineer and best-selling writer. Great to have you with us today. What a time to talk about humour! Andrew Tarvin:Oh, absolutely. It s one of those times where people are like, ‘Is it okay to talk about humour?’ And in fact, it s one of those things that is definitely needed. SS:All right, so let s deconstruct this whole thing. You’re a self-described ‘humour engineer’ and you write books on how to master humour, make jokes funny, and seeing how we re in this wonderful year of 2020, do you see that the demand for humour is actually rising against a backdrop of the complete mess of everything, or not really? AT:No, it absolutely is. And I think part of the reason is, you know, with people being more socially distanced and much more things on virtual, they re realising how much humour that they used to have in their life that they re now missing because you no longer have hallway conversations with your co-workers, you don t have those impromptu meetups with friends, and even with strangers and people are wearing masks, you don t see the smiles and the laughs on their faces. And so, I think now more than ever it’s time to be really intentional about how we use humour, not just for our own kind of amusement, but also to do things like manage stress and build relationships and all the additional benefits that humour can provide us. SS:You said in a TED talk that humour has to be positive and inclusive. But here s the thing, isn t humour supposed to be just funny, first and foremost? And is that like the most important thing in humour, and then everything else? AT:I would say that. So that s true for comedy. Comedy’s goal is to make people laugh. But humour, we think, is a little bit broader than comedy. It includes things that are funny, but it can also be something that s just a little bit different, or something that s a little bit silly, where the goal is amusement, and our focus, at least, you know, as a humour engineer with my organisation, is in humour, that s just supposed to be funny, we re interested in humour, that is transformational, with humour that is encouraging, humour that is inspiring, humour that is calming in some ways, and ultimately, humour that works. That it s not just about making people laugh, but it s about getting some type of better end result, which the positive, more inclusive forms of humour certainly help with in the workplace, as opposed to more negative forms of humour. SS:Okay, but if we focus a little on comedy, and I m saying, like, stand-up, and you know, all these late-night shows, and even, you know, the comedies that we see coming up. If I have a really good joke, let s say, which is really nasty, at the same time, should I never let it see the light of the day, just because it might not really be positive or inclusive at all? AT:Well, you can certainly, if you re a stand-up comedian, then you let it go, you tell that on a comedy stage, and that s the intention to really maybe kind of toe the line a little bit and make people laugh. You could also do it with friends as a way to create a little bit of catharsis or if they share your similar sense of humour, especially in groups like emergency first responders, police officers, firefighters, etc., they sometimes tend to have a little bit of a darker sense of humour, as a way to manage difficulties that they re going through, the tough stuff that they see and deal with every single day, which is understandable. But if you are a leader of an organisation, or if you re in a company, or you want to build positive relationships with people, that where you re going to change the type of humour that you use, and that s where it all ultimately comes down to what s your goal with humour. As you mentioned, I’m humour engineer, so we don t think of humour just as a thing for fun, but how does it help us to solve challenges, either at home or in the workplace, and then depending on the challenge that you want to solve, it might change the type of humour that you want to use. SS:An old joke goes, ‘how many feminists does it take to change a light bulb? And the answer is: that s not funny.’ And it s my impression that humour has been having a very hard time lately. Whenever you want to crack a joke you should really think twice. Should I say this? Should I not say this? Am I going to hurt anyone? Is anyone going to be offended by this? Why has everybody become so sensitive? Who or what is to blame? AT:It’s a fascinating question. And I think humour is always evolving. The humour that was popular in the 50s and 60s, what we callvaudeville humouris more slapstick, it was more physical-based, that evolved into then more kind of jokes, like clear kind of set jokes of set up and punchline that evolved into more storytelling and authenticity with that storytelling. I think we re just seeing a continued evolution where some of the things that we used to joke about, hopefully we re saying, ‘well, maybe it s not actually okay to joke about that’, maybe what you think of is something like a light-hearted joke, is really difficult for someone who had experienced that for a long period of time. And so, I think it s just a cultural change, it ll continue to change, it ll continue to evolve. And part of being an adept humourist or comedian is adapting to the times and still finding the line and understanding when it s appropriate to cross that line and when it s not. In the workplace, it s typically, usually not appropriate across the line, except for in very specific scenarios. But in a comedy club, that s a little bit you know, different. So again, it goes back to where you re using that humour and what you want to achieve with it. SS:Well, I ve been talking a lot to comedians, especially stand-up comedians, because I m writing a book about humour in 2020. And I mean, humour, really, if we re honest with each other, especially in stand-up comedy, and with late-night shows, it gets really funny when making fun of something serious, right? Whether it s politics, or sometimes even some kind of deaths or tragedy... How does comedy survive if it s become too dangerous to be dangerous in your jokes? I mean, in a situation where you can t laugh at religion, gender, skin colour, sexual orientation, what is there left to laugh at? AT:Well, I completely agree. I think especially in the context of comedy, that nothing is off-limits, I don t think you can say ‘this subject you can t joke about’ because then who s to say, who gets to be the decider of that? But I think how you joke about it is changing because you know, the fundamental kind of concept or structure within comedy, specifically within stand-up, is setup and punchline. So, a setup creates an expectation in the listeners’ brain, and then the punchline breaks that expectation in some way. And I think part of the reason for evolution and comedy is that for many years, that kind of clear setup was ‘we re gonna maybe be aggressive towards this particular group’ and then the punchline kind of changes that. But you can see comedians who are doing this very well, like I would say, even Dave Chappelle continues to kind of approach that line, but because of how he does a setup and punchline, who the target of the joke is, when you really parse it and break it down, you re realising that the target has changed, where if he s talking about a certain specific group, a lot of times the target isn t actually that group, it s the society s perspective around it. And so, it becomes how you joke about that particular subject. I completely agree with you that I don t think any subject should be ‘off-limits’. SS:And I feel like this whole thing with humour has taken unprecedented scale, because if you look at what happened with Charlie Hebdo, and then just recently, a school teacher was beheaded in France for referring to Charlie Hebdo cartoons, which can get over the top on purpose. I mean, no doubt about that. I grew up in Paris, and you know, their irreverence in humour would annoy me a lot because I m not used to that. But at this point, like, it s unclear whether it s the cartoonists and satirists, and humour in general, that has to be protected in a situation like this, or do we have to set certain boundaries for humour so that it doesn t provoke outrage that we ve seen? And see, my reaction has swapped because last year, it was like over the top. And then this year, when I m seeing a continuation of this and the beheadings, even though I don t like that humour, I feel like Emmanuel Macron, I feel like we should stand up for humour. Do you know what I mean? So, I m having cognitive dissonance inside of me... AT:I agree with that because you have that balance between the two because, you know, things like this idea of freedom of speech or freedom of expression doesn t mean freedom from consequences. But at the same time, someone making a joke, the end result should not be them losing their life. And so, I think there s probably a balance of both and I would say it s probably more on the scale of people s reaction because, you know, as a communicator, you have to decide if someone is offended by something. That s data for you to kind of take into mind. You may not have meant offence by what you said, but understand, okay, why might this be offensive and ‘is that what I want to do, is that okay with me?’ So, I think the answer is a little bit on both sides, and people being willing to take responsibility and recognize that whatever your individual views are, they might not be the same as someone else s. And where s that kind of common ground that we can meet? Of which a different style of humour can help us get there. So, the other understanding is that there s a difference again between the setup and punchline of a specific thing, and other humour that we might use, and depending on the situation, which one is most appropriate, helping us get to what we want to get to long-term. SS:It seems like a more general question, but I always wonder about it lately. What is too much for humour exactly? I mean, who decides the boundaries of what one can joke about and how? AT:Yeah, well, it s a very difficult question. The interesting thing about comedy is that it is both very simple and very hard. And the question ‘is something funny?’, the answer is, ‘did it make someone laugh?’. And so, what s funny to one person can be very different than what s funny to another person. And so each individual person is kind of deciding that and then what you re noticing, and this is a particular challenge that I think, ‘Hey, we can all maybe take a step back on this cancel culture’, where some people are then starting to get upset about jokes, or things that they never even actually heard or ever experienced, or aren t even really offended by, but suddenly there becomes this kind of mob mentality where it s like, oh, everyone s kind of jumping on board against this one person, so ‘let s completely ruin everything that they have’. And I think that s too extreme. I think certainly how people respond to it - So you have this in the US where a writer was hired for SNL and it came out that some of his old jokes weren t exactly culturally appropriate. And his reaction wasn t about an apology. It wasn t about like, ‘Hey, you know, I didn t mean to offend’. It was more of like, ‘But I m a comedian, this is what I m supposed to do’. And the problem is, you know, sometimes people use a joke as an excuse to just say offensive things and it s not really actually a joke. And so, you know, that s that fine line in balance. I think it s a case-by-case basis, but it is what you as an individual do. I think if we all, like I said, had a little bit more compassion, we probably get a little bit further, but it s those individual decisions that people are making. SS:It s a really funny phenomenon when I look at the United States, because I see all these late-night shows’ hosts, which I adore, and they re vibrant, smart, intelligent, really funny, hilarious guys. And for the past year and a half or so I just see how they re stuck because they really can t joke about anything. Because people in America are even more sensitive than anywhere else in the world on the topics like, you know, feminism and blacklivesmatter and all of that that s going on, like the whole new ethics that is our reality today. And so, what they re left with is Trump. If you joke about anything else, you get, you know, either fired or taken off air, but you can joke about Trump because that s okay. And then half the country votes for Trump because he has become so popular because of that. Do you agree? AT:Well, I certainly agree from a news perspective as well as just the sheer amount of coverage of Trump has kind of run the discourse of what people talk about. It s something that constantly. At least growing up for me in the US, I didn t think about the president of our country that often, it would certainly come up but, you know, over the last four years it s probably been pretty much every single day, Trump has come up in some shape or form, whether that s a news story or a comedian saying a certain thing or that kind of perspective. And so, it is interesting that it s creating a lot more awareness and you know, just that person being the buzz. And I think that s partly why comedians are talking about it is because what everyone else is talking about it. So it s kind of a chicken and the egg challenge. I think you re seeing interesting, creative evolutions of comedy both because of subject matter, because of things like politics and because of technology, like a big part of Sarah Cooper’s rise was because she d took something and did things a little bit differently, right? We hadn t seen kind of that lip-synching thing. And that s what s interesting: when things become more extreme than what you used to? When this is like breaking norms, not necessarily in a good way, it becomes hard to create satire because the fictional satire that you write isn t as extreme as what the reality is. And so, Sarah Cooper adapted that by just saying, ‘I m not going to change any word, I m not going to pretend like this person is saying something else, I m just going to take it word for word, but add a different kind of performance to it’. And so, you are seeing kind of unique taste. And that s a surprise, right? That s creating a different setup, a different expectation, and then breaking that expectation. And I think that s the evolution that we re seeing. But I completely agree that there is tremendous value in saying, ‘Okay, let s talk about something else’. We as comedians or commentators or entertainers, etc. can help to shape what people are focusing on. And I think, finding those people and then allowing them, kind of giving them that platform could be very helpful. SS:I want to elaborate a bit about what I ve just said. I was talking recently to Frederick Beigbeder, the French novelist, and his last novel is actually about the end of humour. And he told me that the importance of comedy these days can be explained by the fact that politicians cannot really handle the situation well enough, often looking like clowns themselves. And it s the comedians who are becoming the voice of public opinion, who’re influencing this opinion just as well. Do you agree? AT:I agree. I mean, there s certainly even for the past 20 years or so people have considered comedians as the philosophers of our time. They are the people who are spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about a subject and finding ‘what s the way to communicate it so that people actually listen?’ And I think that s true. And you see this and other places around the world, but humour can be a great way to ‘speak truth to power’, where you can take a little bit of the edge off of something that s actually true that you want to say by adding a little bit of a humour component to it. And a lot of truth is said in jest, where it s like you can say a little bit of joke, but people are like, ‘Oh, actually, why is that that way? Why is that that culture?’ But what I think you re also seeing is… So, you re seeing that in by a couple of individuals, but you re also seeing kind of almost this public use of humour that I don t think that we ve always seen through things like meme culture. Meme now is arising. And it s both been used by, you know, people on the left and the right, etc. going back to politics, it was used by Bloomberg’s campaign in the United States, it didn t necessarily work, but it was like ‘we re gonna hire a bunch of like young 20 somethings to create a bunch of means to try to create and get this message out there’. And so, you are seeing this change in terms of how some of that humour is executed. But in general, comedians, yes, I think are they re great philosophers. You re seeing it, like you said, in the news programs, a lot of people aren t getting the news, necessarily, at least younger people aren t getting their news from CNN. They re getting it from Trevor Noah and the Daily Show, or they re getting it from these comedians who are doing more comedic shows and bringing that additional fun and perspective to it. SS:You know, continuing about my conversation with Beigbeder - He also compared the current situation and the role comedians play in our life today with the orchestra of Titanic, which continues to play while the ship is sinking. Is our ship going down as well? And since the comedians cannot really stop it from going under, is laughing about it the only way to accept the inevitable? AT:Oh, well, I think that laughing about something is a great way to make it so that it doesn t have control over you. And this is actually one of the disadvantages to strictly comedy and even humour in some sense, is that humour relieves tension. And so that can be a great thing when you re very stressed out. But it can also lead to a lack of emotion, when not kept in check. And if you think about it, if you think back to the traditional days of king monarchy, they intentionally installed a jester, a court jester, because that was someone who could poke fun at the king, make everyone laugh, relieve some of that tension so that they didn t revolt. You see the same thing the initial reason for carnival in some countries was to say, ‘Okay, hey, we re going to be tough and crack down on people for 11 months of the year, but we re going to give you this one month of celebration so you get out all of that tension and anxiety and everything like that in that moment, so that you don t rise to power’. And so, I think that s the disadvantage and so you have to understand that, again, it goes back to being a little bit clearer about the purpose of our humour, not just allowing it to be comedians going down with the ship and like, ‘Hey, we re gonna laugh at all this doom’, but how do we then hit that next step. And that s why we focus on humour is that it doesn t stop at, ‘Hey, we ve made you laugh’, but ‘now that you re laughing, you are listening, and what do we do with your attention?’ Is it enough to just say, ‘Hey, we made you laugh, goodbye’? Or can we implant kind of the idea or a seed of maybe we can all be a little bit better, maybe we can all be a little bit more compassionate about each other. Or you see this also with, say, The Last Week Tonight and John Oliver is that every episode ends with some type of small call to action. It s, you know, go to this URL, donate to this thing or whatever. So, you re starting to see this evolution where people are saying, ‘Okay, what do I do with this attention that I ve got? Let me try to transfer that to some type of change’. SS:You know, since it is much easier to laugh about your president or environment and kind of shrug it off behind a good joke than actually to get up and do something about it, can humour and joking about everything actually lead to complacency, fatalism? AT:Exactly. And a component of complacency is a great way to put it. If we relieve too much of that tension and that s where the purpose of that humour is, it needs to go that additional next step. If you want to actually create change, and you ve seen that in some different groups. So there s a group, I believe, the story comes from Serbia, but it s a situation where there s a group called ‘Otpor’ and they intentionally use humour not as a way to kind of just say, ‘Let s release some tension’, but as a recruiting rule for getting people to come in to this ideology of standing up to a dictator and they use humour to kind of poke fun at the dictator, but they made it fun so that more people would be wanting to get involved, because they had that thought, where it s like, ‘Okay, yes, if you re going to protest against something, people are going to be bored if they re just kind of out there standing. But instead, if you add a humour component to it, if you say, ‘Hey, we know this is tough’, it s not to say that the situation isn t serious but with a little bit of fun, we can make this actually more meaningful, more impactful, because we ll get more people involved because there s an entertainment piece to it’. SS:You know, it s like we re going through the worst crisis many of us might experience during our lifetime. Seeing how this pandemic is transforming actually everything, from the way we communicate, work, learn, our values, do you feel like it s transforming humour as well? I mean, will it be different from what it was before 2020? And if yes, how? AT:I think that it will. I mean, humour is just like so many things, is always evolving. And I think culturally, it s evolving. And I think the silver lining - I m an optimist, I think my grandmother is like the most optimistic person that I ve ever met. And I think that kind of like holds true for me. So, I m always kind of thinking about what is the silver lining in this. And I think part of it is the elevation of the status of humour. I think, like I said earlier, because we re not having the same forms of release that we used to have, if you think about, you know, we ve got more stress than ever, people are working harder than they probably used to, or they re unemployed. But they re doing it in a virtual space. A lot of times, if they re working from home, they don t have that work-life kind of separation, it feels more like work-life survival, and, you know, you re constantly working, barely ever turning it off, etc. So, you have this increase in stress, not to mention everything with the pandemic and everything else going on. But the normal modes of relieving that stress are gone. And you know, you can t go to sporting events, at least like you used to, even going out to get a drink with friends is now either a lot more stressful or actually impossible to do. Everything that you used to do is harder, even if you want to go hiking now there s thousands of people out on the hiking trails, because it s the one thing that you can do. And so, people are recognising, ‘oh, the thing that I am missing’. I don t think that they re quite there yet. But I think the long-term impact will be that people see, ‘oh, I need more humour in my life, I need more levity and how do I use it individually?’ I think you ll continue to see this kind of democratisation of individuals using humour, where it ll be less of a focus of - And there s still going to be entertainers and comedians, but I think more people will ignore what they used to say, like, ‘Oh, I could never do that’ or ‘I m not funny’. My hope, my goal is that more and more people recognise that, ‘Oh, no, this is a skill, it s a skill that I can and should learn, and here s how I m going to bring my own personal style, not that I m not going to necessarily be a stand-up comedian, but maybe I m going to share more stories, maybe I m going to do some cartoons, maybe I m going to do some things just specifically for myself so that I am able to deal with the challenge that we have every single day’. SS:Andrew, thank you so much for this wonderful insight about how humour 2020 is transforming. It s been really interesting talking to you. I wish you good luck with everything. AT:Thanks, it was fantastic talking with you, I loved that you ve clearly done your research and have a lot of insight of where it is going. I will say that, you know, for me again, our focus is how do we as individuals, take ownership of our own situation and use humour to help improve it. But I also loved this conversation of the macro view of comedy and where it s going. So I appreciate the chance to have the conversation. SS:Thank you so much, Andrew, stay safe. AT:Thank you. SS:Bye. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RTPrivacy policyto find out more.

"2 Dec, 2020",So you think a bitter Trump is behaving disgracefully over relinquishing the White House? History shows he’s not the first...,"‘Ok, loser, it’s time to give up power. That means you, Mr Ex-President.’ It’s never an easy message for leaders to swallow, and the current one is obviously finding it harder than most. But he has some illustrious company. ByPolly Boiko, Senior Editor based in London. Before that she was the face of satirical online project ICYMI, and reported on important events as the UK correspondent for RT International. Follow her on Twitter@polly_boiko The transition of power in America, in those dark, cold weeks between the election in November and the new president’s inauguration in January, is a delicate process. It’s a chance for the self-styled ‘world’s greatest nation’ to show others how a grown-up, mature democracy acts. And a chance for the outgoing, soon to be ex-leader of “of the free world” to demonstrate that he (no she’s yet, Kamala, wait your turn) is above feeling bitter, sour, or uncooperative. Even. Though. He’s. A. LOSER. And staring down the barrel of  “consulting” for Goldman Sachs, endless ribbon-cutting ceremonies and dreary after-dinner speeches, tedious charity work, and the obligatory setting up of a (ex) presidential library that no one wants to visit. A life in decline, where your only bit of fun isgrabbing the assesof women that are in your line of fire because you’re in a wheelchair. At best, the handover of power involves a good working relationship, or at least a mutual respect, between the incumbent, lame-duck prez, and the newly-elected leader who’s headed for the White House. The words that should be at the forefront here are ones such as honourable, graciousness, decentness and humility - witness one-term George H Bush’s handwrittenletterleft for his usurper Bill Clinton in 1993: “You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.” And then there’s the Donald Trump way. The words that come to mind here are one such as immature, sore loser, spoiled brat, and thin-skinned. Doing the presidential equivalent of stamping his foot and taking his ball home, it looks a lot like Trump is, well, doing his best to f**k it up for the incoming Biden administration. He’s blacklisting Chinese companies in the US before a China-friendlier Biden even takes office. He’s ordering troops back home from Afghanistan and other hot spots, against the wishes of most generals. He’s presided over a Department of Justice rule change that will effectively bring back firing squads and electric chairs for states that can’t get hold of the drugs for lethal injections (and yet, go figure, he’s against abortions…). He’s apparently considering handing our preemptive pardons to favoured consigliere such as Rudy Guliani and the like, and maybe even one for himself and his family. And he’s still not even accepted the reality that – sorry, Mr President – he LOST last month’s election, big time. Why concede when you can still whine, after all? He’s managing to convince half of America (the red half, natch) that the election was stolen from him, simply through repeating it loudly and often, despite no evidence to support his claims. ‘RIGGED ELECTION!’, ‘FAKE RESULT!’, ‘STOP THE STEAL!’, ‘WE WON!”. Donald’s the orange-hued Dory of this satirical s**tshow: “Just keep tweeting… just keep tweeting…” Then it must all be true, huh? What’s the next scene, a flouncy refusal to attend his successor’s inauguration on January 20? Except maybe at the head of a bunch of armed Proud Boys, marching down 16th Street (sorry, blacklivesmatter Plaza), standing by ready to reoccupy the White House? I suppose it means we’re not likely to see some uber-awkward and ultra-civil photos like the ones of Trump and Barack Obama back in 2016 – when Obama had to be a good ol’ boy, grit his teeth, andwelcomehis nemesis into the White House. But many presidential transitions have been tough. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the founding fathers and supposed BFFs,fell outso badly during the course of the election in 1800 that Adams didn’t even go to Jefferson’s inauguration. In 1828, when Andrew Jackson won the election, the vitriol, including charges of adultery, thrown at him by his opponent, John Quincy Adams, was so vicious that he became convinced it contributed to his wife dying of a heart attack just before Christmas. Understandably bitter, Jackon refused to pay a courtesy call on Adams during the three weeks before his inauguration, which the defeated man then refused to attend. But history also shows us that, sometimes, making a transition awkward can be all about doing very little. Take the great depression election of 1932, when Herbert Hoover had to make way for Franklin D Roosevelt. HooverhatedFDR, mostly for being disabled. He called the partially paralyzed FDR a “chameleon on plaid”, accused him of dealing “from the bottom of the deck”, and said that the Democrat’s tendencies would put the USA “on a march to Moscow.” So, in the midst of the worst banking crisis ever, lame-duck Hoover sat back and did nothing to improve the dire economic situation or intervene. Paving the way for FDR to inherit an even bigger mess. In response, FDR called Hoover a “fat, timid, capon.” Which, of course, is a castrated rooster. A fat and timid one, at that. The period of a presidential transition is also a dangerous one when it comes to foreign policy. It’s unlikely that Israel would have whacked that Iraniannuclear scientistlast week without Trump’s tacit approval – perhaps in the hope of provoking Tehran into doing something rash. Both Bibi Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, and the Donald are said to feel a rising anxiety about the impending arrival of the Biden team, which wants to bring the Iranian nuclear deal back from the deep freeze. The disastrous Bay of Pigsfiascoin April, 1961, the failed US-backed invasion of Cuba, took place just three months into the John F. Kennedy presidency. Many historians have blamed it on the power vacuum of the transitional period. An original, stealthy plan had been approved by Eisenhower. By the time his old guard in the CIA sold it to a freshly inaugurated Kennedy, it had ballooned into a full-blown invasion. But there’s awkward transitions, and then there’s Bill Clinton. His team’s lack of largesse, shall we call it, when handing over the reins to George W Bush after a bitterly contested legal fight with Bill’s chosen successor Al Gore over the election in 2000, has become the stuff of legend. First of all, there’s the presidential pardon controversy. Clinton, aided by his lobbyist brother and brothers-in-law, pardoned 140 people on his last day in office. His list of excused included world-wide pariah Marc Rich, a cocaine trafficking kingpin, a few major terrorists, and, oh yeah, his own brother, Roger. But even then, the Clinton team didn’t leave the White House gracefully. Democrat staffers reportedly ripped phones from the walls, cut presidential seals from the carpets and left anti-Bush graffiti in the stalls of the men’s toilets. But perhaps best and bitterest of all, they removed the letter W from 62 of the White House’s computers - which was a bit of a problem since George W was referred to simply as “W” to differentiate him from his dad. It was obviously a prank. Some of the missing W keys were eventually found on top of extremely high door frames. The Clinton team denied many of these claims, but the General Accounting Officereportedthat the White House had suffered $15,000 worth of damage. A third of that had to be spent on replacing keyboards. So transitions of power are a spectrum, with the Clinton-to-Dubya transition at one end of the scale (we’ll call it the ‘college frat party’ end), the ‘Fat capon’, do-nothing Hoover-Roosevelt somewhere in the middle, and the frankly delightful, if awks, Obama-to-Trump transition at the ‘tea with the Queen’ end. We’re yet to see where the 2020/2021 handover of power is going to end up. But I think it might, just might, trump the lot of them for its sheer awfulness. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"1 Dec, 2020",‘I’d make him eat the canvas’: UFC’s Covington vows to knock out Trump critic LeBron in a fight as he slams ‘privileged’ NBA stars,"UFC loudmouth Colby Covington has taken aim at LeBron James - an opponent of his political hero, Donald Trump - by warning that he would hand him an even more brutal knockout than ex-NBA star Nate Robinson suffered in the ring. Breaking his silence on Twitter for the first time since last month s US presidential election, welterweight number one Covington cruelly joked that Robinson, who switched sports to make his boxing debut on Saturday, had only just been removed from the ring following his harrowing knockout defeat to YouTuber Jake Paul. The devout Republic and proponent of Trump s ""Make America Great Again"" campaign then took aim at NBA legend LeBron James, warning that he would knock out the man who had laughed at Trump s defeat in half of the two rounds it took Paul to beat Robinson. ""Heard they finally scraped Nate Robinson s carcass off the Staples Center floor,""wrote Covington, responding to the celebrity scrap on the undercard of Mike Tyson s draw with Roy Jones Jr. Heard they finally scraped@nate_robinson’s carcass off the@staplescenterfloor. I’d make@kingjameseat the canvas in half the amount of time. Everyone knows current@NBAplayers are the softest and most privileged athletes on the planet.#TysonJones#Facts Colby and Donald RN:pic.twitter.com/TFt81i6x9R Who’s your daddypic.twitter.com/iRkztvsfVv ""I’d make LeBron James eat the canvas in half the amount of time. Everyone knows current NBA players are the softest and most privileged athletes on the planet."" Five-time NBA champion Magic Johnson has been among those to tweet their support for Robinson following the defeat that left him faceplanted on the canvas after he walked onto a huge shot in his first professional fight. The former Boston Celtics and New York Knicks has reassured fans that he is recovering from his ordeal, and Covington s keenness to put himself in line for a similarly money-spinning fight with sporting icon James could be driven by a desire to enjoy a win as easy as professional boxer Paul s was in Los Angeles. Covington s imagined mismatch against James would offer him another opportunity to stoke a politically-fueled build-up, having posed with Trump at one of his election rallies, worn merchandising supporting the head of state during his press conferences and shared a phone call with him after his acrimonious win over Tyron Woodley in September. James has long been an antagonist of Trump, leading to the outgoing president, who has fiercely criticized the blacklivesmatter campaign that the Lakers talisman is a figurehead for, calling the four-time champion ""nasty"" and a ""hater"". Lebron would beat your ass in 45 seconds lmao Ahhhh yet another person who doesn’t know a thing about fighting apparently 😂 and can’t respect the talent of Colby Covington because his words hurt his feelings 😂#yournotsmart You may like who you want, but if you think LeBron would have a chance in a fight you are crazy! The chance he wins is as big as Colby beating LeBron one vs one on a basketball court! Trump claimed that social justice protests by NBA players had damaged TV ratings for the sport and remarked ""what a crowd"" when the audience at one of his rallies began a chant of ""LeBron sucks"", and James s responses on social media have included superimposing the head of victorious candidate Joe Biden onto his head in a photo from one of the most spectacular blocks of his career. Covington has been uncharacteristically quiet across all of his social media accounts since the election, and his tweet proved an emphatic return to divisive form, accumulating more than 10,000 retweets and likes. ""You got most of your privilege from slurping up a guy that just absolutely sh*t it at the election,""said one critic. ""I d stop calling out non-fighters and concentrate on what your next gimmick will be."" A fight fan said:""If you think LeBron would have a chance in a fight, you are crazy. The chance he would win is as big as Colby beating LeBron one-on-one on a basketball court."" RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"27 Nov, 2020",More than half of UK adults say blacklivesmatter movement INCREASED racial tensions – poll,"The majority of UK adults believe that recent anti-racism blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protests actually deepened the nation’s racial divisions and increased tensions, a newly released poll has revealed. Some 55 percent of Britons think that the blacklivesmatter wave of anti-racist demonstrations backfired and exacerbated racial tensions, a newly released poll conducted in October by Opinium found, based on a survey of more than 2,000 people. Views on the controversial movement appear to also be split within ethnic minority groups, with 44 percent of people in those communities blaming blacklivesmatter for intensifying the racial divide. Only 17 percent of all respondents disagreed with the sentiment that the anti-racism movement had made matters worse. The movement’s organisers justified the numbers as merely showing that blacklivesmatter has exposed existing issues in society. They noted parallel research which has shown sharp rises in the numbers of black Britons saying they had faced discrimination over the past year, the Guardian reported. That figure rose by seven percent in 2020, to 81 percent. The statistics seem to mirror increased discrimination rates against Asian people, which were up from 68 percent to 76 percent this year – the rise coinciding with the Covid-19 virus originating in Wuhan, China. In demographic terms, the survey found white people were more likely to say the blacklivesmatter protests had increased racial tensions – particularly Conservative voters, 78 percent of whom said it had a negative impact on race relations. blacklivesmatter spokesperson Adam Elliott-Cooper hit back against the survey, saying it was“misleading”to suggest that challenging racism increases racial tension. “ blacklivesmatter hasn’t increased racial tension, in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn’t, or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa didn’t,”he said, adding:“They haven’t increased racial tension, but they might have made it more apparent and exposed what is there.” Think your friends would be interested?

"27 Nov, 2020",Is ANYONE actually surprised that rioting comrades Antifa & blacklivesmatter are seeking a divorce as racial tensions come to the fore?,"After months of carnage in US cities, tensions are rising between the two main perpetrators, Antifa and blacklivesmatter .

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC If there are two organizations that can be held most responsible for the riots that have scarred America throughout 2020, it is blacklivesmatter and Antifa. These groups have caused millions upon millions of dollars’ worth of damage and committed hundreds of crimes in the pursuit of what they consider ‘justice’. I know the true end game for these groups is not the election of Joe Biden, but I get the sense that they’re at least happy that Donald Trump is going to be out of office (barring the biggest case of voter fraud in history). And with that small victory, it would appear that a divorce is under way between the two groups. According to certainsources, there have been tensions for months over Antifa’s way of doing things and whether or not this has tainted the protests. After all, when you start lighting cities on fire across the nation, it’s pretty safe to assume that people are going to stop listening. You go from being someone with something to say to someone intent on destruction. Hardly the best way to get a point across. There are also issues over authenticity. Some blacklivesmatter activists are pointing out that many of the members of Antifa are white and“privileged.”And the Antifa groups are digging through social media trying to ‘cancel’ social justice protesters. So, it seems like Antifa is too white and too rich for blacklivesmatter tastes, and some organizers in blacklivesmatter aren’t pure enough for Antifa. As someone who has seen both of these groups do what they can to damage his country, it’s hard not laugh as I watch this all play out, mostly because it’s entirely predictable if you understand the reality of the situation. On one side, there are blacklivesmatter organizers with skeletons in theircloset. On the flip side, Antifa’s demographic tends to be rather similar to a Ku Klux Klan meeting. These issues have been pointed out over the course of months. Many people on social media have seen videos of mostly white crowds, made up of Antifa supporters, chanting blacklivesmatter slogans. The irony of the situation is that they’re usually chanting them at someone who is not white. And for all of their supposed attempts at seeking ‘justice’, all they have managed to do so far is light fires as another old white guy was nominated by the Democrats. In a sense, all it was going to take was time for these groups to actually look at one another and realize that there is no natural fit. That is the funny part. Both of these groups are doomed to fail, because they do not seek anything positive. They say that they do, but actions speak louder than words. You cannot claim to want justice for one group while committing injustices toward another and expect people to pay attention. The bitter irony? Two groups that say that they are battling for racial justice are dividing among racial lines. If the irony were any more delicious, you could serve it up as a Thanksgiving dessert.

"25 Nov, 2020",Chris Hedges: The ruling elite’s war on truth,"American political leaders display a widening disconnect from reality intended to mask their complicity in the seizure of power by global corporations and billionaires. ByChris Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for The New York Times, where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper. He previously worked overseas for The Dallas Morning News, The Christian Science Monitor, and NPR. He is the host of the Emmy Award-nominated RT America showOn Contact. This article was originally published byScheerPost. Joe Biden’s victory instantly obliterated the democraticparty ’s longstanding charge that Russia was hijacking and compromising US elections. The Biden victory, the democraticparty leaders and their courtiers in the media now insist, is evidence that the democratic process is strong and untainted, that the system works. The elections ratified the will of the people. But imagine if Donald Trump had been reelected. Would the Democrats and pundits at the New York Times, CNN and MSNBC pay homage to a fair electoral process? Or, having spent four years trying to impugn the integrity of the 2016 presidential race, would they once again haul out the blunt instrument of Russian interference to paint Trump as Vladimir Putin’s Manchurian candidate? Trump and Rudy Giuliani are vulgar and buffoonish, but they play the same slimy game as their Democratic opponents. The Republicans scapegoat the deep state, communists and now, bizarrely, Venezuela; the Democrats scapegoat Russia. The widening disconnect from reality by the ruling elite is intended to mask their complicity in the seizure of power by predatory global corporations and billionaires. “This is a disgraceful thing that was done in this country,”Giuliani said at his recent bad-hair-day press conference.“Probably not much more disgraceful than the things these people did in office, which you didn’t and don’t bother to cover and you conceal from the American people, but we let this happen, we use largely a Venezuelan voting machine in essence to count our vote. We let this happen. We’re going to become Venezuela. We cannot let this happen to us. We cannot allow these crooks, because that’s what they are, to steal an election from the American people. They elected Donald Trump. They didn’t elect Joe Biden. Joe Biden is in the lead because of the fraudulent ballots, the illegal ballots, that were produced and that were allowed to be used, after the election was over.” Giuliani’s rant was topped by those of Sidney Powell,until recentlyanother of Trump’s lawyers, who blamed software designed for Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013, for Trump’s loss, as well as“the massive influence of Communist money.”The software“was created so Hugo Chavez would never lose another election, and he did not after that software was created,”Powell said.“He won every single election and then they exported it to Argentina and other countries in South America, and then they brought it here.” Compare this to how Hillary Clinton, during the recent primary campaign, warned that the Russians were“grooming”a female candidate, widely assumed to be Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, to run as a third-party candidate to serve Russian interests. Previously, Clinton called the 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein a“Russian asset.”She insisted, although the Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his prosecutors found no evidence to support her charge, that the Trump campaign worked closely in 2016 with Moscow and WikiLeaks – which she insists is a Russian front – to defeat her. Hillary’s staff put together a“hit list”in the final days of her 2008 campaign, according to the book, Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, listing those who were loyal to the Clintons those who were not. They used a scale of 1 to 7. “Step back and think about it,”Clinton wrote in her book, What Happened ,about the 2016 election.“The Russians hacked our election systems. They got inside. They tried to delete or alter voter information. This should send a shiver down the spine of every American.” Never mind that both ruling parties are silent about the massive interference in our elections by Israel, which uses its lobbying groups to lavishly fund political candidates in both parties and flies members of Congress and their families to Israel for junkets at seaside resorts. Israel’s intrusion in our political process, including when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress in 2015, without informing then President Barack Obama, to attack the president’s Iran nuclear deal, dwarfs that of any other country, including Russia. The two warring factions within the ruling elite, which fight primarily over the spoils of power while abjectly serving corporate interests, peddle alternative realities. If the deep state and Venezuelan socialists or Russia intelligence operatives are pulling the strings no one in power is accountable for the rage and alienation caused by the social inequality, the unassailability of corporate power, the legalized bribery that defines our political process, the endless wars, austerity and de-industrialization. The social breakdown is, instead, the fault of shadowy phantom enemies manipulating groups such as blacklivesmatter s or the Green Party. “The people who run this country have run out of workable myths with which to distract the public, and in a moment of extreme crisis have chosen to stoke civil war and defame the rest of us – black and white – rather than admit to a generation of corruption, betrayal, and mismanagement,”Matt Taibbi writes. These fictional narratives are dangerous. They erode the credibility of democratic institutions and electoral politics. They posit that news and facts are no longer true or false. Information is accepted or discarded based on whether it hurts or promotes one faction over another. While outlets such as Fox News have always existed as an arm of the republicanparty , this partisanship has now infected nearly all news organizations, including publications such as the New York Times and the Washington Post,along with the major tech platforms that disseminate information and news. A fragmented public with no common narrative believes whatever it wants to believe. I first assumed this job posting from the New York Times for a Moscowcorrespondentwas a parody posted by the Onion. It wasn’t. It speaks volumes about the self-immolation of the New York Times and the press. JOB DESCRIPTION:Vladimir Putin’s Russia remains one of the biggest stories in the world. It sends out hit squads armed with nerve agents against its enemies, most recently the opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. It has its cyber agents sow chaos and disharmony in the West to tarnish its democratic systems, while promoting its faux version of democracy. It has deployed private military contractors around the globe to secretly spread its influence. At home, its hospitals are filling up fast with Covid patients as its president hides out in his villa. If that sounds like a place you want to cover, then we have good news: We will have an opening for a new correspondent as Andy Higgins takes over as our next Eastern Europe Bureau Chief early next year. Of course, every charge leveled here against Russia regarding foreign interference can be leveled in spades against the United States, both in the present and past, and even the implied criticism of its pandemic response seems like a textbook case of projection. More to the point, why should the Times even send someone to Moscow to report on what Russians think, feel and how they view themselves and the world if they have already decided they are a cartoon villain? Why have a Moscow bureau at all? A parody response circulating on the internet imagined a parallel posting byPravdafor a US correspondent: JOB DESCRIPTION:Donald Trump’s America remains one of the biggest stories in the world. It sends out its armies, its drones, and its agents around the world to kill its enemies. It has its cyber agents sow chaos and disharmony, undermining and overthrowing regimes, while promoting its faux version of democracy. It has deployed private military contractors around the globe to secretly spread its influence. At home, its hospitals are filling up fast with Covid patients as its president hides out on the golf course. If that sounds like a place you want to cover, then we have good news. We will have an opening for a new correspondent. I was a foreign correspondent for twenty years, fifteen of them with the New York Times. My job was to become bicultural, which requires hundreds of hours of language classes, to see the world from the perspective of those I covered and reflect it back to an American audience. But this type of reporting is now anachronistic.The paper might as well rehire the con artistJayson Blairto sit in his apartment and snort coke while filing fictional variants on the preordained narrative the paper demands. Or maybe computer algorithms can do the job. I guess I should not be surprised. After all, it was the Times that produced a ten-part podcast by its reporter Rukmini Callimachi based on interviews with a Muslim identified as Abu Huzayfah al-Kanadi who claimed to have been a member of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in the Middle East. He provided lurid accounts of murders and crucifixions he supposedly carried out. His stories, catering to the rampant Islamophobia that poisons American society, were the audio version of snuff films. They were also a lie. The Canadian“Abu Huzayfah,”whose real name was Shehroze Chaudhry, was arrested in September 2020 by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and charged under Canadian hoax laws for fabricating his story. The flagrant partisanship and discrediting of truth across the political spectrum are swiftly fueling the rise of an authoritarian state. The credibility of democratic institutions and electoral politics, already deeply corrupted by PACs, the electoral college, lobbyists, the disenfranchisement of third-party candidates, gerrymandering and voter suppression, is being eviscerated. Silicon Valley billionaires, including Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, donated more than $100 million to a Democratic super PAC that created a torrent of anti-Trump TV ads in the final weeks of the campaign to elect Biden. The heavy infusion of corporate money to support Biden wasn’t done to protect democracy. It was done because these corporations and billionaires know a Biden administration will serve their interests. The press, meanwhile, has largely given up on journalism. It has retreated into competing echo chambers that only speak to true believers. This catering exclusively to one demographic, which it sets against another demographic, is commercially profitable. But it also guarantees the balkanization of the United States and edges us closer and closer to fratricide. When Trump leaves the White House millions of his enraged supporters, hermetically sealed inside hyperventilating media platforms that feed back to them their rage and hate, will see the vote as fraudulent, the political system as rigged, and the establishment press as propaganda. They will target, I fear, through violence, the democraticparty politicians, mainstream media outlets and those they demonize as conspiratorial members of the deep state, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci. The democraticparty is as much to blame for this disintegration as Trump and the republicanparty . The election of Biden is also very bad news for journalists such as Matt Taibbi, Glen Ford, Margaret Kimberley, Glenn Greenwald, Jeffrey St. Clair or Robert Scheer who refuse to be courtiers to the ruling elites. Journalists that do not spew the approved narrative of the right-wing, or, alternatively, the approved narrative of the democraticparty , have a credibility the ruling elite fears. The worse things get – and they will get worse as the pandemic leaves hundreds of thousands dead and thrusts millions of Americans into severe economic distress – the more those who seek to hold the ruling elites, and in particular the democraticparty , accountable will be targeted and censored in ways familiar to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, now in a London prison and facing possible extradition to the United States and life imprisonment. Barack Obama’s assault on civil liberties, which included the repeated misuse of the Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowers, the passage of Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to permit the military to act as a domestic police force and the ordering of the assassination of US citizens deemed to be terrorists in Yemen, was far worse than those of George W. Bush. Biden’s assault on civil liberties, I suspect, will surpass those of the Obama administration. The censorship was heavy-handed during the campaign. Digital media platforms, including Google, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, along with the establishment press worked shamelessly as propaganda arms for the Biden campaign. They were determined not to make the“mistake”they made in 2016 when they reported on the damaging emails, released by WikiLeaks, from Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. Although the emails were genuine, papers such as the New York Times routinely refer to the Podesta emails as“disinformation.”This, no doubt, pleases its readership, 91 percent of whom identify as Democrats according to the Pew Research Center. But it is another example of journalistic malfeasance. Following the election of Trump, the media outlets that cater to a democraticparty readership made amends. The New York Times was one of the principal platforms that amplified Russiagate conspiracies, most of which turned out to be false. At the same time, the paper largely ignored the plight of the disposed working class that supported Trump. When the Russiagate story collapsed, the paper pivoted to focus on race, embodied in the 1619 Project. The root cause of social disintegration – the neoliberal order, austerity and deindustrialization – was ignored since naming it would alienate the paper’s corporate advertisers and the elites on whom the paper depends for access. Once the 2020 election started, the New York Times and other mainstream outlets censored and discredited information that could hurt Biden, including a tape of him speaking with former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, which appears to be authentic. They gave credibility to any rumor, however spurious, which was unfavorable to Trump. Twitter and Facebook blocked access to a New York Post story about the emails allegedly found on Hunter Biden’s discarded laptop. Twitter locked the New York Post out of its own account for over a week. Glenn Greenwald, whose article on Hunter Biden was censored by his editors at the Intercept, which he helped found, resigned. He released the email exchanges with his editors over his article. Ignoring the textual evidence of censorship, editors and writers at the Intercept engaged in a public campaign of character assassination against Greenwald. This sordid behavior by self-identified progressive journalists is a page out of the Trump playbook and a sad commentary on the collapse of journalistic integrity. The censorship and manipulation of information was honed and perfected against WikiLeaks. When WikiLeaks tries to release information, it is hit with botnets or distributed denial of service attacks. Malware attacks WikiLeaks’ domain and website. The WikiLeaks site is routinely shut down or unable to serve its content to its readers. Attempts by WikiLeaks to hold press conferences see the audio distorted and the visual images corrupted. Links to WikiLeaks events are delayed or cut. Algorithms block the dissemination of WikiLeaks content. Hosting services, including Amazon, removed WikiLeaks from its servers. Assange, after releasing the Iraqi war logs, saw his bank accounts and credit cards frozen. WikiLeaks’ PayPal accounts were disabled to cut off donations. The Freedom of the Press Foundation in December 2017 closed down the anonymous funding channel to WikiLeaks which was set up to protect the anonymity of donors. A well-orchestrated smear campaign against Assange was amplified and given credibility by the mass media and filmmakers such as Alex Gibney. Assange and WikiLeaks were first. We are next. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told CNN during this campaign that Russian disinformation efforts are“more problematic”than in 2016. He warned that“this time around, the Russians have decided to cultivate US citizens as assets. They are attempting to try to spread their propaganda in the mainstream media.” This will be the official mantra of the democraticparty , a vicious red-baiting campaign without actual reds, especially as the country spirals out of control. The reason I have a show on Russia-funded RT America is the same reason Vaclav Havel could only be heard on the US-funded Voice of America during the communist control of Czechoslovakia. I did not choose to leave the mainstream media. I was pushed out. And once anyone is pushed out, the ruling elite is relentless about discrediting the few platforms left willing to give them, and the issues they raise, a hearing. “If the problem is ‘American citizens’ being cultivated as ‘assets’ trying to put ‘interference’ in the mainstream media, the logical next step is to start asking Internet platforms to shut down accounts belonging to any American journalist with the temerity to report material leaked by foreigners (the wrong foreigners, of course – it will continue to be okay to report things like the ‘black ledger’),”writesTaibbi, who has done some of the best reporting on the emerging censorship.“From Fox or the Daily Caller on the right, to left-leaning outlets like Consortium or the World Socialist Web Site, to writers like me even – we’re all now clearly in range of new speech restrictions, even if we stick to long-ago-established factual standards.” Taibbi argues that the precedent for overt censorship took place when the major digital platforms – Facebook, Twitter, Google, Spotify, YouTube – in a coordinated move blacklisted the right-wing talk show host Alex Jones. “Liberal America cheered,”Taibbi told me when I interviewed him for my show, On Contact : They said ‘Well this is a noxious figure. This is a great thing. Finally, someone’s taking action.’ What they didn’t realize is that we were trading an old system of speech regulation for a new one without any public discussion. You and I were raised in a system where you got punished for speech if you committed libel or slander or if there was imminent incitement to lawless action, right? That was the standard that the Supreme Court set, but that was done through litigation. There was an open process where you had a chance to rebut charges. That is all gone now. Now, basically there’s a handful of these tech distribution platforms that control how people get their media. They’ve been pressured by the Senate, which has called all of their CEOs in, and basically ordered them, ‘We need you to come up with a plan to prevent the sowing of discord and spreading of misinformation.’ This has finally come into fruition. You see a major reputable news organization like the New York Post – with a 200-year history – locked out of its own Twitter account. The story [Hunter Biden’s emails] has not been disproven. It’s not disinformation or misinformation. It’s been suppressed as it would be suppressed in a Third World country. It’s a remarkable historic moment. The danger is that we end up with a one-party informational system. There’s going to be approved dialogue and unapproved dialogue that you can only get through certain fringe avenues. That’s the problem. We let these companies get this monopolistic share of the distribution system. Now they’re exercising that power. In the Soviet Union the truth was passed, often hand to hand, in undergroundsamizdatdocuments, clandestine copies of news and literature banned by the state. The truth will endure. It will be heard by those who seek it out. It will expose the mendacity of the powerful, however hard it will be to obtain. Despotisms fear the truth. They know it is a mortal threat. If we remain determined to live in truth, no matter the cost, we have a chance. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"25 Nov, 2020","Wayne Dupree: Hey, Joe Biden, rejoining the Paris accord just because you hate Trump is stupid. Put America’s interests first","The international climate change agreement struck in the French capital in 2015 is not right for our country. It will harm the economy, put jobs at risk, and end with us facing blackouts like those California recently suffered. Wayne Dupreewas recently invited to the White House to talk to President Trump on messaging to the black community. He was named in Newsmax’s top 50 Influential African-American Republicans in 2017, and, in 2016, served as a board member of the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump. Before entering politics, he served for eight years in the US Air Force. His website is here:www.waynedupree.com. Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow The problem with liberals is that they can’t accept the idea that they might be wrong, especially when it comes to the Paris accord on climate change. During one of the presidential debates, President Trump made the statement that CO2 emissions were at theirlowestlevels in 67 years. The Washington Postfact-checkedhis earlier comments on the Paris agreement and said they required “more context.” The Post said something like, “while it’s true that CO2 emissions are at their lowest level, it was not the result of federal regulations, but was the result of market forces.” Basically, in the opinion of the Post, if the Fed isn’t regulating and forcing something to happen, then it doesn’t count. In Democratic eyes, it is not about what’s best for America; it’s about not admitting that Trump could do anything right, even though his intuition was correct on almost every foreign policy (Paris accord, Iran, NATO, Middle East, NAFTA, etc.) and domestic policy (energy independence, interest rates, manufacturing jobs, immigration, etc.) that he addressed. If egos were not more important than moving the country in the right direction, we’d be looking forward to four more years of prosperity rather than the mess we are heading for. What’s truly ironic about people like Joe Biden – basically DC-types who aren’t really ideological in the sense of left or right, but who are more part of the globalist elite – is that the people who he tried to most appeal to during the election, the ordinary working man and woman, are going to be the first ones hurt by his policies. Professionals, myself included, will go on. I ll continue to go to Costco and Whole Foods and live my relatively comfortable life. I am working to have job security, and my skills are immediately mobile, meaning if I don’t like where I live, I can easily pick up and move and start right back up. But I’m also not the norm. People who live in small towns and depend on local homegrown industries for their work and their domestic energy, don’t have these options. Of course, once they all learn to code, that problem will be fixed. Or so progressives would have us believe. The mentality of those who think we should rejoin the Paris accord is skewed. They think the other countries aren’t reaching their goals on reducing carbon emissions (the Paris Agreement target is to dramatically reduce carbon emissions so as to limit global warming to 1.5C) just because we are not funding it. The truth of the matter is that the result would be the same with our funding, but we would be paying them with a blank check. Unless the worst polluters start showing a reduction of carbon emissions, instead of the INCREASE China is planning through the building of more coal-fired power plants, the US should have nothing to do with this “throwing good money after bad” scheme. Let me continue to break it down. Democrats have always given away American taxpayers’ money to foreign countries. This is a major reason why those countries love Democrats – they pay them loads. What Democrats don’t understand is that having a better, stronger economy leads to people making more money, and affords the investment that leads to better technology, which people then buy, and which in turn then becomes cheaper. However, Democrats take a socialistic view that it takes a government to force these changes through, and they then can’t understand why it costs triple the free-market solution, and why people ultimately resent being treated like sheep and won’t follow the orders, etc. Look at California, for example. Since the 1950s, it’s had the worstrecordon pollution of just about any state (worst as in offensive), and its recent push to rely on renewable energy has been adisaster. Other states are cutting emissions without killing their people financially or having brown-outs. But the blind will remain so even when faced with reality. They don’t see things clearly and to be honest, I doubt they really wish to have a firm and informed grip on reality. Many will say that just because others are not doing their share, two wrongs don’t make it right, and we should align with those still trying to stick to the Paris agreement. That saying is true and we teach our children such phrases. But the US isn’t being or doing “wrong,” we’re still doing our part – we’re just doing it without a pack of deceivers who we must constantly financially subsidize. We’re helping without ruining what we’ve built, or tearing things apart just because we can do so. There is no logical reason to rejoin failed accords like Paris or on Iran just because you don’t like the person that (wisely, in my view) removed us from them, or to score points with people you view as political supporters and voters. We are a country of many, not a political party, and the US, its interests, and its people should and must stand first in line when presidents of whatever hue make decisions. Like this story?

"22 Nov, 2020","Reaction to Biden’s ‘win’ shows that leftists will never be happy, because they always want to play the victim","The civil war that continues on the left despite Joe Biden’s presumed election victory proves one thing – they will never be satisfied. That’s why it’s important that the right never capitulates to the mob. BySamantha Chang, a politics writer and financial editor based in New York City. Follow her on Twitter@Samantha_Chang Through their hair-trigger reliance on physical violence and emotional blackmail, today’s radical left has shown that it does not want cooperation; rather, it demands capitulation. That’s why the political right must stop bending the knee to left-wing mobs and should not cave to their incessant demands. Why? Because no concession will ever be enough for these race-hustling grievance-mongers. And right-wing appeasement only emboldens them to make even more unreasonable demands. Perhaps nothing demonstrates this more than theclashesbetween leftist activists and Joe Biden supporters in Washington, DC on November 7 — hours after the media crowned Biden the ‘winner’ of the contested US presidential election. When Biden supporters had gathered to celebrate their supposed victory at blacklivesmatter Plaza, blacklivesmatter and Antifa protesters crashed the event and demanded they stop partying. An angry black man yelled into a megaphone: “For all of you f***ng journalists, for all of you white liberals who have been celebrating, getting drunk off your asses about Biden winning this election, you are all a bunch of f***ng fools!” He continued: “Get your s**t together and keep this in mind! You are using this plaza as a tourist attraction. You are all acting like this is f**king Disney World! This is not f**king Disney World. You are all colonizing this place for your own benefit!” Basically, the message was that getting rid of President DonaldTrumpwas not enough, and that more needed to be done in order to usher in a Marxist revolution — a major goal of the far left. “For all of you f—ng journalists, for all of you white liberals who have been celebrating, getting drunk off your asses about Biden winning this election, you are all a bunch of f—ng fools!” blacklivesmatter -antifa group tries to crash Biden party outside White House.pic.twitter.com/j4yCc2iTpb Some 800 miles away in Wisconsin, blacklivesmatter activists clashed with Biden supporters at another ‘celebration rally.’ The violent confrontation spotlighted that while Democrats and the far-left faction of their party were allies against a common enemy (Trump), they are not friends. A vicious fight breaks out at a Biden celebration rally in Madison, Wisc. attended by blacklivesmatter . Video by@RebsBrannon:pic.twitter.com/J4DN3QMGQe As journalist Drew Hernandezobservedafter the events in Washington: “ blacklivesmatter condemns white Biden supporters for celebrating and invading blacklivesmatter Plaza. blacklivesmatter and Antifa hate Joe Biden, will the mainstream media cover that fact?” A day later in Portland, Oregon, Antifa thugsvandalizedseveral Biden campaign offices and spray-painted the words “F**k Biden!” on the walls. During the past four years, the mainstream media gleefully sowed division on the right by amplifying any dissent among Republicans. This was an orchestrated effort to undermine President Trump. In contrast, the press ignored or downplayed the ugly civil war brewing on the left to promote a public veneer of unity. But that façade of solidarity was an illusion. The carefully-choreographed image was shattered after the election, when the likes ofAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezdeflected the blame for the Democrats’ losses in key House races. And moderate Democrats (who comprise the majority of the Party) pointed the finger at radical leftists like AOC as the reason they lost so many seats in the House of Representatives. All this backbiting underscores that the left is deeplydivided. And that won’t change no matter what happens. Why? Because leftists are inherently miserable misanthropes who see themselves as victims of an unjust society. Multiple studies over the years support this contention. In 2018, for example areportpublished in the academic journal Social Psychological and Personality Science noted that conservatives say their lives are more meaningful than liberals. This followed a 2012 studypublishedin the Journal of Research in Personality which concluded that conservatives were happier than liberals. It noted that these findings replicated past research, including a 2009 Pewpollshowing that Republicans were happier than Democrats. Indeed, the Pew poll noted: “Ever since the General Social Survey first asked the question in 1972, Republicans have always been happier than Democrats.” Similarly, researchers have found women and men who lean to the political right are perceived to be better-looking thanleftists, according to a report that was published in the Journal of Public Economics. The study says this may have something to do with the victim mentality that characterizes liberals. Apparently, having a chronic chip on your shoulder, blaming others for your problems and thinking the world owes you something is not sexy. “Good-looking people are more likely to perceive the world as a just place, since they are treated better than others, achieve higher status, and are happier,” researchers explained. “A frequent reason for people to sympathize with the left is a perception of the world as unfair.” The study suggests there’s a circular cause-and-effect scenario at play. “A simple economic explanation of the appearance gap in favor of the right is that beautiful people earn more money,” the report posited. “And the more people earn, the more they are inclined to oppose redistribution — and arguably, to support, get active in, and represent — parties to the right.” Similarly, two studies in thejournalPolitics and the Life Sciences concluded that “more-attractive individuals are more likely to report higher levels of political efficacy, identify as conservative, and identify as Republican.” It explained that people who are more attractive are treated better by society, and therefore less angry. As a result, they tend to be happier, more confident, and do better in life because they have higher self-esteem. Generally, individuals who prioritize personal responsibility and self-sufficiency tend to lean politically to the right. In contrast, those who self-identify as underprivileged victims usually lean to the left. If you believe this research, the nonstop left-wingscreechingof today makes some disjointed sense. But it’s also a reminder that bending the knee to leftist tantrums is not the solution. Why? Because some people are never satisfied, so when you give them an inch, they think they’re the ruler.

"21 Nov, 2020",Trump supporters and blacklivesmatter protesters face off at ‘stop the steal’ rally in Atlanta (VIDEOS),"President Trump’s supporters turned the State Capitol in Atlanta into a sea of red, white and blue as they protested Georgia s recount. As tensions between them and left-wing counter-protesters rose, police dispersed the rally. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed off on his state’s mandatory hand recount of election results on Friday, certifying Joe Biden’s apparent win, but paving the way for the Trump campaign to push for a more thorough audit of the vote. Joe Biden apparently won the peach state by a razor-thin margin of just over 12,000 votes, but the Trump campaign insists that many of these votes were illegally cast. Waving American flags and ‘Make America Great Again’ banners, several hundred of Trump’s most loyal supporters gathered outside the State Capitol on Saturday, chanting“stop the steal,”a phrase that has become a rallying cry for conservatives who believe this year’s presidential election was rigged in favor of Biden. Stop the steal - Pro-Trump rally in#Atlantapic.twitter.com/feJhFO5kHi A smaller group of counter-protesters showed up. Masked and clad in black, they held signs declaring President Trump a“fascist,”and waved ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ flags.

Protesting outside the building on Thursday, Fuentesdeclared“they are trying to certify the result tomorrow so they can steal the election in Georgia and steal this entire thing.” Georgia’s recount did not certify ballot signatures against voter rolls, nor did it verify addresses on mail-in ballots. Though Kemp certified the results of the recount, Jenna Ellis – one of the Trump campaign’s lawyers – said afterwards that the campaign will continue to“pursue all legal options to ensure that only legal ballots are counted."" Among the discrepancies cited by the Trump campaign are the state’s unprecedentedly lowrejection rateof mail-in ballots,“improbable”marginsfor Biden found during the recount, and sworn witnessreportsof what appeared to be batches of machine-printed ballots in favor of the Democrat.

Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC Doxing is a practice on the internet that is described as posting the personal information of an individual on a public forum. Whenever this is done, it is usually used with the intent to intimidate. If this information is easily accessible by some nut job on the internet, you could see harassment, vandalism, and many other things done to make the life of the person miserable. It s a dirty tactic that actually falls under many states harassment and cyberstalking laws as illegal. Anytime that a political figure does something of the sort it should raise eyebrows.Abraham Aiyash, a Michigan State representative elect publicly named the neighborhood in which a member of the board of canvassers in Wayne County lived. This particular action came across as encouraging people to continue to dig in to this woman s personal information. The fact of the matter is that her neighborhood where she lives had zero things to do with the discussion at hand, and the only reason it was brought up was to try and intimidate her so that this soon to be representative could get what he wanted. This followed Republicans on the board demanding they be allowed  torescind their votesto certify the state’s election results over concerns about voter irregularities, claiming they had been pressured into complying. This is not the first time that someone on the left has done such a thing. blacklivesmatter activist, Shaun King, threatened to begin doxing members of a police departmentunless one officer who was involved in a shooting had his information personally disclosed by the police department. Years before that,CNN threatenedto do something similar to someone who posted a Trump meme that showed the network’s logo superimposed onto WWE supremo Vince McMahon’s face as he was beaten up by the president at WrestleMania 23. This sort of action tends to cascade, and can snowball out of control before you know it. I saw on Twitterpeople threatened to doxAiyash because of his actions. On the other side, his supporters began digging more into the background of the woman that he was trying to pressure. This cannot and should never become normal. This is political intimidation, point blank. Thankfully, the internet never forgets so these sorts of things will live on in people s memories. However, the behavior needs to be called out for being as evil as it is. On top of that, there needs to be legal consequences as well. Charges need to be filed, civil suits need to be filed as well and debts to society need to be paid. Political parties need to call it out, especially those who have members that are participating in this behavior. This comes across like something the Cosa Nostra would do in a mob film. Right now people in politics need to do a bit of soul searching, because the chilling effect here is incredibly frightening. If nothing is done about this kind of behavior we are looking at a future where political intimidation will become the norm. Whether it s a protester, a news network, or a government official, evil is still evil. Such intimidation needs to be shunned and punished or we risk our governments becoming the mob.

"19 Nov, 2020","Biden’s ‘beholden to big money & defense industries,’ but pressure on him to heed progressive agenda’ – Sanders’ brother to RT","While probably “less aggressively nasty” than Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden is still a “conventional politician,” but it won t be easy for him to dismiss his party’s progressive wing, Larry Sanders told RT’s Going Underground. Brother to US Senator Bernie Sanders and the Green Party Spokesperson on Health and Social Care (England & Wales), Larry Sanders told RT’s Going Underground host Afshin Rattansi that while Biden was not his“choice”for president, he prefers him over the current incumbent, President Donald Trump. Trump’s opponents have long sounded the alarm that he might unleash the full power of the US military on protesters, as blacklivesmatter rallies against police brutality increasingly descended into violence in the months leading up to the November elections. Sanders echoed the sentiment, saying such a scenario would have been“an incredible step back”and arguing that it“may happen yet.” While the Trump campaign alleges election fraud, filing legal challenges with election officials all over the country, Sanders argued the US election result was a done deal, and that Biden emerged as the winner. However, he noted that Trump continues to wield immense political clout. “Trump is a very powerful figure in American politics, even though he is lost,”he said. Speaking about the democraticparty ’s treatment of his brother, Sanders said that, unlike during the 2016 race, the establishment acted in a more civil manner when rallying behind their preferred candidate this time around. But the nature of the party didn’t change, he argued. Biden is, on the face of it, is probably a little bit less aggressively nasty than Clinton, but the crucial thing is not those campaign oppositions, the crucial thing is that a large chunk of the democraticparty is a very right-wing party and it operates in that fashion. As a fixture of the establishment, Biden will follow the interests of corporate money and the military-industrial complex rather than anybody else’s, Sanders noted. “Biden is a conventional politician, he is beholden to big money, he is beholden to defense industries, he is in favor of fracking, there’s no reason to think of him as an essentially Green President,”Sanders explained. He argued, however, that there is“pressure”for Biden to follow the blueprint for his presidency unveiled in a report from a joint Biden-Sanders task force in July. The document reflects progressive policies of the Vermont Senator and those of his supporters, including on climate, health care and social security. He can disregard Bernard, he can disregard the left, he can disregard the Greens to an extent, but there is power there, and that means AOC can point not just to science and her own opinions, and to Bernard’s, but she could point to an agreement that was signed up to.

"18 Nov, 2020","Trump won, regardless of the election outcome… because Trumpism is here to stay","No matter the eventual election result, President Donald Trump’s legacy is intact. He has reignited an enthusiasm for nationalism the world over, but his true impact has been obscured by ridiculous accusations of racism. BySamantha Chang, a politics writer and financial editor based in New York City. Follow her on Twitter@Samantha_Chang As the fate of the US presidential election hangs in the balance pending resolution of multiple voter-fraudlawsuits, President Donald Trump has already won – no matter who takes the White House. Trump’s enduring legacy is the populist, nationalist movement he ignited in 2016. This coalition is growing by the day – both in the US and abroad – and will continue to expand, long after he leaves office. Why? Because “nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come,” as French author Victor Hugo eloquently noted. That idea is populist nationalism. The mainstream media (which is predominantly left-wing) has rabidly attacked nationalism and populism as “racist.” In reality, there is nothing racist about being proud of who you are and where you come from. This is why Trump supporters enthusiastically wave American flags at their gatherings, which are celebrations of their country. Similarly, countless patriots in other countries support Trump because as the US president, he boldly declared that it’s OK to be proud of your nation. Being a patriot does not mean you don’t like other countries. It means you respect the sovereignty of each nation and acknowledge that they have as much right to be proud of who they are as you do for who you are. For decades, Western nations were taught to be ashamed of their histories, claiming they were “racist.” In contrast, such self-hatred was not espoused in the Middle East, Asia or Africa, even though those regions arguably have more blatant histories ofovertracism. President Trump was voted into office in 2016 by a movement that championed everyday Americans – not the snobby, elitist groupthink embraced by the Washington swamp and Hollywood celebrities. Trump supporters were disgusted at America’s decades-long submission to a globalist agenda that taught that all white people are racist, all people of color are helpless victims and everyone should depend on the government to solve their problems. This flawed, race-hustling mindset stoked widespread racial animus, leading to the rise of the militant, anti-white, anti-police blacklivesmatter movement. The media breathlessly blamed Trump for the blacklivesmatter race riots that erupted across the US this summer, as if they happened because he was president. In reality, this racial division was brewing for decades; Trump was merely the catalyst that exposed the volcanic fury bubbling below the surface. The media have championed blacklivesmatter ’s destructive riots while deriding white people as racists if they dared to question blacklivesmatter ’s Marxist agenda. But numerous black commentators say the racial resentment goes both ways. Just ask attorney and political scientist Dr. Carol Swain. Swain says the nationalist movement in America started gaining momentum 15 years before Trump became president. She predicted the rise of nationalism in her 2002 book, ‘The New White Nationalism in America’. “The rise of the new white nationalism occurred long before the election of President Donald Trump,” Swain told Judge Jeanine Pirro. Swain noted that “white nationalism” is different from “white supremacy,” even though the left and their media lapdogs intentionally conflate the two movements. “I distinguish it from white supremacy because the people who were involved [in the white nationalism movement] were more intellectual,”saidSwain, a graduate of Yale Law School. She continued, “They were not espousing racial violence or using epithets, but they had grievances. They felt that white people’s rights were being trampled on and no one was speaking up or listening to their grievances.” Swain said the white nationalism movement mushroomed, because whites were being marginalized and disenfranchised after decades of affirmative action and other government programs designed to benefit minorities. The media and academia exacerbated the situation by constantly browbeating all white people as racist and claiming they have no right to complain about anything because they have ‘white privilege.’ But look around you: There are plenty of poor, underprivileged whites. White nationalism is becoming heightened since whites will soon no longer be themajorityrace in the US. It makes you wonder: Once whites become a minority, will society allow them to constantly whine and demand preferential treatment? But this is a narrative you’ll struggle to hear amid the cacophony of anti-Trump noise we are constantly subjected to. It’s also why these very real changes in America’s political landscape, all influenced by Trump, will be underplayed. The media’s bias has been exposed and its credibility decimated. According to a recent Gallup poll, a whopping 94 percent of Americans do nottrustthe press. Americans’ belief in the integrity of US elections has been reduced amid mounting evidence of alarmingirregularitiesand lack of transparency in vote-counting. The Democrat Party is splintered and acivil waris brewing. For example, Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), whose district voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said she will not support Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Bearing these in mind, it’s hard to argue that Trump truly lost – even though the election may eventually say otherwise. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"17 Nov, 2020",It’s not misogyny to point out Kamala Harris’ many failings… men and women alike should be fearful if she becomes president,"Corporate feminists are lumping in legitimate opposition to Democrat Vice President-elect Kamala Harris with an eruption of misogyny from the ‘Manosphere’. But it’s her indefensible policies that should really concern women. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram The ‘Manosphere’ – an ecosystem of blogs, message boards and Discord channels populated by unabashed male chauvinists who believe women shouldn’t even be voting, let alone serving in office – is terrified by the prospect of Kamala Harris becoming the US’ first female president. So says Jezebel, at least – the bible of corporate feminists and identity politics enthusiasts with two X chromosomes. The idea that Joe Biden, who turns 78 on Friday and would be the nation’s oldest-ever president if inaugurated in January, will be pushed to the side (or suffer further mental and physical deterioration) and Harris given the reins is framed inlast week’s articleas“part of a paranoid fantasy about gynocentric ‘pinkout’ of ‘femoid’ political control,”a testosterone-addled fever dream. Yet the possibility of Biden stepping aside to hand Harris control is hardly a conspiracy theory. In fact, it’s so mainstream it wasfloated by CNNin August, while Quartz wrote an entire articleplaying out the scenarioearlier this month. Many other establishment pundits have made no secret of their desire to see the old white neoliberal centrist step aside so a comparatively young mixed-race neoliberal centrist can take his place, and the candidate herself has been caught in a Freudian slipreferringto the coming “Harris-Biden administration.” The Manosphere’s crime, then, is seeing ‘Kamala’s technocracy’, ushered in under the cover of a rapidly sundowning Biden, as a negative. While this faction of internet misogynists represents only a tiny sliver of Harris detractors, Jezebel’s pearl-clutching outburst is part of what is sure to be a multi-pronged effort to tar all opposition to a Harris presidency as an outgrowth of this woman-hating swamp, whose tentacles have somehow managed to infect even the hapless progressives who think they’re opposing Harris for her policies. Poor things! Radicalized and they don’t even know it! Those policies, it must be said, merit fierce opposition. A Biden-Harris administration will have Americans locked down and masked up as soon as possible in the name of quashing Covid-19, even though the evidence that such draconian measures actually stop the spread of the novel coronavirus isflimsy at best(and one recent study suggested they actuallymake it worse). They have vowed to return to Barack Obama’s policy ofsupporting terroristsmasquerading as ‘pro-democracy’ forces in Syria while continuing Trump’s execrablesupportfor Israel’s human rights abuses. Biden has vowed toveto Medicare for All, while Harris has promised to enact strictgun controllaws – positions guaranteed to make the pair pariahs on both ends of the political spectrum. Harris campaigned on her record as California Attorney General, arecordriddled with prosecutorial misconduct, suppression of exonerating evidence, and outright sadism (how else would one describe the practice of locking up mothers whose children skip school?). If anything, it’s her policies that are misogynist, not her detractors. She was so unpopular as a candidate, she dropped out before the primaries even started – yet we’re supposed to believe only woman-haters are disturbed by the idea she’ll be president someday? This tired old tactic of using protected characteristics to deflect criticism from a loathsome candidate has been deployed by the democraticparty for the last decade to varying degrees of success. In the eyes of the establishment, those who recoiled at 2016’s warmongering sociopath Hillary Clinton were motivated by misogyny, and voters who balked at Barack Obama’s ‘drone lives matter’ foreign policy were racist.It’s an easy way to force weak-minded liberals back into line – and shame their stronger-minded ideological comrades who refuse to back away from their principles. That Jezebel and its ilk aren’t also hammering at Harris detractors for also being racist is testament to the low regard in which the black community holds her. The notion that Harris represents the “sisterhood” and women must unite behind her against the bogeyman of internet misogyny is ludicrous given her record and the havoc she would wreak as commander-in-chief. She represents the worst kind of opportunism, a careerist whose ‘convictions’ (pun intended) change with the prevailing winds, who leveraged sex to get ahead in politics. Should Biden fall and Harris take over as president, it will be one small step forward for one woman, and a giant leap backward for womankind. Think your friends would be interested?

"15 Nov, 2020","Escape from New York: 300,000 households flee as lockdowns & surging crime sour residents","Roughly 300,000 households have moved out of New York City since March, fleeing a metropolis that has become a land of lockdowns and rising violent crime in a year dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and civil unrest. US Postal Servicedataobtained by the New York Post showed that there were more than 295,000 change-of-address requests filed by residents moving out of the city s five boroughs from March 1 through October 31. The data included only moves to counties with 11 or more forwarding requests filed, meaning relocations to places where 10 or fewer New Yorkers moved during the period weren t counted. Each change-of-address request typically covers a whole household, not just an individual, so the number of people moving would be higher than the number of filings. There were nearly 245,000 moving notices filed with the Postal Service in March-July alone, the Post said, up from 101,000 a year earlier. The exodus has been blamed on Covid-19 concerns, economic woes, rising crime and troubled schools. New York state has suffered more than 33,000 Covid-19 deaths, the most in the nation, and more than 24,000 were in New York City. The city has had some of the most stringent economic lockdowns in the country to deter the spread of the virus, leading to thousands of restaurants, shops and other firms going out of business. New York is also among many large US cities that have been rocked by blacklivesmatter protests and violent Antifa riots and looting in the aftermath of George Floyd s death in Minneapolis police custody in May. A Manhattan Institutepolltaken from July 13 to August 3 showed that 44 percent of New Yorkers who make more than $100,000 annually had considered moving out of the city since March. Nearly two-thirds said they believed present conditions were a “new normal” for the city. Respondents said their quality of life had deteriorated, and their satisfaction with the city dropped by half. The law of supply and demand also illustrates the growing desire to get out of New York City. To rent a 20-foot U-Haul truck on December 4 to move from New York to Nashville, Tennessee, would cost $2,153,accordingto the company s website. To make the same move in reverse on the same date, the truck rental would cost $677, or less than one-third the rate to leave New York. As for violent crime, there were 344murdersin New York from January through September, exceeding the total of 335 for all of 2019 with three months still remaining to go in 2020. The number of shootings has risen 94 percent. The Post said most of the forwarding addresses are in nearby locales, such as New Jersey and neighboring New York counties. But more than 13,000 households moved to three counties in Florida, and nearly 9,000 redirected their mail to Los Angeles. Governor Andrew Cuomo s efforts to urge wealthy New Yorkers tomove backto the city apparently have had little effect. More than 16,000 Manhattan apartments sat vacant as of October, the most in 14 years. Cuomo announced new Covid-19 restrictions on Wednesday, prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people in homes and requiring restaurants and bars to close by 10pm.

"15 Nov, 2020",Sharing political opinions now ‘irresponsible’: Woke mob demands Disney sack Gina Carano after ‘Mandalorian’ star mocks Democrats,"‘The Mandalorian’ star Gina Carano has caused a full-blown Twitter meltdown after sharing a meme claiming that the democraticparty is trying to swindle Americans, causing #FireGinaCarano to trend on the platform. The image, which shows two men placing face masks over their eyes, reads:“Democratic government leaders now recommends (sic) we all wear blindfolds along with masks so we can’t see what’s really going on.” pic.twitter.com/yJnnKVjume The outspoken MMA-fighter-turned-actress has been in the crosshairs of the PC police for days after publiclydoubtingthe integrity of the 2020 election results. But the meme in question appears to have been the last straw for many internet guardians of righteousness, and by Saturday night #FireGinaCarano was trending in the United States. Dozens of armchair warriors rehashed their old grievances with the actress, recycling claims that she was“transphobic”because she listed“boop/bop/beep”as her“pronouns”in her Twitter bio. Many others accused her of racism for liking tweets from conservative pundits. Disney fired James Gunn because of bad jokes on Twitter dug up by a rapist, but Gina Carano is regularly tweeting out transphobic hate. Disney,#FireGinaCarano Gina Carano actively promotes hateful, bigoted views, has tweeted misinformation +conspiracies about the American election, doesn t support wearing masks/treats COVID like a hoax, liked tweets about shooting protesters... this woman is not part of the Rebellion#FireGinaCaranopic.twitter.com/4u52pqI3vo Others stopped short of calling for her to lose her job but still said that Carano was being“irresponsible”by sharing her political views. Woah, Gina this is extremely irresponsible. If you are referring to the election, there is no proof of any fraud. If you at referring to mask wearing, we should be doing that and if we all did it we would be able to go outside sooner. Not everyone was critical of the actress, however. Numerous Twitter users argued that the vitriolic comments and hashtags were unwarranted. “Why people think you can’t have a differing opinion is beyond me. Keep up the fight,”notedonecomment. Others scoffed at efforts to“cancel”Carano over a joke. In before they try to cancel Gina again all over a joke. Stand strong Gina! 👊 The actress is no stranger to online controversy. In August, she was the target of another vindictive hashtag, #GinaCaranoIsOverParty, after she was accused of blocking accounts that supported blacklivesmatter . She claimed that blacklivesmatter activists had been bullying her into expressing solidarity with the controversial protest movement. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"15 Nov, 2020","As governments seek to make photographing police a crime, our art puts them back in the frame & accountable for their actions","A draconian bill outlawing the dissemination of images of police officers will be debated in the French parliament next week. It follows similar moves in Spain and elsewhere. We must fight these new restrictions. Democraciaare a Spanish-based collective using art as a tool to make propaganda. Their exhibition, We Protect You From Yourselves, is currently at Biennale Warsaw, presented bya/political. 2020 has been a year of ever increasing state-sanctioned violence. In the UK the new Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill, currently being rushed through parliament, willallowundercover agents to commit ‘murder, torture and rape’ in the name of queen and country. From Madrid to London and Warsaw, our work asks what freedoms are stolen in the name of government control. Under the pretext of public safety, in late 2014 the Spanish parliament passed the Basic Law for the Protection of PublicSecurity. Despite strong opposition and condemnation, this new legislation revoked civil liberties including the right to peaceful assembly. As a direct consequence of these laws, we were prosecuted for 18 Portraits, a series of photographs of riot-police during the anti-austerity Rodea el Congreso rally in September 2012 in Madrid. We were handed a fine of €600,000 and risked three years in prison. The case was the first of its kind to target individuals rather than corporations, in a bid to intimidate and terrorize, and restrict acts of creative freedom classed as antagonistic to the official line. The case dragged on while we anticipated bankruptcy and imprisonment. It finally ended only when we proved our motives were artistic and not criminal. We walked away as supposedly free citizens, though we can still be prosecuted if we exhibit these works again in Spain, and the law remains in place. It is the same type of legislation that will be presented at the Assemblée Nationale in France next week, whereby anyone could be imprisoned for a year or face €45,000 fine for“disseminating by any means or medium whatsoever, with the aim or harming their physical or psychological integrity, the image of the face or any other identifying element of an officer of the national police or member of the national gendarmerie when engaged in a police operation”. Not only does this have extraordinary implications for journalists, the accountability we see as a result of photographs and videos taken by civilians on their mobiles of police misconduct will all but disappear. We Protect You From Yourselvesis a series of works we produced using the image and voices of the police to present their contradictory role in society both as protectors and aggressors. We are currently exhibiting the series at the Biennale Warszawa in Poland against a backdrop of right-wing marches and anti-abortion protests. But the escalating abuse of power by the ‘guardians of civil liberties’ can be seen throughout the world. Only this year the world watched a video of a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd for eight minutes and forty seven seconds, killing him. We’ve seen security forces indiscriminately attacking protestors, journalists and medics at the ensuing blacklivesmatter demonstrations. And protesters being kidnapped from the street by masked men in Belarus and Nigeria’s SARS squad torturing and killing the opposition. Our art is putting the police back in the frame – making them visible and accountable for their actions. The mechanisms of power are manifest both in plain sight and purposely obscured in an effort to maintain control. Our exhibition asks what should be done to counteract this force. In Houston, Texas, we collaborated with the Huey P Newton Gun Club for an ‘open carry’ demonstration on the streets. They were armed, engaged and vocalising the names of comrades who have died at the hands of the police. These individuals embody the resistance – prepared to defend their liberties with the same strategies the police use to ‘protect’ us. While the portraits of the Huey P Newton Gun club members were consensual and those of the police were not, we present both with the same objectivity that questions who really should be in control of our ownprotection. Some civilians who fight for our rights are brave enough to show their faces. Unfortunately, those who are hired to maintain social order by the state are protected by a power that is as insidious as it is obscure. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"14 Nov, 2020","Candace Owens backs Trump to remain in White House, hints she might run for president in 2024","Conservative activist Candace Owens has backed Donald Trump to overcome his current electoral predicament and retain the US presidency. The outspoken commentator also hinted that she might run as his “successor” in 2024. Owens made the comments in response to a tweet from boxer Devon Alexander, mocking her career. The pugilist shared a message from Owens in which she said that Democrat Joe Biden is“not the president-elect,”despite the latest projections giving Biden 306 electoral votes to Trump s 232. 2024 is a long way off...Maybe I’ll run as his successor.https://t.co/GviudBTDeZ “What s going to happen to this one after Trump is out of office,”Alexander quipped, along with a series of laughing emojis. Never short of words, Owens responded:“2024 is a long way off... Maybe I’ll run as his successor.” The 31-year-old has been a vocal critic of the blacklivesmatter movement and is the founder of the BLEXIT group, which calls for black Americans to “exit” the democraticparty . Owens’ comments were met with glee by her fans, who enthusiastically expressed their support for the conservative pundit. Many pledged to vote for Owens, while others offered to work as volunteers for her campaign. YES!!!!!! You’ve got my vote!!! You got my vote and I’ll work in your Rhode Island campaign office. Some even suggested Owens would make a good running mate for Ivanka Trump.

"14 Nov, 2020",F(und) the police: Minneapolis allocates $500k to hire cops from other departments amid officer shortage,"Minneapolis, ground zero for the continuing blacklivesmatter protests, has approved a plan to add more law enforcement personnel to the city’s police department for the remainder of 2020, allocating nearly $500,000 to the force. The decision was narrowly passed by the Minneapolis City Council in a 7-6 vote on Friday. The city has allocated $496,800 to bring 20 to 40 additional officers from Hennepin County Sheriff s Office and Metro Transit, who will be helping the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) from November 15 till the end of the year. The idea to bring in reinforcements was floated by the city’s police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who revealed that nearly 500 people have been wounded by gunfire so far this year throughout the city. “Our resources are hemorrhaging,”Arradondo told the city council on Tuesday. Our city is bleeding at this moment. I m trying to do all I can to stop that bleeding and I m hoping that, having the funds to launch a citywide joint enforcement team initiative, we can try to stop the bleeding in our city. The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, admitted that the police force has faced a mass exodus of officers, with retirement rates growing more than twofold this year. “On an annual basis we see somewhere in the range of 40 to 45 officers retire or resign,”Frey said.“Now, those numbers are well beyond 100. And it does have an impact.” Apart from that, some 100 more officers are on paid leave and are not actually partaking in active duty, according to the city’s officials. On top of the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, the city has also faced an“intolerable level of gun violence and crime,”the mayor stated. The city has experienced a spike in homicides, with some 75 people killed so far this year. Other violent crime, such as robberies and carjacking, is on the rise as well, with more than 4,600 incidents registered – a five-year high. Minneapolis has become ground zero for the blacklivesmatter protests that have been gripping the US for several months. In many cities across the country, the protests have repeatedly spiraled into rioting, with violence, arson, and widespread looting. The protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old man who perished at the hands of Minneapolis police during a brutal arrest late in May. The incident has reinvigorated the drive against police brutality, resulting in bans on the use of riot control equipment in several cities. It also sparked the“defund the police”movement, proponents of which believe law enforcement departments should be stripped of a large chunk of their budgets, which should then be re-allocated to“community”projects.

Theoldest-living war criminal– Kissinger, not Biden – has made clear his preference for the oldest living senator (Biden claimed during the campaign he d been in the Senate for 180 years) and perhaps come January the oldest ever president to take the oath. You may not share my religious beliefs, but I consider the continued sulphurous presence of Henry K proof of Satan s existence on Earth. To my mind, no man since Hitler has more blood on his hands than Kissinger. But I must declare an interest. Kissinger has killed a lot of friends of mine, beginning inChile in 1973. He killed a lot of children who look like my children, inVietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. And he is apersonal role model of Tony Blair,to whose incarceration for war crimes and crimes against humanity my own life is now dedicated. From thekilling fields of Indo-China, through the years of living dangerously inSuharto s Indonesia, to the ruins ofLa Monedaand corpse ofSalvador Allende, and to the ghost city ofQuneitrain Syria. There is, in fact, no operating theatre of bloody colonialism since the 1960s in which he hasn t been so steeped in blood that a commemorative statue wouldn t have been in order. And he s backed Biden. The “vulgarity” of Donald J. Trump was just TOO much for Henry K. ToBusiness Insider,“the most famous Secretary of State the US has had” revealed “I like Joe Biden,” whom he described as “thoughtful and moderate.” Just like himself, in fact. When Biden bombs it will be with regret rather than relish. They will be humanitarian bombs, just likeBarack O Bomber s were. That there will be rather more of them, and in fresh countries too, is something, dear reader, you will have to prepare yourself for. There will be no “Muslim ban,” just the continuation of Muslim-bombing. Including a resumption of Muslim-bombing in the likes of Syria. But these bombers, at least, will be adorned with blacklivesmatter paraphernalia and maybe the rainbow flag painted on their tail-fins for good measure. No more coverage of “kids in cages,” but plenty of kids in coffins. FromYemen(a genocidal war begun by the Obama-Clinton-Biden gang) toIdlib(the dirty war started by the same gang, which spawned the death cult of ISIS). From the jungles ofVenezuelato conflicts yet unborn, Biden will be there with Hillary Clinton – thelaughing assassin of Gaddafi– and her witchesSusan Rice and Samantha Power, cackling as they stir the pot. Hubble bubble toil and trouble is the stew on the menu now, and old Mephistopheles Henry Kissinger will be in all the selfies. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"13 Nov, 2020",Quality vs quota? Outcry as Mayor Sadiq Khan tells London police that 40% of new hires must be BAME,"London’s top cop has been told that 40 percent of new recruits must be from ethnic minority backgrounds as the city’s government looks to tackle allegations of racism and discrimination. The UK’s biggest police force has accepted plans to introduce a minimum quota for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) recruits. It is anticipated that Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, will unveil the new race action plan on Friday. The move is the result of long negotiations between the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Met police. Khantweeted:“There remains a great deal of work to do to unpick the conscious and unconscious bias and systemic racism that still exists in our public institutions and our society as a whole. Our Action Plan will introduce the biggest policing reforms seen in a generation.” London s police are the best in the world, but we must do more to improve Black Londoners trust and confidence in our police service, and ensure police powers don’t disproportionately impact them. That s why@MetPoliceUKand I are taking action: 1/2pic.twitter.com/9h5XIqwmjJ London’s police force has the most BAME officers in the UK but still underrepresents the vast ethnic minority community in the British capital. Currently, 40 percent of London’s population is BAME, while only 15.4 percent of the Met’s officers are of BAME backgrounds. In 2019, the Met’s head of human resources, Clare Davies, told reporters that“it would take over 100 years to be representative of London.” While some people showed their support for the race action plan, the initiative has been condemned on Twitter.Some slammed Khan’s scheme, with one user questioning whether it is a ‘form of racism’ itself and whether there could be a positive outcome. Isn t this a form of racism itself? Affirmative action of some sorts? Don t need to look further than South Africa to see the outcome of that...@SadiqKhan@BorisJohnson Another user was disappointed not to see employment offered on the basis on merit. Not those with the right skills then. Just the right ethnicity. Something wrong with the met. Some lamented the initiative, claiming that diversity always comes down to quotas and saying“Quality doesn t matter.” Quality doesn’t matter. In the end diversity is all about quotas.https://t.co/MmoXs5OLDw Many were keen to point out that more than 87% of the UK population is white despite a high BAME population in the capital and notably its Eastern districts. Despite the country being approx 80% white?#positivediscriminationhttps://t.co/XDZG9UbyDv Meanwhile, some praised the initiative. Labour Councilor Judith Garfield claimed that other cities should take note. @SadiqKhan’s Action Plan will improve trust in policing and ultimately help to keep Londoners safe.This level of investment in training and community engagement is unmatched - other cities should take notehttps://t.co/xQTJTuem3q Previous attempts to introduce more diversity on the frontline of London’s police force have failed. The Met police saw a considerable drop in the number of BAME candidates applying to join the force and passing its competency-based questionnaire during its 2013 recruitment campaign. The Met police have come under pressure in 2020, a year of protracted civil rights campaigning and mass blacklivesmatter protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of US cops in May. Protests were organized in at least 260 locations around Britain. A number of monuments linked to the UK’s colonial past were also targeted by the blacklivesmatter protesters, and in some places, clashes broke out between protesters and right-wing groups who claimed they wanted to protect the statues. A study by the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), a group that monitors public order policing, identified“excessive use of force and the disproportionate targeting of black protesters,”during blacklivesmatter demonstrations in May and June. London’s police force has frequently been the target of protests and campaigns, with demonstrators accusing officers of racial profiling. Reports show that black people are six times more likely than white people to be stopped by police when driving. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"10 Nov, 2020",France’s bold stand for Charlie Hebdo liberty shames the cowardly UK & US cultural elites as they postpone a race-issue exhibition,"As the bodies pile up in France’s defence of freedom of speech, imagined criticism from the blacklivesmatter movement has seen both British and American galleries put on hold a timely art show in case it upsets people. As a consequence of its unbending defence of freedom of speech, France remains on high alert, fearful of terrorist murderers who disagree with it. Meanwhile, in the UK and the US, we sleep more soundly in our beds by refusing to make such hard choices – and the cowardice this exposes at the heart of our cultural establishment shames us all. While President EmmanuelMacronhas bravely held the line to defend French liberty in the face of the unspeakable horrors wrought upon his citizens by rabid Islamists who object to the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed – first in satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and now in a wider environment, as other French publications rally to the cause – the cowardly curators of a scheduled UK and US tour of the works of Canadian-American painter Philip Guston have have pulled the plug on the exhibition lest someone somewhere is upset. While the works were slated to appear at the Tate Modern gallery in London next February, organisers now say thatwon’t happenuntil at least 2023, if at all. Further showings in Boston, Houston, and Washington DC have also been postponed. To explain their patronising pandering to the woke brigade, in order to avoid any criticism whatsoever from them, the team of curators – who all happen to be white – issued a joint statement defending their decision. They hadagreedto delay the exhibition, they said, until, “a time at which we think that the powerful message of social and racial justice that is at the center of Philip Guston’s work can be more clearly interpreted.” Of course, in this gross display of over-protective hand-holding, they are referring to the sometimes heated discussion about race that has been had on both sides of the Atlantic since the start of 2020. Guston’s work is provocative, that’s undeniable, but that’s the whole point. His childlike depictions of Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan were prompted by his experience of the violence and civil unrest of the 1960s, which would have made a fresh look at his work exquisitely timed. Because, of course, we’ve just had a long taste of that violence and civil unrest ourselves, and nowhere more so than in the US, with blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) marches clashing with right-wing opposition, commentators tearing scabs from historical wounds, armed police and anarchy on the streets across America, and the most divisive US elections in living memory, fer Chrissakes. This. Is. The. Time. But no. Nanny knows best. So Guston’s works will stay where they are until our cultural superiors decide we are ready to see them. It’s a pity the murdered editors from Charlie Hebdo had no say in that decision. To deny us this opportunity is an insult to those heroes of freedom by high-minded cultural guardians soaked in virtue signalling and giving off the stink of self-righteousness. They should be dismissed from their positions of privilege immediately and exiled from public life forever. We can understand that the more swivel-eyed adherents at the fringes of the blacklivesmatter movement might screech and wail at the sight of Guston’s childlike images depicting the artist – who’s been dead for 40 years – and others in the typical Ku Klux Klan garb of white sheet and pointed hood. But it’s not racist propaganda we’re looking at here; it’s an artist expressing a viewpoint about the upheaval of American society in the 60s, when the works were made. Isn’t the freedom to express a viewpoint what Charlie Hebdo’s decision to print caricatures of the Prophet Muhammed was all about? And look at the mayhem that bold decision has brought to the streets of France! Not only were a dozen people killed by evil terrorists Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, on January 7, 2015, after the magazine’s publication, but in the past two months, as the court case in Paris continues over the involvement of14 accomplices, not only have there have been a further four deaths in two separate Islamist incidents in which two victims were beheaded, but another two innocent people were stabbed outside Charlie Hebdo’s former offices. That blood was spilled in the name of freedom. And still, the French stand by their right to say whatever they please, even if that means offending people, and even if that means paying with their life. Yet in the cosy salons of the British and US cultural elite, unbelievably difficult choices such as this never have to be made. Because they are simply avoided, lest someone, somewhere, somehow take offence. The decision to delay the Guston exhibition has shone a light on the rarely spotted incestuous cliques of donors, patrons, artists, and gallery bosses who run these high-revenue travelling shows, revealing their real concern: protecting their own interests. All the while, they’re petrified of upsetting the woke brigade on social media – never mind the art, or the questions it asks of us all. And the French, in their bravery, must struggle to understand this humiliating display of abject cowardice. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"9 Nov, 2020",Slavoj Zizek: Biden’s win changes nothing and signifies stalemate that could see Trump run again in 2024,"Don’t expect Joe Biden’s election victory to make a major difference to the US. He will be hamstrung by the Senate and Supreme Court, and unable to impose any fundamental change. is a cultural philosopher. He’s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. is a cultural philosopher. He’s a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. ‘Democracy Reborn’, the title of a book from 2007 by the historian Garrett Epps, is used in US historiography to designate the time after the Civil War when all progressives joined forces to add Amendment XIV to the Constitution. This amendment provided African Americans with full citizenship and prohibited any state from denying any citizen equal protection under the law. It changed almost every detail of US public life, which is why some scholars even call it the ‘second constitution’. It was not a reconciliation between the winning North and the defeated South, but a new unity imposed by the winner, a big step forward towards universal emancipation. Did something similar not happen in Chile with the victory of APRUEBO in thereferendum? The process of changing the constitution approved by the large majority is not aimed exclusively at getting rid of the legacy of General Pinochet and a return to the pre-Pinochet ‘democratic’ era. It also wants to inaugurate a more radical change, a new level of emancipation. Here also, ‘democracy reborn’ is not a return to some old, idealized state, but a radical break with the entire past. In the era of Donald Trump, the USA was again de facto in a state of ideological-political civil war between the populist new right and the liberal-democratic center, with occasional threats of physical violence. Now that Trump’s authoritarian populism has been defeated, is there a chance for a new ‘democracy reborn’ in the USA? Unfortunately, this slim chance was lost with the marginalization of democratic socialists such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Only the alliance of left liberals with democratic socialists may have pushed the process of democratic emancipation a step further. What’s more, with the Senate remaining in the hands of the Republicans and the Supreme Court with a conservative majority, Biden as president will have very limited room for maneuver and will not be able to impose any serious change. This is exacerbated by the fact that Biden himself is a ‘moderate’ agent of the economic and political establishment, who is horrified at being accused of socialist tendencies. AOC was thus fully justified when, in a post-election interview, she broke the truce andcriticizedthe democraticparty for incompetence, warning that if the Biden administration does not put progressives in top positions, the party would lose big in the 2022 midterm elections. The US is now almost symmetrically divided, and Biden’s words of unity and reconciliation sound vacuous – as former US secretary of labor Robert Reichput it:“How can Biden heal America when Trump doesn’t want it healed?”And this division is here to stay. As academic Michael Goldfarbargued:“Trump was no accident. And the America that made him is still with us.” It is quite possible then, that in the same way the post-Civil-War ‘democracy reborn’ ended up with a compromise with anti-black southern democrats which prolonged anti-black racism for a whole century until the 1960s, something similar will happen after a couple of years of Biden reign. But the outcome of the elections is not just a stalemate – there is a clear winner: the big capital and deep state apparatus, from Google and Microsoft to the FBI and the National Security Agency. From their standpoint, a weak Biden presidency with the Senate in Republican hands is the best possible outcome. Without Trump’s eccentricities, international trade and political cooperation will get back to pre-Trump normality, while the Senate and Supreme Court will block any radical measures. The paradox is thus that, in the US, the victory of the ‘progressive’ side was at the same time its loss, signifying a political stalemate which may even give Trump a chance to return to power in 2024. This is why, precisely at the moment of Trump’s defeat, we should ask how he was able to seduce half of the American people. And one reason is undoubtedly an attribute that he shares with Bernie Sanders. Like Trump, Sanders inspires fierce loyalty among his supporters – as they say, once you go Bernie, you never go back. There is no mystic affection here, just a recognition that he really addresses them and their troubles, that he really understands them – in clear contrast to most of the other Democratic candidates. It’s not a matter of the feasibility of Sanders’ program, it is that he touches a raw nerve of his partisans. Could a voter worried about what will happen if – or, rather, when – someone in their family gets really sick, seriously claim that Michael Bloomberg or Biden really understands them? Here, Trump is superficially similar to Sanders. Although his solidarity with ordinary people is mostly limited to obscene vulgarities, he also addresses their everyday worries and fears in simple terms, giving the impression that he really cares for them and respects their dignity. One has to admit that, even in dealing with the pandemic, Trump cunningly adopted a ‘human’ approach: he tried to maintain calm, telling people that the epidemic will soon be over and that they can carry on with their lives. I once wrote that Biden is Trump with a human face, more civilized and kind. But one could also say the opposite: Trump is Biden with a human face, where, of course, ‘humanity’ is reduced to its minimum of common vulgarities and insults, in the same sense that a drunkard who babbles nonsense is more ‘human’ that an expert talking about complex formulas. Now we are at such a low point that getting a president who will not change anything is the most we can hope for. The only group that deserves to be celebrated as heroes are those who simply ignored the violent threats of Trump’s partisans and calmly went on with their job of counting votes. Such praise is usually reserved for ‘rogue states’ where a peaceful transfer of power is a cause for celebration. The only small hope is that an unintended result of the Trump era may survive: the partial withdrawal of the US from world politics. The US will have to accept that it is just another state in a new, multi-centric world. This is the only way for all of us to avoid the humiliating situation of following with fear the counting of the votes in the US, as if the fate of the entire world depends on a couple of thousand of American ignoramuses.

"9 Nov, 2020","Red, WHITE and Blue – Pundits blame support for Trump on ‘whiteness’, but what do they even mean?","Trump’s better-than-expected performance in the US election has confounded pollsters, and several left-wing commentators have suggested ‘whiteness’ was an important factor. But this concept doesn t make a great deal of sense. ByNoah Carl, an independent researcher based in the UK. Follow him on Twitter@NoahCarl90 Although it looks like Joe Biden has the 2020 election in the bag, Donald Trump certainly exceeded pollsters’ expectations. FiveThirtyEightsaidBiden would win Wisconsin by 8.3 points; he actually won it by only 0.7 points. The EconomistsaidTrump would win Ohio by only one point; he actually won it by 8.2 points. YouGovsaidBiden would win Florida by 4.3 points; he actually lost it by 3.3 points. As a result of these psephological blunders, numerous commentators have been caught off-guard by the results. They were expecting a ‘blue wave’, but what they got was a nail-biting finish, along with demands forrecountsfrom the Trump campaign. (I suspect many of these commentators assumed that the 2016 election was a one-off, and that after experiencing four years of Trump, the great majority of Americans – even those of a Republican disposition – would be quite ready to vote for another candidate. As it turns out, of course, they assumed wrong.) When faced with an unexpected outcome, a person’s natural instinct is to search for explanations. How could so many people have voted for Donald Trump… again?! One explanation that has been put forward by several left-wing commentators is ‘whiteness.’ On results day, Arne Duncan – who served as Secretary of Education under Barack Obama – tweeted, “We need to talk a lot less about red and blue. We need to talk a lot more about whiteness.” This particular observation earned him nearly 40,000 likes. Similarly, the filmmaker and activist Bree Newsomeurgedher followers“to study more about the development of race & whiteness as a sociopolitical construct in America to better understand why/how this is so deeply embedded in the culture.”Her tweet garnered more than 10,000 likes. When the writer Caitlin Flanagandissented, noting “The problem isn’t whiteness,” she was gainsaid by other users. As onetoldher, “no Caitlin it literally is whiteness.” The most straightforward rebuke of the claim that ‘whiteness’ explains Trump’s better-than-expected performance is that he appears to have done particularly well among non-white voters (who presumably have less ‘whiteness’). According to exitpolls, Trump won 26 percent of the non-white vote, a higher share than any Republican candidate since 1960. (And according to a largesurveycarried out in the days preceding the election, he won a slight majority of Native American votes.) One could also point out that the distribution of votes among whites was less skewed toward one of the two main parties than the distribution among non-whites. 57 percent of whites voted for Trump, whereas 72 percent of non-whites voted for Biden. Hence, if ‘whiteness’ explains Trump’s performance in the 2020 election, then ‘non-whiteness’ must explain Biden’s performance even better. Reading around a bit, however, one learns that ‘whiteness’ doesn’t simply refer to the actions of white people (in this case, turning out for Donald Trump in large numbers). What the term actually means is not entirely clear to me. But in the spirit of Arne Duncan’s tweet, I am here to talk more about it. According to a 2015 New York Timesarticletitled ‘What is Whiteness?’, the concept involves a “toggle between nothingness and awfulness”. A 2020articleof the same title, published in Psychology Today, defines ‘whiteness’ as an “unfairly privileged exclusionary category, based on physical features, most notably a lack of melanin.” And a 2018articlepublished in the New York Times describes it as a “real and alarming force,” while referring to “the darkness at the heart of whiteness” (which, you have to admit, is quite an amusing phrase). Further light is shed on the concept in a 2020 Guardianarticleby onenotedCambridge academic. ‘Whiteness’, we are told, is “a set of ideas and practices about race that has emerged from a bedrock of white supremacy.” This set of ideas may constitute an“ideology”, one which is able to “make itself invisible and thereby make its operations more lethal and harder to challenge.” Since ‘race’is“a way of creating power differentials,” the only way to achieve equality is by abolishing ‘whiteness,’ which serves as “the ideology at the top.” If – after those explanations – you’re still slightly confused as to what role ‘whiteness’ played in the 2020 election, I don’t blame you. To be charitable to the commentators who mentioned ‘whiteness,’ what they may have been trying to say is the following: Because Trump is a conservative who wants to put ‘America First’ and has opposed things like blacklivesmatter and critical race theory, he is seen (correctly or otherwise) as representing the group interests of white Americans. Therefore, the fact that so many white Americans turned out for him must mean that a large fraction of them were concerned about their group interests. While this may or may not be correct, it is at least an intelligible hypothesis. The real question then is why commentators decided to use the term ‘whiteness.’ And, in fact, the frequency with which that term appears in the New York Times and Washington Post has increaseddramaticallyover the last few years. One possibility is that the term functions as a signal of one’s membership in the ‘anti-racist’ faction of politics (and hence that one subscribes to certain fashionabletheoriesabout the causes of racial inequality). Another is that it serves todifferentiateoneself from lower-status members of society, who are not well-versed in the latest critical race theory jargon. A third possibility is that, being sufficiently vague and abstruse, it allows the speaker toappearas if he is saying something profound when he is in fact making a rather banal observation. While concerns about group interests may have motivated some white people to vote for Donald Trump (and may have motivated some non-white people to vote for Joe Biden), it is difficult to see how the concept of ‘whiteness’ adds anything to this discussion. Ironically enough, ‘whiteness’ seems designed to obscure, rather than to illuminate. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"9 Nov, 2020","Antifa says ‘No Presidents’: Portland Democrat building defaced with ‘F**k Biden,’ ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ and ‘ACAB’ graffiti (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)","Unrest on the streets of Portland continued over the weekend, with multiple arrests, the use of tear gas, and one local Democrat party office defaced with anti-government graffiti, including ‘F**k Biden’ and ‘No presidents.’ Oregon Governor Kate Brown rescinded an executive order Sunday that called on State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office in Portland to take charge of the police response to expected violent protests in the wake of Tuesday’s presidential election. I m ending my law enforcement order for Portland. Thank you to everyone who exercised their free speech rights largely through joyful celebration.

Now, the hard work begins to heal the divisions in our nation,”Brown tweeted. Unfortunately, there appears to be a long way to go before the healing can begin, as Oregon State Police arrested four people during competing protests at the State Capitol in Salem on Saturday. Before Brown rescinded the executive order, police deployed tear gas, which had previously been banned, to disperse groups of demonstrators in Portland. Federal agents from DHS & ICE made another bullrush several blocks down the street & effected another arrest. One agent deployed Teargas on the 5-10 protesters remaining in the vicinity.

"8 Nov, 2020",‘Looks like the pandemic is over’? Democrats accused of coronavirus duplicity as huge crowds celebrate Biden’s declared victory,"Huge crowds gathered in cities across the United States to celebrate Joe Biden’s projected 2020 election win, apparently shrugging off the health crisis used to justify the Democrats’ advocacy for mail-in voting. A street party erupted in front of the White House after Joe Biden declared himself the victor in the electoral contest with Donald Trump on Saturday, with similar mass acts of jubilation popping up in cities around the country. Footage shows a sea of people, crammed like sardines, singing in front of the president’s Washington, DC residence. In New York City, merrymakers danced and chanted in Washington Square Park. On the other side of the country, there was“fireworks, champagne and dancing in the streets of LA,”the Los Angeles Timesreported, as people toasted the projected president-elect. The crowd outside the White House celebrating Joe Biden’s projected victory is blaring YMCA — the song President Trump closed out his latest rallies with.pic.twitter.com/UkrsBq8l5M Washington Square Park not waiting for the AP callpic.twitter.com/hB9nbhvhi6 But the celebrations seemed to clash with the Democrats’ months-long narrative that controversial mail-in ballot initiatives were needed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Even CNN’s Jake Tapper felt obliged to point out that the street parties seemed ill-advised considering that“we just had the highest day of infections in the United States.”He took solace in the fact that some people were wearing masks, even though“for some of them they’re slipping off their face.” On Friday, the US registered at least 125,596 new coronavirus cases, the largest single-day number of new infections in the country since the pandemic began. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes suggested that celebrating Biden’s victory trumped social distancing guidelines.“Lots of people need this right now. Keep those masks on and do it outside!”he wrote. Lots of people need this right now. Keep those masks on and do it outside!https://t.co/TckcA2lgOx The change in tune from liberal pundits and voters, who just days ago were arguing that it was not safe to vote in person, predictablytriggeredoutrage on Twitter. “No one should ever take any of the Covid commentary from these guys seriously.

"7 Nov, 2020", You re fired : Gleeful LeBron James among those to gloat as Biden declares victory over Trump,"NBA icon LeBron James couldn t restrain his delight after it was reported on Saturday that Democratic nominee Joe Biden had surpassed the 270 electoral college votes required to send Donald Trump packing from the White House. As soon as Biden s win in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania was reported by the AP and other outlets, handing the former Vice President the state s 20 electoral votes he needed to bring an end to the Trump presidency, social media predictably erupted after a contentious campaign which had stoked divisions across the country. The impact of the campaign was deeply felt in sports. The blacklivesmatter protests earlier this year intersected both politics and sport, as several big name athletes threw their support behind the movement and, by proxy, Biden. The racial debate which followed the death of George Floyd in May was felt particularly hard in the NBA - a sports league where more than 80 percent of its players are African-American. Several players orchestrated their own campaigns to help motivate voters, with several NBA teams even offering their facilities as venues to host voting drives, and even acting as polling centers. And now, with the outcome of the US presidential election seemingly all wrapped up, Los Angeles Lakers star James was quick in celebrating Biden s win. 😉@morethanavote👑pic.twitter.com/n6kmG12H1X 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾https://t.co/2FwRpCKsnB James first tweet, an image of him smoking a cigar, could clearly be interpreted as him celebrating Biden s win - while a second retweet of a video clip of Trump saying You re Fired also left little doubt as to his political persuasion. The NBA star was joined by several other notable names from the sporting community in reacting to the results - but one notable UFC star, vocal Trump supporter Jorge Masvidal, says that he is waiting for the reigning president to step in and correct the record. Joe Biden is projected as the next US President. However VAR are reviewing it. Joe told Trump well Bi-Den 😭😭 The media state has declared Joe Biden the President.

"5 Nov, 2020",‘It was a failure. It was not a success’: Dems melt down on conference call over losing House seats they should have won - reports,"Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Virginia), who is leading her congressional race by a thread, has reportedly blamed the Democrat Party for losing elections “we shouldn’t have lost” due to embracing radical ideas like Defund the Police. During a conference call between Democrats discussing the results of various 2020 elections, Spanberger claimed she nearly lost her race (she’s won by a few thousand votes) because of an attack ad connecting her to the Defund the Police movement. “Don’t say socialism ever again,”the congresswoman said on the call, according to Washington Post reporter Erica Werner. ""We need to be pretty clear … it was a failure. It was not a success,”sheaddedabout election night. While the results of the presidential race remain unclear, Democrats had a disappointing election night regardless, as they failed to gain control of the Senate and actually ended up losing seats in the House, where they still remain the majority party. Werner reported that Spanberger did not find a lot of support on the call, with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) openly disagreeing with the assessment, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) pushing back and saying former President Barack Obama was called a Muslim and socialist without being connected to movements like blacklivesmatter or Defund the Police. Tlaib: They called Obama worse, they called him a Muslim, a socialist, you can blame these words but if it wasn’t on blacklivesmatter would’ve been something else Pelosi reportedlyclaimedduring the conference call that“we did not win every battle, but we won the war.” Like this story?

"5 Nov, 2020",Biden’s beloved celebrity supporters have already proven his call for unity is a sham as their HATE toward Trump voters rages on,"Joe Biden has called for “unity” in a divided America awaiting election results, but celebrity supporters like Michael Moore continue the extreme rhetoric against those they disagree with, showing “unity” is just a sham for them. is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman On Wednesday, as left and right spat back and forth and argued about voter fraud, Biden addressed the nation and called for people to“unite, to heal, to come together.” Many of the former vice president’s most vocal supporters must have not heard that message as they were too busy screaming into their phones, incensed by the very notion that millions of Americans could disagree with them. “Florida is dead to me!”actor John Leguizamo tweeted as Trump began to take a lead in the state – he eventually won it.“Let the lemmings drive their golf carts into the ocean!” Florida is dead to me! Let the lemmings drive their golf carts into the ocean! Leguizamo may be a comedian, but it’s difficult to sense any intended comedy in that tweet. It’s just pure hatred for anything and everything that stands in Biden’s way. A tweet from the liberal talk series The Daily Show took things a step further, albeit in a more joking manner, by putting out a graphic of Florida simply being blown up. Do we have this technology yet?pic.twitter.com/jjqKemqFtO Could a massively successful comedy show hosted by a conservative get away with such a graphic about, say, California without inspiring mainstream media blowback? Just asking. The always level-headed comedian Kathy Griffin went straight for hate as well on election night,repostingan image of her holding the fake severed head of Trump. When originally publicly revealed, this 2017 photoshoot earned plenty of controversy, lost gigs for Griffin, and even a tearful apology from her. Griffin’s attempt at hate originally failed, but she just felt like right now was the perfect time to bring it back. That apology, like Biden’s call to“unite,”was just empty words. At a blacklivesmatter rally, activist and director Ava Duvernay described the election as a“war,”not typically the kind of language you use about people you plan to accept and“unite”with. On and on the hate has gone with other vocal, campaigning liberals like Michael Moore and John Cusack attacking Trump as a“bigot”and“Nazi rapist,”a great start to potential unity. If you’re my Friend and you Voted for Trump... We can still be friends.. I just don’t Trust you. Dear Cubans in Miami,The guy you voted for is the one acting just like Fidel Castro. To everyone: Stop trying addressing Trump supporters like they’re human beings with basic understanding and comprehension. They’re fucking monsters. The very thought of removing Trump from office has only pushed Biden’s most ardent supporters to double down on their hate for a large portion of the country. Biden built a campaign around celebrity-filled events and endorsements, yet these are some of his most hateful backers. How can there be an interest in“unity”when you so clearly despise the very people you are being called to unite with? This hate is unfortunately nothing new. We’ve seen it for four years as even public figures who choose totalk tothe Trump administration about important issues are ridiculed and mocked by the left. When Biden calls for“unity,”they are the words of a man simply putting on a show and distinguishing himself from an opponent he oncecomparedto Fidel Castro and infamous Nazi Joseph Goebbels. Biden has spewed the very hatred his most public supporters seem inclined to keep alive for the foreseeable future.

"5 Nov, 2020",Fraud! Conspiracy! Russia! Our echo chambers have made us terrible losers,"The reaction to the US presidential election and others shows how bad we’ve become at accepting defeat. There are always ‘dark forces’ to blame, when in fact it’s our fault for locking ourselves in echo chambers. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. “You can’t win them all” is a dead phrase. It has passed, is no more, has ceased to be. It’s a stiff. Bereft of life. It is an ex-phrase. My apologies to Messrs Cleese and Palin for the paraphrasing (parrotphrasing?), but the reaction to the US presidential election is yet another exhibit in the case against our ability to accept defeat gracefully. Real-life and, more crucially, online echo chambers have us convinced that when things don’t go our way, it’s down to some kind of villainous deception. Right now, Donald Trump and his followers are crying “fraud!” over the results. There isno evidence of fraudin this election, but Trump had long since laid the ground for people to believe that there would be and therefore justify their denial of reality. He told them that postal votes would be rigged – a claim without a single fact to back it up – because he knew Democrats were more likely to vote by post, especially with the pandemic. But people wanted to hear the rigging line because that way, no matter what happened, they wouldn’t be losers. And when the postal votes came in late, favouring Joe Biden as Trump knew they would, the narrative was set. Now they believe anything theyread on Facebook or Twitterthat fits into what theywantto be true and ignore inconvenient facts. This denial isn’t limited to Trump fans or indeed people of any particular persuasion. Oh no, this condition is pan-political. I guarantee that, shoe on the other foot, Biden’s supporters would have been pointing tovoter suppressionand intimidation, the mysteriousdisappearance of postal votesand even thedisappearance of post boxesafter Trump donor Louis DeJoy was bizarrely appointed as postmaster general. Oh, and to Russia, of course. They might yet need to scream “bias!” at the US Supreme Court. When Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, remember, it was the Russians what did it. Brexit was down to Moscow, too, plus someillegal campaigning. The Scottish independence referendum wasvote-rigging. These weren’t knee-jerk reactions, either. They lingered, the immovable putrid whiff of perceived treachery, crime and untoward shenanigans. A lot of people, and I mean millions, still breathe it in. Not all conspiracy theories involve pizzas or lizards. Sometimes they go mainstream, like when a jazz track somehow makes it into the top 10 of the pop charts (yeah, I’m old). All of these things have one thing in common – they’re baseless. Sure, you’ll find dodgy elements and illegal behaviour at play. You can in any vote. But enough to sway the outcome?Absolutely not. Actually, they have two things in common – they’re baseless and desperate. Trumpists have chanted “stop the count” in one state and “count every vote” in another. You’ve probably seen the very peculiarrantings of his spiritual advisor Paula Whitein which she claims that “angels” are arriving in the US from around the globe to make sure that her boss gets elected. These, like the above, are despairing symptoms of people not being able to face defeat. I’m not judging. Well, I am a bit. But I too have experienced the denial. I was livid after the Brexit referendum. Not that I’m a big fan of the current European Union – I just have very, very little faith in the British government to do anything other than cock the whole thing up. This anger and frustration stuck with me. I couldn’t believe it had happened. How could so many people vote that way? I felt similarly at the last UK general election, when we handed authoritarian levels of power to a troupe of malevolent clowns. Eventually, I got over these things and accepted the situation. Not liked, but accepted. But the reason I couldn’t answer that question for quite some time is that I didn’t know or talk to many people who didn’t agree with me. Like so many of us, I lived in anecho chamber. I’ve started to break out but, if it wasn’t for my job, maybe I’d be bolstering its walls. More than ever we’re surrounding ourselves with agreeable voices, because it’s easier than ever. We believe what we believe and now have access to thousands of people who will tell us we’re right. Not just agree with us partially or generally, but absolutely. And therefore our views become absolutist. Grey areas are separated into black and white. This article, like so many I’ve written, will have comments under it on social media from people who have read nothing but the headline and built an opinion on that. Bless you for reading this far. We don’t go online to learn from the vast trove of knowledge at our fingertips, we go online to find evidence - real orfake- that supports our preconceptions. We don’t go online to debate, we go online to win. Our opponents are wrong. If we don’t get our own way or simply don’t like the way the world is, well, there must be something fishy going on – and some corner of the internet will agree with us. Don’t get me wrong. To question the status quo or collective narratives is fine. To have the courage of your convictions is also fine. Lose and accept, but go again if you want. But without admission of difference and defeat, the ability to stare down the barrel of a fact rifle and respect the ammunition, the ability to change our minds, we crumble as a society. That way chaos lies. One of the editors at RT showed me a letter written by George HW Bush (aka Bush Sr.) to Bill Clinton after Clinton defeated him in the 1992 presidential election. Contrast it to Trump’s reaction this week and tell me which you think is the healthier, smarter, nobler, and classier. As we consider the prospect of graceless Presidential transition, remember this letter from George HW Bush.pic.twitter.com/FUJHIGPRhx I’d like to offer a solution. I’d like to say that we should all take the time to mix more often with people of opposing views and to understand those views. I’d like to say that we should keep social media for animal videos, holiday snaps and memes and use the information age in a way that broadens our minds. I’d like to say, grow up and learn to be good losers, like George HW Bush. I’d like to suggest we resurrect the ‘you can’t win them all’ attitude. I’d like to do all that but, frankly, no one who disagrees with me will have read this far. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"5 Nov, 2020",Trump’s reign has proved the US president is merely a figurehead. Does it really matter who wins the vote?,"Four years of Trump slugging it out with the permanent political class he calls the “Deep State” has proven that president is at best a ceremonial post. Why are we still biting our nails over who won, when it changes so little? is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Love him or hate him, President Donald Trump has done more than any other politician this century to pull up the curtain on the entrenched political interests that really run Washington, drawing them out of the shadows to defend what they believe is their turf against the spray-tanned barbarian at the gates. Between his uncouth mannerisms and his alarmingly sane policy promises, Trump in 2016 broke all the unwritten rules of being president, leaving his Deep State nemeses to pick up the pieces and try to put them back together. Four years later, Trump has been largely neutered, his media crucifixion and lamentably orthodox term a cautionary tale to all future presidents who might try to buck the system. The powers that be no longer need to assassinate a troublesome president – it’s far easier (and less messy) to kill their spirit. Trump has not ended any wars (indeed, he’s dropped morebombson more civilians than superhawks George W. Bush and Barack Obama), nor has he drained the Washington ‘swamp’ of lobbyists, career politicians and think tank goons (unless you count appointing them to his cabinet as ‘draining’). Instead, he’s cut taxes for the rich, rolled back the regulations that kept Big Business from polluting America’s air and water, and given away the store toIsrael, even assassinating one of its most powerful enemies, the Iranian Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani. While some of his supporters no doubt love those latter policies, these are the kind of ‘wins’ any other president would secure to please his wealthy masters – hardly the actions of a maverick like Trump fans believe their hero to be. The square peg has been stuffed into the round hole. Trump has become a creature of the establishment that (ironically) still hates him, even as heblustersabout locking some of them up. Indeed, what’s probably the most ironic aspect of the nail-biting coverage of the still-undecided 2020 election is how similar a Joe Biden administration would be to Trump’s. The US would remain at war in Syria and Afghanistan, continue trying to provoke war in Iran and needling Russia (probablyChina too, since Biden would be wary of seeming ‘soft’ on the foreign entity he’s said to be controlled by), maintain its practice of bending over backwards to service Israel, and keep screwing its own working class out of a decent standard of living. Progressive Democrats who held their nose and voted for Biden out of the misguided belief they would be able to drag him to the left once in office will feel awfully stupid when, as president, he governs as he did as Obama’s sidekick. The tear-jerking specter of ‘kids in cages’ arose from Obama’s immigration policies, after all – he wasn’t called the“deporter in chief”for nothing – and Biden was a fervent cheerleader for the five wars and thousands of drone strikes his boss launched. It was Obama whose 2012decreemade it legal to detain a US citizen indefinitely, anywhere, without habeas corpus under the aegis of fighting terrorism, and Biden whose 1994 crime bill has packed American prisons with black and brown men guilty of non-violent (and in some cases, shockingly minor) crimes. Yet the establishment media narrative has cast the Biden campaign as crusaders for social justice and equality – so opposite the ‘racist’ and ‘misogynist’ Trump campaign that it comes with a woman of color as vice president in Kamala Harris. Trump hasn’t helped, claiming that the former California attorney general, who loved mass incarceration so much she wanted to lock up the mothers of truantkids, is aradical leftist.A Biden campaign would be a Trojan horse for socialism, the right has wailed, even though Biden is so chummy with Wall Street he far outstripped the president indonationsfrom the financial sector. How many Wall Street donors did democratic socialist Bernie Sanders attract when he was running? Exactly. Four years of Trump has made abundantly clear that while presidents are allowed to talk tough and promise the moon, the minute they try to actually put those crazy policies into action – by bringing troops home, making nice with geopolitical rivals, or choking off the cross-border flow of cheap illegal immigrant labor – the not-so-invisible hand of the Deep State intervenes. There’s always a‘chemical weapons attack’that can be staged to keep a lucrative war going, and opposition research firms have plenty of disgruntled Russian PR execs on speed dial willing to spin upfantastic storiesabout lascivious hotel romps. Those kids in cages will be thrown in people’s faces until the president gets his mind right about borders, too – it doesn’t matter who built the cages. The president’s role is merely to serve as the pretty face explaining away the ugly reality of empire – which explains why Trump has rankled the establishment so deeply. When your ‘pretty face’ is a walking caricature of the Ugly American, other countries’ ruling classes don’t take you seriously. It also explains why Trump initially appealed to so many Americans – it was voters’ chance to drop a giant turd in the geopolitical punchbowl, sticking it to their ruling class oppressors in a way they seldom get the opportunity to do. A Biden presidency will appear calmer on the surface, as the former VP is not interested in upending the established order – something he made abundantly clear decades ago. The media might even start reporting that the country has turned the corner in the Covid-19 pandemic, that the economy’s disastrous self-inflicted gunshot wound to the foot is healing, that it’s ‘morning in America’ again. But millions of Americans will still be out of work, hopelessly in debt, threatened with eviction, and forced to watch impotently as their infrastructure crumbles and their tax dollars are shoveled into the Pentagon’s furnace to pay for more war. Attempts to complain online will be mercilessly censored – just as they are now, despite the president’s bloviating about repealing social media platforms’ Section 230 liability protections. But individual Americans will be told they’re the only ones who don’t like the shiny new coat of paint hiding the rot. Neither ‘side’ will concede without a fight, and whoever is ultimately named the victor, the other’s supporters will almost certainly take to the streets and make a mess. Under Biden, these riots will be denounced as extremist violence; under Trump, they will be hailed as peaceful manifestations of democracy. As with Obama’s election in 2008, any ‘resistance’ to Trump’s excesses will evaporate immediately if Biden wins, even as he commits the same excesses in service to the same ruling class. And if Trump wins? Get ready for more of the same, America. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"4 Nov, 2020",Election night tensions see blacklivesmatter protests erupt across US (VIDEOS),"Troublemakers have been arrested across the US, from Washington DC to Seattle, as anti-racism demonstrators pushed the limits of largely peaceful protest on election night. Thousands of people took to the streets of cities including Washington DC, Seattle, Portland, and New York after America voted on Tuesday. The demonstrations centered on the racial equality movement, but they have varied in scope and focus. More than 1,000 people gathered in front of the White House, protesting against Donald Trump’s presidency and campaigning for racial equality, while smaller protests took place elsewhere in the country. In Washington, people convened on blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) Plaza, one block away from the White House. Some held“Trump / Pence Out”signs and denounced the president for being a ‘racist’. Others marched through the city’s downtown area, setting off fireworks, blocking traffic, and confronting bystanders and police.

"4 Nov, 2020",The world now sees that there’s no exceptionalism or grandeur in American democracy but only chaos & a sense of injustice,"Even if Trump loses, the truth is that to many Americans Trumpism isn’t a pathology but a new normal which is a product of a massive social divide caused by dissatisfaction with the political system and life in general. Tom Fowdyis a British writer and analyst of politics and international relations with a primary focus on East Asia. The world watches with bated breath as the US Presidential election sits at a dead heat. It’s going down to the wire and nobody knows who is going to emerge victor yet. Despite polls having shown a comfortable Joe Biden victory, Donald Trump has again come out far stronger than expected and thus both parties are now chasing down every vote in crucial swing states to surpass the electoral college tally of 270. The President however, has already declared victory forhimself, and has threatened courtactionshould things go against him with longstanding objections to mail-in absentee ballots. His defiance means that should he technically lose, a contested result is inevitable. Audiences around the world are either way aghast. What they see does not fill them with confidence. In other western countries, the thought of enduring four more years of Trump or for that matter, that he’s still performing far better than expected despite everything, makes little sense. Even if Biden wins, such a tight and deadlocked outcome ultimately makes him unconvincing, revealing a sharply divided country which at large cannot find faith in an alternative to a Trumpism, which beyond its borders is widely derided as woeful. The resilience of Trump’s platform either way is endemic of an American system that is simply not delivering. The last four years are not perceived as a“bad mistake”which will“go away”but a deeper and more pervasive identity conflict which will persist. Public opinion in the United States and among its allies in Europe could not be further apart. When polled on their preferences for thiselection, the outcome was a no brainer for EU citizens who favoured Biden by margins as high as 80%. In their minds, Trump was so awful and so damaging to America’s standing in the world that for him to go forward again could not be contemplated. They have a lot of reasons to cite, too many to list in this article. Many in the world were not quite prepared for the fact that Trump’s support would in fact hold up, and like in 2016 confound opinion pollsters. How could such a“safe hands alternative”as Biden have to fight a walking disaster to the knife edge? Either way it goes, the affair paints a grim picture for American democracy. A loose cannon like Trump not only remains competitive, but it also shows there are underlying problems in American society which are yet to be addressed. Even if he marginally loses, there is a hard hitting truth that for all of its seemingly awful tendencies, to many average Americans Trumpism isn’t a pathology, it isn’t a mistake and it isn’t a bad smell that can be simply vanquished, it’s a new normal and a product of massive social divides in the United States which spells widespread dissatisfaction with the political system and prospects for life in general. Trump’s pleas to bring back jobs toAmerica, to restore national glory and emphasize identity have widespread appeal even if we can point out their damaging consequences. These factors have allowed Trump not to sink as liberal critics envisioned and were again complacent about, but to float. Sagas such as the blacklivesmatter protests which played out over the summer were hugely controversial, and irrespective of how you judge the situation,served in fact to further consolidate the polarization of rivalcampsand entrench identities. The enormous acceleration in turnout illustrates that to many the stakes of this election were huge. In essence, it is a clash between two very different and antagonistic visions ofAmerica. Those who hate Trump may have turned out, but as have those who see the President as defending a way of life which they feel is slipping away. Biden of course may still win, yet can we say he would come out smelling of roses? And for that matter would Trump? Absolutely not, these very divides as set out and the closeness of the result guarantee imminent controversy and anger, either way. Such polarization means“the other half”is likely to express dismay and in the case of Trump losing, he’s going to incite chaos in contesting the result and will ultimately exacerbate the very identity conflict which has made him so influential to begin with. Again to the wider world, this holds negative connotations for America’s credibility and political system, it does not radiate exceptionalism or grandeur in its democracy as many politicians like to claim, but chaos, uncertainty and a prevailing sense of injustice. If anything, even madness. As we eagerly await the outcome, those who assumed Trump was doomed to certain failure were wrong, yet again. He could yet go down, but not without a wholly damaging fight with massive implications for the legitimacy of his successor, and vice versa. If anything, this has shown us that problems in American politics and society continue to abound in ways outside observers just don’t understand and have produced a bitterly divided country whereby multiple visions of its identity are competing, and neither is prepared to give up the fight so easily.

"4 Nov, 2020","George Galloway: Has Trump won? Well, as Bill Clinton might say, it depends what you mean by ‘won’...","Donald Trump has ‘won’ the US presidential election because he has not lost it. A classic insurgent trope, he can rightly claim to have been a guerilla president even while often acting like a truculent gorilla. was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years. He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator. Follow him on Twitter@georgegalloway was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years. He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator. Follow him on Twitter@georgegalloway The might of the American deep state and the unprecedented levels of excoriation, detestation and hate from the liberal classes have failed to break Donald Trump. The four-year Russiagate scam, the phony impeachment and the Mueller Report all tried and failed, too. His vote has gone UP from 2016. The supposed ‘racist’ appears to have scored more support among ‘communities of colour’ than he did last time. The man who is said to use the N-word and to have thought Black Lives Didn’t Matter Much gained more votes from black men. The vulgar sexist got more votes from women. The man who ‘caged’ Latino children at the borderlands saw his vote rise amongst Latinos and Latinas. In fact, Trump’s vote is up amongst every demographic of gender and ethnicity except white men – the very people he is imagined to have exclusively appealed to with every Coke-fuelled burp and hamburger-fuelled pump. Virtually every commentator in America is left with egg on their face. There was no ‘blue wave’. The president’s party – for that is what it is – won seats in the House and the Democrats’ flipping of the Senate is as flat as a pancake. President Donald Trump has ‘coat-tails’. Who d have thunk it? Even the most noxious of the president’s men – Lindsey Graham and Moscow Mitch McConnell – triumphed, pulled over the line by the circus act that is Trump. The Democratic gamble of fielding, for the second time running, the only candidate who could lose to Donald Trump has clearly failed, whatever happens next. Centrism is not the winning hand against right-wing populism, something parties in Europe had better learn fast. In this case, the donkeys in America already knew that, but decided to test Einstein’s law to destruction. Trying the same thing over again and expecting a different result is indeed a definition of madness. All of the above is true, whatever the final result of the imbroglio. Trump’s brazen press conference in which he simultaneously claimed victory and fraud was exactly what a right-wing populist would do. And perfectly timed – he was well ahead in the Midwest rust-belt when inexplicable abandonment of counting for the night was the optimal moment to cry-foul. Trump might be a moron, but he certainly ain’t stupid. He tripled his majority in Florida, and comfortably won Texas and Ohio, where the shattered punditocracy had claimed the opposite would happen. It seems obvious that the liberal-centrists of America don’t know their country at all. The east and west coast political salons – a giant, self-referential bubble – are bust. The man who has presided over the coronavirus catastrophe, governs a maelstrom of mass unemployment, mass poverty and extreme levels of hunger and homelessness, has somehow won. Even if it depends what you mean by won. Onwards to the Supreme Court, stuffed to the gills with conservative justices, like a giant Christmas turkey. It’s enough to make a horse laugh.

"4 Nov, 2020",4 ‘Trump supporters’ stabbed after election night fight near White House – DC police,"Three men and a woman, who identified themselves as supporters of Donald Trump, have been taken to hospital with non life-threatening knife injuries, which they received in a fight near the White House, DC police said. It was not immediately clear if the fight had any connection with a protest rally staged in front of the presidential residence on election night. The scuffle happened near the intersection of 14th Street and New York Avenue Northwest around 2:30am EST, police reported. Law enforcement are now looking for three suspects over the incident. Stabbing: 1400 b/o New York Avenue, NW. LOF: Lookout is for Suspects (1 & 2) B/Ms wearing all black clothing and Suspect (3) B/F wearing black sweatpants w/ white stripe, orange leggings and a dark gray coat armed with a knife The victims said they were members of the Proud Boys, a right-wing pro-Trump group. The police said the suspects may be part of the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) movement, according to CBS affiliate WUSA9. A Twitter account for blacklivesmatter angrily rejected this, saying it was a lie and that outlets reporting it were“doing irresponsible dangerous journalism.” .@wusa9this is a LIE! You all are doing irresponsible dangerous journalism.@Mvmnt4BlkLivesor@DMVBlackLiveshave nothing to do with these stabbings. Shame on@ChiefNewsham@DCPoliceDeptsharing false information. This story need to be retracted.https://t.co/HgghAZXDhL Right-wing website the Gateway Pundit reported that one of the victims was Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys. He told the outlet that his stomach was slashed during the altercation. Conservative activist Bevelyn Beatty was also stabbed during the altercation, according to the site. A video purportedly showing the fight and its immediate aftermath, including the arrival of a police patrol, is circulating on social media. The party that shot the video can be heard in it claiming they had been“jumped by blacklivesmatter ”and discussing the injuries their members sustained. The US is tensely awaiting the final tally of votes in the Tuesday presidential election, which failed to produce a clear-cut victory for either incumbent Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden. As the pressure mounts, many Americans are participating in rallies in large cities, including Washington, DC. There were some minor scuffles with the police overnight in DC, but otherwise the situation remained peaceful. Ahead of election day, many shop owners had boarded up their businesses, fearing possible rioting and looting. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"4 Nov, 2020",This election is a TRIUMPH of class over identity. That’s the most surprising and important result,"Regardless of whether Trump or Biden win the 2020 US presidential election, what it has revealed is that the pollsters and expert commentators simply do not get class; for them – the working class is a relic of the past. is an author and social commentator. He is an emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent in Canterbury. Author ofHow Fear Works: The Culture of Fear in the 21st Century.Follow him on Twitter@Furedibyte is an author and social commentator.

Alternatively, you are either a man or woman or straight or gay or trans or member of a variety of identity groups. The cultural elites have projected throughout this year the vision that all the different identity groups were going to gang up against Trump and overwhelm his shrinking number of white male supporters. According to the playbook promoted by woke media outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, or Vox, Trump is a hardcore racist who only appeals to the white supremacist electorate. However, contrary to this fantasy, the polls in Florida and Texas showed that Trump did better amongst Hispanics and black people than they imagined. That the Republicans actually increased their vote amongst these groups, in these two key states, indicates that identitarians cannot rely on identity trumping class. No doubt there are many reasons why the polls always underestimate the electorate’s support for Trump and for populist causes like Brexit. But one reason why they get it wrong is that they tend to talk to people who are like themselves – university educated professionals whose view of the world is fundamentally different to the kind of people who deliver their Amazon packages and work behind the counter in supermarkets. The polls also get it wrong because working class people know that their views are regarded with contempt by the media elite and they often opt to keep their views to themselves. As it turned out, one of the crucial differences between people who voted for Biden or Trump is whether during this pandemic you managed to work from home or whether you had to go outside to make a living. While the professional class were sipping their cups of tea at home and posting angry tweets denouncing Trump, working people were busy doing jobs outside their houses. The college educated professional was far more likely to vote for Biden than the guys maintaining the nation’s infrastructure in the freezing cold who supported Trump. Pollsters either pretend or believe that the working class is a relic of the past. The culture elites more or less echo this view and insofar as they acknowledge the existence of working-class people, they regard them as just another identity group. They still refer to ‘working class masculinity’ or ‘toxic masculinity’ when they summon up the image of a working-class person. Since they imagine that the phenomenon of the working class is personified by a racist white man, they were surprised to discover that poor Latinos like struggling white folk are far more likely to vote for Trump than for Biden. That class really matters is illustrated by the kind of people who funded the Biden and Trump campaigns. The big banks, tech giants, and university-educated, highly-paid professionals showered Biden with their cash. In contrast, it was working people – maintenance workers and truck drivers – with their 10-dollar cheques who helped fund the Trumpcampaign. Unexpectedly, a populist coalition of working people has been forged around the Trump phenomenon. Historically, the democraticparty could rely on the support of the working class. Like the Labour Party in the UK, the democraticparty has lost interest in its working-class base and has decided to become a movement voicing the outlook of relatively well-paid, educated professionals. What the election has shown is that the American cultural elite does not always have its way. Identity politics has suffered a major setback thanks to the instinct of common sense of working-class people. Hopefully working-class people will draw inspiration from their success at exposing the fantasies peddled by the polls and will gain confidence in the belief that their voice really matters.

"4 Nov, 2020",Trump’s minority support sends identity-obsessed woke poseurs over the edge,"As election night raged on, President Trump once again defied expectations in Florida and won the state – fueled, apparently, by unprecedented support from Hispanic and black voters.

His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Liberals love to denounce Trump as a devout racist, but his victory in the Sunshine State (and maybe re-election) thanks to Latino and black voters, is a gloriously resounding rebuke to racial and ethnic identity politics. The woke reaction to this stunning admonishment has been to let their diversity loving masks fall and reveal their true racist nature by questioning the bona fides of certain Latinos and chastising them for thinking on their own. For instance, Nikole Hannah-Jones, the New York Times editor who created the controversial Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project, tweeted after Trump won Florida that she was going to“write a piece about how Latino is a contrived ethnic category that lumps white Cubans with Black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans and helps explains why Latinos support Trump at the second highest rate.” One day after this election is over I am going to write a piece about how Latino is a contrived ethnic category that artificially lumps white Cubans with Black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans and helps explains why Latinos support Trump at the second highest rate. This was followed by a tweet from commentator Jemele Hill that stated,“If Trump wins re-election, it’s on white people. No one else.” If Trump wins re-election, it’s on white people. No one else. According to Hannah-Jones and Hill, we don’t need to follow Dr. Martin Luther King’s desire to judge people by the content of their character, instead we must only judge people by the color of their skin and their mindless dedication to the woke cause. What Jones and Hill are really doing here is putting a twist on Joe Biden’s memorably paternalistic claim to black voters during the campaign that if they consider voting for Trump,“they ain’t black!” For Jones and Hill, if Latinos vote for Trump, they must be those evil“white Latinos,”while the ‘real’ Latinos, like the black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans, think the same way she does. Of course, she has no idea what the breakdown of the Latino vote is, but she is incapable of seeing things through any other filter than black versus white. One can’t help but wonder what vitriol Jones and Hill privately spew towards the black voters who voted for Trump in Florida and substantially boosted his chances of victory. I assume they think they really“ain’t black,”and if they are black then they must be self-loathing Uncle Toms or some other repulsive slur. What Trump’s solid showing with Hispanics and blacks in Florida really shows is that the vapid woke pandering on race and ethnicity resonates more with comfortable suburban white voters who want to signal their phony virtue than it does with actual minorities. It is like the demand from blacklivesmatter in the wake of the George Floyd death for cities to ‘Defund the Police’. That plays well in suburbs where crime isn’t an issue, but in poor, crime infested, inner-city neighborhoods, that message is not going to go over so well. Another example is Latino voters, many of whom are either immigrants or direct descendants of immigrants. They didn’t come to America thinking it was the racist hellhole that Hannah-Jones and her 1619 Project make it out to be. They see America as a glorious opportunity to better themselves and their children. These Latinos don’t watch the blacklivesmatter riots over the summer and sympathize with the looters, they empathize with the store owners who were having their life’s work destroyed. The same disconnect is true regarding the incessant claim to victimhood by the proponents of wokeness. Social Justice Warriors demand that minorities embrace victimhood, but you know what? Most people don’t want to be victims, don’t want to be told what to think and don’t want to be seen as avatars for some soulless identity group, but rather as individuals. This is not a black, white, Latino or Asian thing… this is a human thing. Human beings, no matter their race, ethnicity or any other identifying trait, are all unique and want to be seen and treated accordingly. One would hope that this slap in the face to Social Justice Warriors and the woke brigade would snap them out of the spell of identity politics. But I doubt that happens. The woke will never take responsibility for their failure. There will be no introspection, no self-evaluation and re-configuration. There will only be more blame. In fact, I am sure these Latinos who voted for Trump will no doubt become the villains of 2020, replacing Russians from the 2016 election. In conclusion, Trump’s minority support in Florida speaks volumes about the amazing power of the melting pot of America, and the vicious, venal and vacuous nature of those who live and die by the woke sword of identity politics.

"3 Nov, 2020","As America’s FIRST RESULTS roll in, Trump & Biden victories in New Hampshire set off online affray","A Trump victory in one New Hampshire village and a Biden win in another: the first 26 votes counted in the presidential election have set off an online argument that’s surely a taste of what’s to come across the country. The New Hampshire hamlets of Dixville Notch and Millsfield both open their polling locations at midnight, and announce their results before anywhere else in the US. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Dixville Notch announced a landslide win for Joe Biden, with the Democrat taking all five of the community’s votes. Fifteen miles away in Millsfield, Donald Trump scored a convincing victory, taking 16 votes to Biden’s five. Millsfield goes to Trumppic.twitter.com/D3ZmpQqmhZ Results are in: 5 votes for Biden/Harris, 0 votes for Trump/Pence.#Election2020#ElectionDay#MidnightVote#DixvilleNotch#PresidentialElection#NHpoliticspic.twitter.com/R24iDOu4pe Nothing about these results was surprising. Dixville Notch voted 4-2 for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while Millsfield voted for Trump by 16 votes to four that year. Millsfield is located inside a deep red district, but New Hampshire as a whole is trending toward Biden, if the polls are to be believed. The most recentsurveysput the former vice president between eight and 10 points ahead in a state that Hillary Clinton managed to scrape a 0.3 point win out of in 2016. America’s first 26 election-day votes set off a storm of argument online. Democrats and liberals touted Biden’s flawless victory in Dixville Notch as a sign of things to come, and the media wrote up headlines on his five-point win. Biden is the first presidential candidate to sweep Dixville Notch since Richard Nixon in 1960. Times have changed. In 1980, Dixville Notch went for Reagan 17-3; in 2004, Bush won 19-7.https://t.co/Wx7XteB0sI Republicans and Trump supporters countered with their own success story, and attacked the American media for focusing on Dixville Notch. What about Millsfield NH? Do you report that too , it is 16 - 5 to Trumppic.twitter.com/ph9pYbEOrb BREAKING: DONALD TRUMP WON! (in Millsfield, NH)https://t.co/Gn8jkI3Yfb And Millsfield, N.H. kicks Dixville Notch right in the family jewels. Take that!https://t.co/ZqTzqAWkaW Outraged liberals slammed the “white” electorate of Millsfield for voting Trump, and began crossing the tiny township off their imaginary travel itineraries. No way!! Millsfield, New Hampshire is 100% white?! I never would have guessed by the way they voted.#2020Electionspic.twitter.com/vIiyUpoJw8 Remind me to never visit Millsfield, New Hampshire. Twenty-six votes is a drop in the ocean compared to the nearly 100 million early votes cast so far nationwide. However, the online squabbling over the first New Hampshire tallies is likely a neat microcosm of what will follow across the country on Tuesday. By calling races, the media wields enormous influence over the final result. Fox News’ decision tocallFlorida for George W. Bush in 2000, for example, is widely considered to be the final nail in the coffin of Al Gore’s presidential bid, even though Bush was behind at the time. As the day wears on, Trump’s supporters – already distrustful of the media – will likely continue to ream liberal-leaning news outlets for covering the Dixville Notches of the country and not the Millsfields. And, as the results come in, both sides will surely abuse and attack each other online. The climate of hostility surrounding this year’s election has led business owners in America’s largest cities to board up their storefronts in anticipation of post-election violence. A number of groups, among them blacklivesmatter and various ‘Antifa’ organizations, havepromisedto take to the streets if Donald Trump is re-elected. Think your friends would be interested?

"2 Nov, 2020",Kirsty Alley’s treatment is yet another reminder that ‘liberals’ can’t cope when women and black voters don’t agree with them,"The ‘Cheers’ actress is the latest public figure to show us the intolerance of the left when it comes to women and black Americans dissenting from and even criticizing them. is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman If the 2020 presidential election cycle has shown us one thing it’s that the US has an issue with tolerance at the moment. While tribalism is prevalent in both major political parties, it is the anti-Trump crowd that has proven themselves to have a particular issue with women and black voters who express opinions that break their narrative of the republicanparty equaling white supremacy. Kirstie Alley is the latest to burst out of the leftist bubble of Hollywood and target liberals. The ‘Cheers’ star has faced near-constant criticism on social media for her support of Donald Trump, and she appeared on Fox News’ ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ on Sunday to slam CNN for fear-mongering when it comes to the Covid-19 pandemic. “They are broadcasting terror because it’s a deflection. When the thing came out with Biden, and is he in cahoots with China? Is he in cahoots with Ukraine? OK, let’s find out, I would say,”she said of the anti-Trump network. The actress accused CNN of“terrifying people 24/7”in an effort to shame them into voting for Biden. One can argue the merits of Alley’s words, but that’s not really the point when reactions from the left amount to little more than pure dismissal. “Kirstie Alley is the new Roseanne,”former-actor-turned-full-time-Trump-critic Tom Arnold tweeted, bringing back memories of his ex-wife, a comedian who signed away the rights to her own hit show in an effort to apologize for a bad joke targeting an Obama official. Her seriescontinuesto run without her, by the way, while she is nothing more than a punching bag/cancel-culture success story for Democrats. Kirstie Alley is the new Roseanne.https://t.co/bwcTNg1CYN That criticism was mild; others mainly focused on Alley’s physical appearance and her affiliation with the Church of Scientology for their ‘takedowns.’ She puts any more vaseline on that lens its gonna slide off she s a hot mess 2 cults They echo others who have been blasting Alley, some of whom have waved her off by simply labeling her a“right-wing nationalist.” There is nothing at all radical left about preserving our democracy I’m shocked you are a right wing nationalist. Wow , you support this cruel fascist racist lying regime ? And a mentally ill leader. someone who elevates hatred and supports nazis ? What are you thinking ? She should get together with James Woods. They d make a nice demented pair. Who woulda thunk it. I would call for all us to cancel Kirstie Alley but that would require us all going to thrift stores to find VHS copies of “Look Who’s Talking” and then burning them.https://t.co/pQNUUZR9sw It’s par for the course at this point, especially when it comes to celebrities. Just look at the cases of black artists who chose to give the cold shoulder to Democrats this year – despite Biden’s loving attempt to win them over by saying“you ain’t black”if you don’t vote for him. Rapper 50 Cent made a not-so-serious endorsement of Trump when he publicly slammed Biden’s proposed tax plan. The move was so offensive that white comedian and ex-girlfriend Chelsea Handler was given aplatformthe next day to“remind him he’s black”and should vote Democrat. And Handler is not the only white liberal who feels the need to ‘correct’ black people who dare to move towards the middle or question the Democrat Party. Rappers ‘Lil Wayne and Ice Cube have both faced scrutiny for even engaging in conversations about Trump’s Platinum Plan, which promises billions to black-owned businesses. ‘Lil Wayne has been called a“sellout”for praising the plan, including by white actor Michael McKean, while Ice Cube has been on the defensive since it was revealed he actually consulted with White House adviser Jared Kushner on the set of promises to the black community. Lil Wayne’s coon chip activated?? Ice Cube is MAGA and is dropping his latest track “Hug The Police” featuring Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens 11/2/2020. Ice Cube talked all that shit in the name of Black power and its revealed he s working with donald trump. Black oppression will always be sold to the highest bidder. This dude acted like he wasn t voting for either candidate when he was working all this time with Trump. Coward. CNN pundits like Don Lemon have warned Cube about “being used” and he’s been defending himself for the mere act of talking with people he disagrees with – he’s not endorsed Trump – about issues he feels are important. Then there’s the rabbit hole that is Kanye West, a former Trump supporter running an independent presidential campaign we’ve been warned by media heads could be a ‘spoiler’ move on Trump’s behalf, while white celebrities like Jennifer Anniston have conveniently informed us it’s“not funny”to consider voting for an independent black man over a 77-year-old white guy who’s been in politics for decades during which time he’s done everything from help usher in the controversial 1994 crime bill and vote for the Iraq War. Asked about prominent rappers publicly breaking from the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chalked it up to selfishness, using 50 Cent’s concerns over taxes to also belittle Ice Cube and ‘Lil Wayne. “It shows how they have their own priorities from a class solidarity perspective,”she said. We asked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about rappers Lil’ Wayne, 50 Cent and Ice Cube showing support for President Trump@PIX11News@AOCpic.twitter.com/dCYYJCKbBJ It is the dismissive nature of the criticisms and the defensive tones forced upon public figures breaking with the left that suggests there is a long road ahead when it comes to Democrats and their willingness to engage with women and black voters whom they see as ignorant because their political opinions break with whatever narratives about race and sex they have concocted in their minds. The color of one’s skin and one’s sex should never create a standard of opinions for them to live up to. True equality is being allowed to think whatever you choose and for people to listen and engage with the ideas rather than turning towards details about a person that have nothing to do with politics. Trump critics may paint themselves as do-gooder social justice warriors fighting for civil rights, but the outright refusal to even listen to those who face the actual discrimination they speak of on a daily basis when they happen to disagree with what’s considered the ‘norm’ shows they are truly only interested in protecting and engaging with those within their political bubble. This myopic thinking is an issue no matter who is president. The left has a problem engaging with ideas at the moment, especially ones that come from people with the skin color or gender they assume should mean they already agree with them.

"1 Nov, 2020",On Contact: Shredding journalistic credibility,"On the show this week, Chris Hedges and Matt Taibbi examine how the media and the major tech platforms function as a propaganda and censorship bureau on behalf of the democraticparty and the Biden campaign. Author and journalist, Matt Taibbi, has been following developments since Twitter and Facebook blocked a New York Post story about a cache of emails reportedly belonging to Democratic nominee Joe Biden s son Hunter, with Twitter locking the New York Post out of its account for over a week. The overt censorship is emblematic of the widening and dangerous partisan divide into information that hurts or promotes one political faction over another, and is now infecting nearly all news organizations. YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook.com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/on-contact MT:I do believe, I mean, I have maybe a naive hope that some canny entrepreneur will realize that there s a screaming need out there for a new kind of media product.  I mean, I hear it every day from people sending emails that I just wish there was a place I could go to find out just what happened, stripped of all the editorializing, right?  Like, people want the old school, boring, you know, when, why, where, how, you know, third person dead voice that we used to get in all of these--in all the newspapers.  And they re not getting that anymore because everything is highly charged and highly politicized and tailored for a political audience. CH:Twitter and Facebook blocked access to a New York Post story about a cache of emails reportedly belonging to Democratic nominee Joe Biden s son, Hunter, with Twitter locking the New York Post out of its own account for over a week.  This overt censorship is emblematic of a widening and dangerous partisan divide within the US media.  News and facts are no longer true or false.  They re divided into information that hurts or promotes one political faction over another.  While outlets such as Fox News have always existed as an arm of the republicanparty , this partisanship has now infected nearly all news organizations, including publications such as the New York Times and the Washington Post along with the major tech platforms that disseminate news.  The division of the press into warring factions shreds journalistic credibility, creating a world where facts do not matter and where a public is encouraged to believe whatever it wants to believe.  Joining me to discuss the rapidly disintegrating media landscape and its consequences is the journalist and author, Matt Taibbi.  So Matt, you ve I think written as well on this as anyone in the country and you--and I want to go all the way back to 2016 because it s not a new concern for you.  But let s begin with 2016, which was awful and--but now it s worse.  Can you talk about the progression? MT:Sure.  I mean I think what happened in 2016, and it s kind of been a story that s assumed biblical importance for people in the news media, we had this episode where a cache of emails that had come from the Democratic National Committee and from figures like Tony Podesta came to be in the public sphere through groups like WikiLeaks.  And this material was true.  It wasn t fake.  It wasn t what we would traditionally call disinformation or misinformation but it was reported on in a small way but later blamed for helping elect Donald Trump.  And as a result, a kind of a coalition of news media, tech platforms, and politicians have since demanded that the next time a situation like this takes place, we have to make sure that nobody reports material like that.  And so we re now in an analogous situation, a semi-analogous situation where there s been an explosive report about some emails allegedly belonging to the nominee s son, Hunter Biden.  And there s been suppression and the news agencies have essentially decided we re not going to do what we did in 2016.  We re going to shut this off the completely. CH:But this wasn t just Biden.  They will run with stuff like the Steele dossier that has no--obviously can t be fact checked.  They will trumpet that because it hurts Trump and I m not talking about partisan news outlets like MSNBC, which is just an arm of the democraticparty , I m talking about these old traditional media outlets like The New York Times, the kind of language that they ll use.  One, they ll marginalize any kind of news even in this case of the--Biden--Hunter Biden s laptop, the Bidens, no one has denied its authenticity.  And yet the way they write about it will be to discredit it as black propaganda.  I mean--so what s happened within--I think there s kind of a sea change within that traditional media which I come out of, just a whole new ethic.  I mean, I find days when I read The New York Times, it s unrecognizable in terms of how it writes, the language it uses, what it s willing to say.  It has many faults which you know as well as I do.  However, it s really a completely new organization in many ways.  Can you--can you talk about that shift?  Because I find that very frightening. MT:Sure.  And of course obviously you would know this better than I would, but I think traditionally what the New York Times would do with a story like this is they would work very hard to ascertain first whether the material was real and it would wait to come out with some kind of pronouncement about its news value until it had done that.  And that is exactly what they don t do anymore.  You know, really in the first days after the story broke, they already had a story by Kevin Roose in the paper that--the headline was something along the lines of, you know, there was a mistake in 2016 and Facebook promised to fix it.  Well, this is what the fixing looks like, you know, and then they--the lead of that… CH:Right.  Let me--Matt, let me interrupt you because this is the headline which I take from your Substack, we ll tell people how they can get it, everyone should subscribe.  ""Facebook and Twitter dodge a 2016 repeat, and ignite a 2020 firestorm.  The companies have said they would do more to stop misinformation and hacked materials from spreading.  This is what the effort looks like.""  And then reading from your article, Roose, who we just mentioned, notes that, ""Politicians and pundits have hope for a stronger response from tech firms ever since Russian hackers and WikiLeaks injected stolen emails from the Clinton campaign at a public discourse.""  This is, again, a quote from him.  ""Since 2016, lawmakers, researchers, and journalists have pressured these companies to take more and faster action to prevent false or misleading information from spreading on their services.""  The Podesta emails are not false. MT:I know.  Exactly. CH:They re real. MT:It s a bait and switch.  And this has been going on all across the media landscape but they re--with their doing that, they re saying in the public memory, what happened in 2016, they ve used the word disinformation or misinformation so many times that people associate those emails with words like that.  And so they can get away with saying, well, we have to do something to stop this misinformation or disinformation even though, again, we re talking about things that are real and true but just happened to the public through a means that is, you know, in their minds infamous.  So, again, the traditional mission of an organization like The New York Times and they exist specifically because they have their resources and the training to hunt out whether or not stuff like this is real.  They re just skipping straight past that and going to the editorial pronouncement about how this is--this is the kind of material that should be suppressed and this is what suppression looks like and good for them.  And that s the angle that they re taking right now, which is really extraordinary.  It s an--it s an amazing change. CH:Yeah.  No, it is.  It is seismic.  So Matt, I want to ask you about this podcast, because I don t think it s unrelated.  Caliphate, where it s a five-part series.  They interview--turns out that he s an imposter.  You call it correctly stuff of snuff films.  He s talking about stabbing.  He claims to have been an al-Qaeda murderer, and putting people up on crosses and putting daggers in their hearts.  It s quite amazing, again, coming out of the culture of the Times.  It s completely false.  It s rabidly salacious.  You know, the worst part of ""of tabloid, trash television,"" but I think that that s a piece of what s happening here.  Can you--can you talk about that especially back up a little bit for people who aren t familiar with what happened? MT:Sure.  Yes.  So they had--I think it was a six-part podcast series and it was--the lead reporter was a pretty celebrated figure in the organization.  It s--Rukmini Callimachi is I think her name, right?  And she s been a four-time finalist for the Pulitzer.  And they interviewed this character who s a Canadian-born or a Canadian citizen who s a Muslim who claimed to have gone over to Syria to become a soldier for ISIS.  And in the process, he accumulated all these tales of committing horrific acts of violence and the podcast was essentially based around these graphic descriptions of what he had done while he was in Syria and in other parts of the Middle East.  And then he was arrested by Canadian authorities for perpetrating a hoax under a law that I guess that we don t have an analogous law here in the States but when the--when The Times were presented with this news that their main source in this very acclaimed, you know, significantly trafficked podcast had turned out to be an imposter, their immediate reaction was to deflect and say, actually, one of the purposes of the podcast was to determine whether or not he was telling the truth, which is completely untrue.  There s, you know, as Erik Wemple of the Washington Post put it, who incidentally who s been one of the few media critics who s actually done real work on this kind of stuff lately, you know, they spent the entire podcast really bolstering the credibility of this source and not calling it into question at all.  And incidentally, what would be the worth of a podcast like that if there was any question at all about whether or not it was true?  It would be a completely--complete waste of time to do the story.  So they undermined themselves rather than do what I think a traditional news organization would do which is to say, okay, we might have a problem here, we re going to look into it.  If necessary, we ll bring in, you know, an outside auditor to see what went wrong and we ll--and we ll come out with--and with all the results of our investigation later and in the meantime, we apologize.  That s exactly what they didn t do anymore.  They ve learned that audiences now forgive this kind of thing.  And if you just pretend that it didn t happen, you can move along and just go to the next thing and that s now kind of more the modus operandi which, of course, wasn t what it was when you worked there and I think when a lot of other people entered, you know,  The Times back in the day. CH:Well, they will forgive it only if it bolsters the dominant narrative. MT:Right.  Exactly.  Yes. CH:If it doesn t bolster the--they won t forgive it. MT:Right. CH:That s why you don t--that s why they ve pushed to the margins of the media landscape. MT:Right.  And you too obviously.  Yes. CH:Yeah.  So on the one hand, you have the Podesta emails, the Biden, which is real, being denounced as fake.  And you have a complete hoax defended with--let s call it what it is, fake news.  It s sensationalist garbage being perpetrated by The Times.  I just want to read I thought was a really great paragraph you wrote.  You said, ""Now the business…"" you re talking about journalism, ""…has reversed course acting like a gang of college freshmen who just read Beyond Good and Evil for the first time.  Objectivity is dead.  There s no truth.  Everything is permitted.  The cardinalate has gone from pompous overconfidence in its factual rectitude to a bizarre post-modernist pose where nothing matters, man, and truth is whatever we can get away with saying.""  I mean, it s funny but it s not.  That is really what we re documenting here.  What do you think the pressures were?  Is it commercial?  I think to an extent it must be commercial.  The Times has bled advertising.  It s stumbling into a new media environment that it s not familiar with.  What do you think is causing this?  Or maybe it s just moral posturing?  I don t know. MT:I think it s a combination of all of those things.  Clearly, the commercial aspect of it is--plays a strong role because just to take an example of that Caliphate podcast, here you ve got somebody giving a firsthand account of crucifying a human being and that s what you got to do is stay and, you know, to trend on Twitter for like eight seconds now.  You know, you need to come up with stuff like that just to keep getting a requisite number of clicks, just to not lose audience.  You need to come up with sensational material because everybody s hyping things left and right.  So there s enormous pressure now to stretch the envelope in--of sensationalism in ways that probably didn t exist when, you know, when I first went into the business or you did but that s only part of the picture.  The other part of the picture is there s been this segmentation of audience where, you know, the Pew Center did a study this summer where they asked people, you know, what their political affiliations were, if your primary news source was Fox, you know, 93% of those people were Republicans.  If your primary news source was MSNBC, 95% of those people were Democrats.  With The New York Times, it was 91% of those people who are Democrats.  NPR, 87%.  So all of these news outlets are talking to one audience exclusively.  And so they ve learned that if they screw up and they make a mistake about the other audience, it s not going to matter.  So the--I think whether consciously or unconsciously, it sped up their fact-checking process or made it looser because they know it doesn t really matter.  You know, if we make a mistake about this, it s not going to come bounce back at us.  If we--if we predict that something is going to happen, if we say the walls are closing in and they don t, that s not going to bounce back.  So I think that s a major, major part of this picture. CH:Great.  When we come back, we ll continue our conversation about the disintegrating media landscape with journalist and author Matt Taibbi.  Welcome back to On Contact.  We continue our conversation about the disintegrating media landscape with author Matt Taibbi.  And before we go on, tell viewers how they can get your Substack columns. MT:Sure.  Yeah, you can go to taibbi.substack.com.  And it s a--most of the material s free but there--there s extra material for subscribers so I appreciate the support in this sort of new independent media landscape. CH:Great.  Well, we have to support the few journalists who are left.  Is this--is this the death of journalism?  I mean I expected that you had a great book ""Hate INC."" where you had Sean Hannity on one side of the cover and Rachel Maddow on the other.  I don t hold the commercial networks to the same kind of standards, maybe it s nostalgia that I do for The Times.  But you can t--if you can t communicate across these divides, which is essentially what s happening, then the country just bifurcates into warring antagonistic tribes, which is exactly what happened in Yugoslavia because you had competing ethnic groups seize rival media outlets, and speak only to their own and demonize the other.  But to see this happening in the New York Times and in the Washington Post, is this--is this the end of traditional media? MT:I think temporarily.  I mean, I do believe.  I mean, I have maybe a naive hope that some canny entrepreneur will realize that there s a screaming need out there for a new kind of media product.  I mean, I hear it every day from people sending emails that I just wish there was a place I could go to find out just what happened, stripped of all the editorializing, right?  Like, people want the old school, boring, you know, when, why, where, how, you know, third person dead voice that we used to get in all of these--in all the newspapers.  And they re not getting that anymore because everything is highly charged, and highly politicized, and tailored for a political audience.  So I do believe that if somebody was smart, they would create that outlet and there is--there is some interesting stuff going on in independent media.  But for the time being, the major commercial media outlets have become completely bifurcated, as you put it, and it s literally balkanizing American society.  I think that you make a good point there.  I don t think it s an accident that we re seeing groups of people who are marching around carrying AR-15s really on both sides of the aisle, and that s because we ve developed different realities for different groups of people.  And that s very dangerous. CH:It is.  It s very dangerous.  And I will just throw in there that nobody in Yugoslavia thought they were going to have a war.  You had people dressed up in camos posturing, but once that violence starts, we saw glimpses of it in Portland.  Once people start getting killed, you open a Pandora s box that you can t control.  I want to talk about the tech platforms because they played a major role, I think very pernicious role in all of this.  You ve also written about them.  Can you talk about that? MT:Sure.  And a couple of years ago, when Alex Jones was thrown off basically all of the tech platforms in what was actually in hindsight kind of a remarkable moment because it was clearly coordinated.  All of the major platforms, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Spotify, YouTube, they all kind of kicked off Jones at the same time, and sort of liberal America cheered.  They said, ""Well, this is a noxious figure.  It s--this is a great thing, finally someone s taking action.""  What they didn t realize is that we were trading an old system of speech regulation for a new one without really any public discussion.  You and I were raised in a system where you got punished for speech if you committed libel, or slander, or if there was imminent incitement to lawless action, right?  That was the standard that s in--that the Supreme Court set.  But that was done through litigation.  It was an open process where you had a chance to rebut the charges.  That is all gone now.  Now basically there s a handful of media--of these tech distribution platforms that control how people get their media, and they ve been pressured by the senate which has called all of the--their CEOs in and basically ordered them, we need you to come up with a plan to prevent the sowing of discord and prevent the spreading of misinformation.  And now I think this past week is when this has finally come into fruition.  When you see a major reputable news organization like The New York Post, you know, with a 200-year history, is now locked out of its own Twitter account.  And that story, which has not been disproven, it s not disinformation or misinformation.  It s being suppressed in the manner of, you know, know the same way you--it would be suppressed in a third world country, which is--I think, I don t know what you think, I think it s a--it s in a remarkable kind of historic moment for us. CH:No, it is.  It s a very frightening historic moment.  These tech platforms are on--they re not neutral.  They re on one side of the political divide.  And the danger, I ll get your opinion on this, in my eyes the danger is that if Trump loses the election, this platform and this old media, and however--whatever their veracity is about their critiques of Trump, will essentially be completely written off.  You won t be able to reach that segment of the population at all. MT:Right.  Yes, exactly.  And I know some of the people who are high ranking executives at some of these companies and I ve had discussions with some of them in the last year or so.  And one of the things that I ve tried to communicate is there s no possible way to institute a standard of something like, you know, factual reliability that can be done in an even-handed way without an awesome amount of people going through the, you know, each and every submission.  And they re clearly not doing that.  They re clearly creating rules and selecting out some content that they don t like and allowing other content that they do like go through.  There s no possible way to do it either with AI or with manpower in any kind of even-handed way.  It s automatically either going to be a mess or a double standard, right?  Like whack-a-mole or a double standard.  And I think in a post-Trump reality, the danger is that we end up with essentially like a one-party informational system where there s going to be approved dialogue and unapproved dialogue that you can only get through certain kind of fringe avenues.  And that--that s the problem because we let these companies get this monopolistic share of the distribution system.  And now they re exercising that power. CH:And what, you know, I know you lived in Russia.  I worked in Eastern Europe, what are the political consequences of that because you ve seen it? MT:Yeah.  I mean, I lived in kind of both versions of Russia.  I lived in the Soviet times.  I was--I was--I was a student during that time and then I was there when the media freed up.  And a lot of my former colleagues, Russian colleagues, worked under the Soviet system.  And there--the similarities are pretty striking because what ends up happening is it s really more of a psychological form of censored--censorship than it is an over top-down kind of pressure.  The reporters end up knowing ahead of time what kinds of things they can write and what kinds of things they can t write.  And if you re worried about where the edge is with Facebook or Twitter, and your career depends on not being deplatformed by those companies, you just won t go anywhere near where you think the line might be.  And already, you know, somebody like myself or, you, or Glenn Greenwald, or you know, even, you know, reputable journalists, we re already within range of, you know, a possible suppression effort, which I would have said was outlandish even six months ago.  And that s no longer the case.  So, that--that s what you worry about is where the--where it s the fear is going to take hold of the business very quickly. CH:Well, doesn t the fear come from the fact that critics, such as you, have credibility and therefore are dangerous because as the kind of moral center erodes within journalistic organizations, critics such as yourself who point it out become--they re no longer a nuisance.  They essentially can be fatal.  And so you--the suppression becomes much heavier. MT:Yeah.  And that s the reason why I think this censorship is so self-defeating.  It s such a mistake.  You know, normally, if you just allow this kind of speech to go to, you know, be distributed freely, it s not going to have the impact.  But what ends up happening in societies like the Soviet Union, you know, nobody would use a Russian newspaper or a Soviet newspaper for anything but, you know, lining a birdcage or anything like that, but people would treasure the Samizdat documents that would be handed from family to family because that was the actual truth.  And that s going to end up happening in this country if you have an approved dialogue that you can--you can get, you know, on Facebook and Twitter.  And then there s this other thing that s forbidden, people are going to flock to that which is why I don t understand the commercial decision that companies like The New York Times and the Washington Post are making to throw off the thing that made the most valuable, which was this institutional credibility they had for being a kind of political third party that was neutral.  That was what gave them all their value and they re throwing it away and I don t understand it. CH:I think they re throwing away because they re bleeding money and they re frightened. MT:Well, sure. CH:I want to read a--I want--I mean you re right, it s not--it s ultimately self-immolation.  You write, ""The people who run this country have run out of workable myths with which to distract the public, and in a moment of extreme crisis, have chosen to stoke civil war and defame the rest of us, black and white, rather than admit to a generation of corruption, betrayal, and mismanagement.""  And I think part of it is that organizations such as the New York Times do not shine a light on the corruption, the betrayal, and the mismanagement. MT:That s right.  And so they--they ve had to come up with some other thing to sell to the public as the reason for all of our troubles, after the election of 2016 where internally, within The New York Times, we now know there was a tremendous kind of come to Jesus moment where they realized we didn t see this coming, how could we have possibly let that happen?  We have to hire more people like Bret Stephens because we re so out of touch with conservative America.  That s what they were saying internally but externally they spent all their energy building their newsroom around this fictitious Russiagate story rather than doing things like let s look at what s happening with poor and middleclass American and the massive amounts of insecurity that have--that led to Trump s election.  They didn t do that at all, they went with this other story.  And then later, when that story fell apart, they kind of threw their weight behind the 1619 Project and other--and other issues because that was preferable to telling dangerous truths about kind of the neoliberal economics and other issues that were really concerning the country.  So, that s the danger that you get is that when they re afraid to tell you what s actually happening, they end up coming up with alternatives that are--that are not convincing. CH:Right.  The 1619 Project, which they then denied what they wrote, that America… MT:Right.  Yeah.  Exactly. CH:That was also kind of bizarre. MT:Totally. CH:Great.  That was… MT:Totally. CH:That was Matt Taibbi, one of the few real journalists left on the disintegrating media landscape in the United States.  Thanks, Matt. MT:Thanks, Chris.

"31 Oct, 2020",Trouble ahead? Stores boarded up across US over fears of widespread looting and riots around election (PHOTOS),"Cities across the United States are battening down the hatches in anticipation of violence around the presidential election. Stores are being boarded up throughout the nation and the National Guard is preparing for activation. With election day now looming large, business owners in major cities including New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles and Denver have boarded up their stores in the hope of avoiding being targeted by looters and rioters. Washington, DC is forecast to be the epicenter of the unrest as polling in the highly contentious contest between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democrat nominee Joe Biden draws to a close on Tuesday. Left-wing activists are descending on the US capital for a mass demonstration on polling day and security experts have predicted that violence could erupt no matter what the result of the vote shows. A collection of activist groups including blacklivesmatter and Shutdown DC are planning an eight-hour demonstration in the shadow of the White House. Shutdown DC protesters have revealed that they are rehearsing“election meltdown simulations”and have plans to indefinitely occupy public spaces. Activists from both sides of the political divide have also announced plans to monitor polling stations on election day. The police will also be out in force as DC Metro Police Chief Peter Newsham pledged that the entire department will be working on election day. The force also splurged tens of thousands of dollars on riot-control munitions after unrest throughout the summer depleted its stockpile. In New York City, the police issued an order that trash cans be removed from key thoroughfares to prevent them from being used as projectiles. A similar directive was issued to restaurants, telling them to remove chairs and tables that have been used for outdoor dining. On Friday, workers were busily boarding up stores on the city’s iconic Fifth Avenue thoroughfare. Several states are preparing to deploy the National Guard in a bid to clamp down on unrest. The reserve military force is already patrolling the streets of Philadelphia after multiple nights of protests and looting following the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr this week.

"30 Oct, 2020",‘COON CHIP ACTIVATED’: Rapper Lil Wayne hit with racist backlash after becoming latest black entertainer to support Trump,"Rapper Lil Wayne became the latest black entertainer to endorse or show willingness to work with President Donald Trump – an offense deemed such a betrayal by leftists that all the rules on racist attacks went out the window. Lil Wayne met with Trump in Miami on Thursday to discuss the president’s “Platinum Plan” for investing $500 billion in black communities. The rapper tweeted a picture of himself with the president and praised Trump for taking action to help black Americans. Just had a great meeting with@realdonaldtrump@potusbesides what he’s done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership. He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done. 🤙🏾pic.twitter.com/Q9c5k1yMWf The Twitter rage mob was inconsolable in response.“Lil Wayne’s coon chip activated?”black comedian Jessica Frye tweeted on Thursday night. Another offended observer said,“Uncle Tom’s Cabin must be Lil Wayne’sfavorite book.” Lil Wayne’s coon chip activated?? Another commenter claimed to be ahead of the crowd in spotting the rapper’s tendency to get along with white people:“Everyone is so late to the party that Lil Wayne is a self-hatingUncle Tomdust mite.”Writer Bryson Henry called Lil Wayne“a contrarian coon”who is now“full-fledged, just like Mr. (Kanye) West,”while comedian Karlous Miller was simply in disbelief that“Lil Wayne did that.” I can believe Lil Wayne did that. Lil Wayne was already a contrarian coon now he full fledged just like Mr West West set off alarm bells with the skin-color police when he met with Trump in 2017 and again the next year, sitting down with the president in theOval Office. Little did critics know then that West, now a presidential candidate himself, was starting a trend of wildly successful rappers cozying up to Trump. Another rapper, Ice Cube, was hit with backlash earlier this month after merely agreeing to work with Trump on the Platinum Plan. He was forced to explain himself in a CNN interview, saying that he’s on no one’s team and is willing to work with“whoever is in power”to help black Americans. Still, CNN called Ice Cube’s willingness to help the president set investment priorities“ahuge mistakewhich hurts the entire African American community.” Also this month, rapper 50 Cent said he will vote for Trump because Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden’s policies would cause his taxes to skyrocket. Although 50 Cent has been critical of Trump, he, too, was hit with angry reactions. White comedianChelsea Handler, who dated 50 Cent in 2011, said,“I had to remind him that he was a black person, so he can’t vote for Donald Trump.” Even for 50 Cent, Lil Wayne’s move on Thursday was too overtly pro-Trump.“Oh, no Wayne,”he tweeted.“I would have never took this picture.” oh no 👀 WAYNE🤦‍♂️, I WOULD HAVE NEVER TOOK THIS PICTURE.#bransoncognac#lecheminduroipic.twitter.com/SZAQ0Zm7Ks It’s easy to see why leftists such as Handler would be disturbed by popular black entertainers voicing support for Trump. Democrats have long relied on their stranglehold on black votes for electoral success. Trump won just eight percent of the black vote in 2016, but that was better than Mitt Romney’s six percent in 2012. Trump’s approval rating among black voters jumped to 46 percent from 25 percent earlier this month, according toRasmussenReports polling. The president hopes to have swayed some black voters by working to reform the criminal-justice system and boost funding to historically black colleges. Lil Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., has more than 34 million followers on Twitter. He has sold more than100 millionalbums globally – the fourth-most in history among rappers, according to SA Hip Hop magazine. The New Orleans native has courted racial controversy in the past, such as when he denounced blacklivesmatter in anABC interviewin July. He said his views on race were shaped partly by an incident in which a white policeman saved his life after he accidentally shot himself in the chest at the age of 12. Not all of the reaction to Lil Wayne s Trump endorsement was negative. Conservative black author Melissa Tate said she sees it as another sign of black people waking up to the fact that they have been“used and abused”by Democrats for 50 years. She added that“white liberal supremacist”Handler is“about to remind Lil Wayne thathe is black.” For 50 years they do nothing for blacks, but Every election cycle they manage to convince Black people that the #1 issue they face is racism. They pose as the savior from racism to get the votes, then proceed to do NOTHING but sell victimhood that has crippled black mindspic.twitter.com/GaFBIHoALA Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"28 Oct, 2020", Blue lives matter : NASCAR fans revive Bubba Wallace racism row as driver unveils fresh car design to honor police killed on duty,"Fans have praised NASCAR ace Josh Bilicki after he turned his car into a replica police cruiser ahead of a race, creating a contrast to the blacklivesmatter -daubed symbolism that Bubba Wallace gave his vehicle earlier this year. American Bilicki revealed that his car will be dedicated to police officers killed in the line of duty at Sunday s Cup Series race, featuring more than 230 stars painted on the hood to represent cops reported to have been killed while working so far this year. The 25-year-old has collaborated with police welfare organization The Wounded Blue, which helps officers who have been wounded or injured. ""We came up with the idea to make the car look like a cop car because NASCAR began with bootleggers outrunning the police,""Dan Block, the president of Bilicki s sponsors, Insurance King, toldTMZ. This weekend at Martinsville Speedway, we’re honoring all of the police officers who lost their lives in 2020 with this special Insurance King / The Wounded Blue paint scheme. Featured on the hood will be 230+ stars in remembrance of those fallen officers. Read more by clicking the link in my profile. A post shared byJosh Bilicki(@joshbilicki) onOct 27, 2020 at 12:27pm PDT *crashes into blacklivesmatter car * BLUE LIVES MATTER ""We ended up going one step further with this paint scheme and are dedicating this design to each police officer that lost their life in 2020."" The replica features police lights, a striking black and white base scene and the slogan ""Protect & Serve"" written across its side. ""Blue lives matter,""replied a self-declared opponent to the blacklivesmatter movement on Twitter, referring to a year in which figures have shown that the number of officers to have died has risen from 147 in 2019 to 234 in 2020, although Covid-19 has accounted for 130 of those deaths. ""At the start of the season, NASCAR was parading Bubba Wallace to the front of the line for a fake noose story,""said another, recalling the decision by the only black driver in the competition to compete in a blacklivesmatter -themed car in June. ""When the ratings collapsed, they started pandering to win fans back, but remember who NASCAR originally threw under the bus for political correctness. Let them hurt some more."" Once Nascar s TV ratings start inching up on a regular basis, the aging demographic changes and the attendance stops shrinking I will know Nascar and Bubba are on to something. Until then I will leave all the nebulous numbers to the newbies. Oh sir...your racism is showing. This is exactly why every sport needs athletes like Bubba, & people are done apologizing for interrupting your perfectly manicured white system in this NASCAR & any other predominantly white sport. Get used to seeing what the real world looks like Well, at the start of the season@NASCARwas parading@BubbaWallaceto the front of the line for a fake noose story. When the ratings collapsed they started pandering to win fans back, but remember who nascar originally threw under the bus for PC. Let them hurt some more. The move was announced days after Wallace s sponsors, Root Insurance, released a cinematic new advert featuring the social justice campaigner, declaring that ""progress owes no apology"" and that they were ""proud to support unapologetic change"". Wallace is about to switch to NBA legend Michael Jordan s 23XI Racing, but fans rowed over new figures that showed a potential broadening of interest in the sport because of the partnership. ""Bubba isn’t bringing people to NASCAR more than he is just playing off the current social drama and blacklivesmatter cr*p,""said one. ""His people are interested in how much sh*t he can stir up, not about becoming NASCAR fans. The next thing will be along soon to replace him."" The critic received short shrift from some quarters.""Oh sir, your racism is showing,""hit back one observer. .@joshbilicki.@NASCARthis is freaking awesome. I could care less about NASCAR, but I will check out the race just to see this car run. A great tribute to our fallen American police officers who are very under appreciated these days. Love this car! I was looking for a new favorite driver. ""This is exactly why every sport needs athletes like Bubba. People are done apologizing for interrupting your perfectly manicured white system in NASCAR and any other predominantly white sport.Get used to seeing what the real world looks like."" Another called the move ""awesome"".""The sport needs personalities like [driver] Hailey Deegan and Bubba Wallace to expand interest outside of their core viewership and maintain and grow a healthy fanbase,"" they argued. ""Every new eyeball adds Revenue in the forms of TV contracts, track sponsors and tickets and team and driver sponsorship."" Speaking about the advert on Thursday, Wallace claimed:""This means a lot to me for many reasons but mostly the most human of emotions: acceptance. ""We also share a vision of inclusion. It’s a positive change I try to represent, even when I fall short. But that vision should never be apologetic."" RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"27 Oct, 2020","‘Double standard’ indeed: NYC police officer suspended for saying ‘Trump 2020’, but for cop crimes it s a whole different story","The New York Police Department has suspended an officer for blasting “Trump 2020” from his loudspeaker, triggering union rage over the “double standard” protecting cops who support blacklivesmatter . And what about those who kill? The Sergeants’ Benevolent Association skewered departmental bosses on Twitter over the suspension of a pro-Trump cop who’d used his squad car loudspeaker to briefly promote the president, lambasting the decision as “unnecessary & way over the top” on Sunday. The NYPD has a history of officers making political & outside the norm statements & ignoring it. Suspending, this officer is unnecessary & way over the top. Chief of Departrnent took a knee with protestors no disciplinary action was issued. What if the officer supported Biden?https://t.co/svklwHo5Eypic.twitter.com/6TfUO397mO As the union pointed out, the NYPD’s own department chief Terence Monahan had “taken a knee” with blacklivesmatter protesters back in June, and “the NYPD has a history of officers making political & outside the norm statements & ignoring it.” The decision to suspend 70th Precinct officer Arthur Becerra without pay – a move that apparently took less than 24 hours to consider – had less to do with his actions than his opinions, the union implied. Terence you said nothing when Captains & Chiefs took a knee with violent protesters who injured members of the NYPD. You say nothing to those who sing & dance in uniform. Now your little itsy-bitsy balls are in DeBlasio’s palm & you tweet nonsense. Relax & take a knee!https://t.co/MHC0Hk1Bpjpic.twitter.com/kUjrq5Uu5o Mocking Monahan’s closeness with Democratic politicians and “violent protesters who injured members of the NYPD,” the SBA made short work of his moral posturing. The union has made numerous public statements in support of President Trump, accusing the democraticparty of “abandoning” police. How the NYPD rolling up in Black communities these days (on my block): “Trump 2020. Put it on YouTube. Put it on Facebook...”Aight MFers... it’s on TWITTER TOO! BI-DEN! 👋🏿😂#Vote#nypdfinest#bidenharris2020pic.twitter.com/hmXdY8ivbM Becerra was caught on film on Saturday by two onlookers repeatedly stating “Trump 2020” over his squad car’s loudspeaker in Brooklyn’s Flatbush neighborhood. At least one of them actively goaded Becerra, responding to the cop’s Trump cheerleading with “Go f*** yourself, you f***ing fascist.” The officer matter-of-factly repeated the slogan, daring the witness to “Take a picture, take a picture, take a video. Put it on YouTube, put it on Facebook. Have some fun…tough guy, tough guy.” NYPD officers are forbidden from expressing political views, including, but not limited to, endorsing candidates, while on duty. Monahan and NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea were quick to condemn the footage when it emerged, with Shea denouncing Becerra’s behavior as “one hundred percent unacceptable.” The rapid response to Becerra’s pro-Trump display offers a deep and troubling contrast to the NYPD’s response to serious crimes, however. Accountability has long been an issue for the department, whose “bad apples” have historically been aided and abetted by police unions that protect them from prosecution. Mayor Bill de Blasio, elected on a promise to “fix” the department (among other things), has instead allowed many of the abuses of his predecessor Mike Bloomberg – who referred to the NYPD as his “own army” – to continue. Rather than dismantling Bloomberg’s “racist” policies, he brought back former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. Bratton s controversial “broken windows” policing has been alternately credited with cleaning up New York under then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani and slammed for laying the groundwork for the racially-biased “stop and frisk” tactics that were only reined in following a judge’s order in 2014. Daniel Pantaleo, the NYPD officer who strangled Eric Garner to death using a banned chokehold while supposedly trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes in 2014, wasn’t even suspended until August 2019, when an administrative judge suggested Pantaleo be fired for the killing. Instead, he spent five years pushing paper on desk duty, pulling down a six-figure salary as protesters demanded he be jailed for Garner’s murder. The unions resolutely sided with Pantaleo, essentially blaming Garner for his own death – even though the asthmatic, obese 49-year-old was not visibly resisting arrest and (perhaps even more importantly) did not actually have untaxed cigarettes on his person when he was killed, though he was arrested for selling them in the past. Ramsey Orta, the man who filmed Garner’s killing, later sued the city for allegedly exacting vengeance on him via spurious charges, questioning why Pantaleo was a free man while the person who’d documented the murder was locked up. The SBA and other NYPD unions have long opposed reform efforts, declaring nearly every move aimed at restraining departmental excesses to be an attack on police, usually by Democratic politicians, that will allow criminals to run wild in the streets. On Tuesday, Trump called for Becerra to be allowed to return to work, pointing to the significant uptick in crime in the city since the start of 2020 – including a 279 percent increase in shootings that saw 53 New Yorkers injured by gunfire this week alone – and insisting the NYPD be allowed to do their job.

"27 Oct, 2020","Wayne Dupree: Is Joe Biden’s lackluster campaigning because of his physical or mental frailty, or won’t his handlers let him out?","Trump’s busy final week dwarfs Biden’s, who has chosen to keep it light, allegedly because of Covid-19 fears. If he can’t take the pace of an election campaign, how would he cope with the strain of being in the White House? Wayne Dupreehas been to the White House to talk to President Trump about race relations and appeared at election events for him. He was named in Newsmax s top 50 Influential African-American Republicans in 2017, and, in 2016, served as a board member of the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump. Before entering politics, he served for eight years in the US Air Force. His website is here:www.waynedupree.com. Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow Covid-19 has been an excuse for Joe Biden not to have large rallies even though many ‘liberal’ voters are marching through the streets in their resistance to the Trump administration. Let’s face it, the blacklivesmatter organization along with Antifa aren’t worried about rising coronavirus numbers and neither are many Americans on the ground – I’ve seen them. I don’t know if it’s because of Biden’s alleged mental or physical frailty or if his handlers won’t let him out, but this is not the way to run an election. It almost seems like he’s really suffering physically and Democrats are trying to hold him up until after the election. How can any person possibly think he can handle the most stressful job on Earth for the next four years? Although Biden is defending his light campaignschedule, anyone running for president or vice president who doesn’t even care enough about the American people to spend the last days with a vigorous schedule to push for votes shouldn’t even be allowed to run. Every presidential campaign in my lifetime has worked hard for their election, win or lose, and I haven’t seen that from Joe. At the very least, they visited every city and state that mattered in their election. Joe has spent most of his time inPennsylvania, as if that were the only state he needs. President Trump and VP Pence have always been there for their constituents, in 2016 and now. They work extremely hard to make sure they visit as many voters as possible to ask for their votes. It’s the right thing to do. If the Dems are hoping that President Trump beats himself, they’re delusional. Rasmussen’s three-day rolling average of Trump’sapproval– with two days of post-debate polling included – puts Trump at 52 percent (54 percent when you count the ‘shy’ Trump voters). His disapproval is 46 percent – at or near his all-time low. As I try to wrap my head around this common sense, it just doesn’t make sense. This is the worst possible time for Biden and Kamala Harris to seemingly ease their campaign schedules. Again, this has to be more than Covid, yes? They are wearing masks and being tested almost daily. Their early voting and mail-in ballots aren’t meeting theirprojections, or at least we don’t think so. In some states, Republican early votes are actually running AHEAD of Dems. And all the polls confirm that Republicans will do most of their voting on Election Day. The Dems need to build up HUGE early majorities, and they’re not getting them. Trump supporters have already demonstrated that they’re willing to wait in line for his rallies – even for a CHANCE to see him. So they’ll be the ones willing to wait in line on Election Day. Biden supporters won’t even cross the street for his rallies. No way will they be patient enough to wait to vote. Here comes the Red Wave! And here’s a twist to the Biden scandal. Lots of sources say Joe was paid to provide influence but never state what that influence was. All threebusinessesBiden was associated with, in Ukraine, China, andKazakhstan, were fossil fuel energy companies. Joe Biden is publicly against all fossilfuelsand stated he would ban it and stop giving them subsidies. What if his public stance is to reduce American production to increase demand from foreign fossil fuel companies and increase their income? Maybe that is the deal that was worked out in return for all that money. Then Trump came in and threw a giant wrench in it by making us energy independent and most likely hurting these companies. When you vote, remember how hard Trump worked to speak to America and how little energy Biden used up! One thing is for certain, Trump is out there fighting for us as a whole, even though some Americans don’t want to admit it. His policies have been a breath of fresh air. Fighting a pandemic and Democrats, he is still implementing peace deals and helping America. On a side note, please be aware that there are widespread attempts to disrupt voting and intimidate voters by groups of people who don’t want you to vote. Videotaping voters, setting ballot collection boxes on fire, setting up fake ballot collection boxes, ballots from some groups being eliminated at a higher level than from other groups, convoys of trucks honking and yelling near voting sites forcing voters to wend their way through, confrontations at voting sites between masked and unmasked voters, on and on. Don’t let them stop you. Voting is a sacred right in this country, and some groups want to change the will of the people because they know they can’t win fairly.

"27 Oct, 2020", You re a piece of TRASH : NFL star DeAndre Hopkins DENIES risking lives while INSULTING Donald Trump supporters from FERRARI,"NFL star DeAndre Hopkins has admitted making an obscene gesture at a caravan of Donald Trump supporters on his way to a game, although he has denied driving dangerously after being accused of swerving wildly in and out of traffic. Wide receiver Hopkins was on his way to help the Arizona Cardinals edge past the Seattle Seahawks when his journey was interrupted by a procession of Donald Trump supporters, frustrating the social justice campaigner as he tried to reach the State Farm Stadium. A Twitter user claimed that the 28-year-old had driven his Ferrari recklessly while gesticulating at the group showing their support for the head of state ahead of the US presidential election next month. ""My eight-year-old son was in one of the cars you were swerving in and out of as you were...trying to cause an accident,""wrote the man. Deandre Hopkins flipped off a bunch of Trump supporters on his way to the stadium then put up 10 catches for 100 yards and a TD. Legend.pic.twitter.com/L1m2aijJfN @DeAndreHopkinsMy 8 yr old son was in one of the cars you were swerving in and out of as you were disrupting the PHX Trump Train drive and trying to cause an accident.

""You re a piece of trash. Make your political statements but you put people at risk today."" Hopkins was caught on camera on the road ahead of his starring role in the 37-34 victory, catching ten passes for 103 yards and a touchdown. ""I guess I got in between a train or a bunch of cars that I wasn t supposed to be in between,""Hopkins later told a podcast. ""They were honking the horn at me to tell me to get out of their way, and I didn t. ""The guy in front of me stepped on his brakes and tried to stop dead in traffic.

""If I was in a Ferrari speeding, I don t think you would be able to take a still picture of me."" Hopkins was one of several high-profile players to take part in a video message urging the NFL to ""listen to your players"" over issues of racism in the days following the killing of George Floyd in May. In the same month, he showed his support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick – whose invention of the gesture of taking a knee before games has infuriated Trump – by posting a photo of himself in a t-shirt branded with the message ""IMWITHKAP"". April Garcia, who had been driving in the rally, said Hopkins had been speeding and was identified after supporters thought they recognized him as an NFL player and began to investigate on their phones. Nothing says systemic racism and oppression like a black man on a 2 year $54,000,000.00 contract, in a Ferrari, flipping the bird to white people. How many black NFL owners are there??🤔 Seems like the love is mutual. ""It s scary when they are coming up fast and swerving into you,""she toldAZ Central, adding that other ""intolerant"" people had hurled water and objects at the caravan. Hopkins actions received a mixed reaction on social media.""I am in love with this...as if I needed more reason to follow this guy,""said one fan. Another added:""DeAndre Hopkins driving a Ferrari giving the double bird to a pro-Trump caravan is the type of content I need."" A critic retorted:""Nothing says systemic racism and oppression like a black man on a two-year, $54 million contract, in a Ferrari, flipping the bird to white people.""

"24 Oct, 2020","75th Anniversary of the United Nations: Old problems, new challenges and global solutions","24 October has been traditionally celebrated as United Nations Day. This year marks the 75th anniversary of this most reputable global organization. ByDmitry Medvedev, who served as Russia’s president from 2008 to 2012 and prime minister from 2012 to 2020. He has been deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation since January 2020. Despite all the problems and crises that the United Nations and its member states have faced over these years, it is hard to disagree that it is largely thanks to the international legal and political mechanisms established by the UN Charter that we managed to avoid plunging into an all-out third world war and deal with many critical issues when shaping the post-war world order. Unfortunately, the world has not always learned the right lessons from the problems brought by the 20th and 21st centuries. I will remind you that, when the UN founding members, including the USSR, created the Organization, they formulated its mission, which includes three principles: commitment to a stable and safe world, promotion of human rights and building a more just world order. Yet, only a year after the Organization was established, yesterday s allies in the Anti-Hitler Coalition, who had given freedom to the peoples of the continent, found themselves on opposite sides of the barricades in the Cold War, which had a tendency to heat up from time to time. Today it is impossible to imagine that for almost 40 years the world lived under the constant threat of a nuclear war that could wipe out the whole of humanity. The UN bodies have put in a lot of work to make the world step back from the abyss, to launch mechanisms for settling conflicts within a legal framework. Thus, disarmament, reduction and elimination of all stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction constitute one of the main goals of the United Nations. The Disarmament Conference, established by the decision of the first Special Session of the UN General Assembly in 1978, developed and adopted a number of fundamental international agreements designed to ensure security of peoples, alleviate international tensions and build confidence among states in the matters of handling nuclear weapons. The USSR played a special role in that process. Today there is an urgent need for us to continue working towards this end. We hope that the UN Security Council will hold a face-to-face summit of the nuclear five to discuss the most pressing problems of humankind. The issue of prolongation of the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the New START Treaty) also needs to be promptly resolved. We have already articulated our position concerning the extension of this crucial document. At the same time, we need not only to ensure reduction of the existing arms but also to minimize the risks of possible new threats. In this vein, Russia has declared a moratorium on deployment of new missile systems in Europe and other regions. We expect to see our Western partners take reciprocal steps. We also call for conclusion of a legally binding agreement with all space powers to place a comprehensive ban on militarization of space. The relevance of this approach was confirmed by the adoption of the Russia-sponsored resolutions of the General Assembly concerning the prevention of the arms race in outer space and its use in accordance with international law. Regrettably, in spite of all the efforts to maintain peace, we are still witnessing unilateral aggressive actions and blatant attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states undertaken, inter alia, by the U.S. and its NATO allies. In many corners of the world, hotbeds of military confrontation persist, people are dying every day. As a rule, it takes a coordinated legal assessment of a situation by the UN Security Council to understand who is right and who is wrong, who is the aggressor and who is the victim. Otherwise in the era of fake news, falsification of facts and hybrid warfare, there is the risk that black would be presented as white, unlawful as legitimate, and true facts would be buried behind catchy TV images and social media posts. In this regard, ensuring security in the global information space is of particular importance. The international cybersecurity architecture should be fit to respond to modern challenges as well as cater for future technological progress. Unfortunately, the increasing digitalization is bound to result in a growing number of crimes in the information environment (and there has been a considerable increase in such crimes during the new coronavirus pandemic). Russia has repeatedly called on the world community to agree on new mechanisms to address cybercrime and ensure stability in the information domain. Earlier, the 73rd UN General Assembly session adopted by an overwhelming majority a Russia-proposed resolution that established, inter alia, a negotiation mechanism for addressing international information security issues. This resolution is especially relevant given that cross-border challenges can only be tackled effectively with the active involvement of the entire international community. UN bodies could serve as a platform for elaborating a universal international treaty based on generally recognized principles and norms of international law and consistent with common interests in the information domain. Such instrument should be helpful in maintaining international peace and security and preventing the use of technologies for purposes inconsistent with international law. No other international organizations, let alone military alliances, can undermine the UN principal organs monopoly on the expression of the will of the world community. The dilution of the responsibility for global security, attempts by various organizations and certain nations to stigmatize states and governments and decide the fate of the world would invariably throw us decades back. The typical scenario of unlawful interference in the internal affairs of states is still being repeated: the propagation of social division, support and arming of the opposition to overthrow the present government with a formal reference to democratic values. In 2003, the international coalition led by the U.S., including several NATO countries, invaded Iraq. Under the pretext of combating international terrorism and searching for weapons of mass destruction, the legitimate president of the country Saddam Hussein was deposed and executed, the ""authoritarian state"" was ruined and the ""truly democratic"" was established.  Everyone knows how it all turned out. Another example is the fact that since 2012, the U.S. has provided secret military support to insurgents in Syria in cooperation with NATO countries. Attempts to undermine the role of the UN and establish a certain ""community (club) of democratic nations"" instead of it are also of particular concern. Such ideas do not unite but divide humanity, contribute to international tensions and ultimately lead to direct confrontation. The United Nations was created alongside the development of the human rights concept and the humanistic turn in inter-state cooperation in all kinds of fields. Human rights issues have now permeated almost all agendas of UN bodies, from environment and personal data protection to cybersecurity and biotechnology. Today, every state has legal safeguards in place against discrimination, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary interference in private life. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, along with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on civil and political rights provide a foundation for the international recognition and entrenchment of human rights. The United Nations is guided in its work by the principle of promotion and protection of the rights enshrined in these documents. René Cassin, one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Nobel Prize winner, once said that one of the salient characteristics of the Declaration is its universality: it applies to all human beings without any discrimination whatever; it also applies to all territories, whatever their economic or political regime. In addition to the recognition of rights, ensuring due balance between different human rights categories is of primary importance. For this reason, the Soviet Union pointed out the need to enshrine an extensive list of social and economic rights when working on the Universal Declaration. This point proves valid today. The current world economic recession caused by the global pandemic pushes states towards revisiting their values and prioritizing the protection of people s lives and health as well as human rights to guarantee decent and safe existence. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed that political freedoms as such can do little to save people s lives. There is a need for efficient and affordable medical and social care systems, nation-wide sanitary safety programs, utmost coordination of efforts at all levels of public authority. Strong states that proved capable of mobilizing their economies and political institutions to fight back the pandemic, succeeded in overcoming its consequences and preserved millions of lives. The approach that prioritizes the protection of human rights above other things seems well justified given that the central motto of the first post-war decades was ""Never Again"". Civilized nations, on whose behalf the UN was created alongside other international organizations that came into existence in the late 1940 s through 1950 s, were called to prevent the horrors of World War II, genocide, war crimes, abuse of fundamental human rights and freedoms, humiliation of human dignity from happening ever again. They saw the best solution in restricting, as much as possible, the government s involvement in social development, absolutizing private and individual freedoms, continuously expanding the scope of subjective rights, often to the detriment of public interest. At the same time, it is national states that have been assigned, in the context of the so-called ""positive obligations,"" with increasingly significant obligations not only to refrain from violating an individual s rights, but to ensure their respect as well as provide ""good"" governance. Concerns regarding the possible restoration of totalitarian ""superpowers"" similar to fascist Germany forced governments in many countries (first of all in Europe) to agree to a considerable limitation of national sovereignty and delegation of powers to supranational structures. Results proved very different. Moreover, we cannot disregard three things. First of all, a weak state is unable to ensure the rights of its citizens and protect itself from global threats. The dramatic transformation of the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich vividly illustrated that the provision of broad democratic freedoms, without backing them up with economic growth, welfare, and the state s ability to proactively address extremist manifestations, would inevitably lead to the marginalization of the political agenda, upsurge in crime, vulnerability of democratic institutions and, consequently, the threat of a collapse of the state or its sliding into dictatorship. Unfortunately, Russia, too, was on the verge of anarchy and state collapse twice in the last century (in 1917 and 1991). Both times, the collapse of the state was accompanied by the slogans of universal freedom and democracy. Today, we see examples of failed states unable to build a stable political system and give their people confidence in the future (including those among the former Soviet states). Second, pluralism and unlimited freedom of speech are not enough to ensure stable development of mankind. Today, just as in 1945, millions of people, both in developing countries and in economies that are considered to be ""developed"", live below the poverty line, struggling to meet the basic needs for themselves and their families and feeling like outcasts cut off from the achievements of modern civilization. The blacklivesmatter movement, which has swept across the western world in 2020, clearly demonstrates that there is an unsatisfied global demand for a just world order, for bridging the gap between the rich and the poor and for access to adequate healthcare, modern education and decent wages for all, regardless of color or social status. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare inequalities in dozens of countries. Many people were left to fend for themselves. These circumstances prove that social justice cannot be restored only through developing the market economy without interference from the state (according to the principle of ""laissez faire"") or through generous but sporadic charity projects. This requires involvement of the state, a sensible fiscal policy, a responsible and stable government, and a clear vision of the long-term social and economic development goals. States need to take decisive steps to adapt their national economies and political systems to the modern challenges. The state s key mission today is to make sure that every citizen can feel like a full member of society, to provide equal opportunities for personal fulfilment and to foster people s sense of self-worth and confidence in the future. Technology is evolving at a rapid pace, but people remain the same as they were dozens, hundreds and even thousands of years ago. Family and friends, dreams of a better future for their children and the desire to be heard and understood by others have always had the central place in their lives. Phenomena such as fear-mongering, deliberate creation of enemy image and heightened hysteria in the media and social networks are extremely dangerous and should be dealt with by, among others, the United Nations entities. For centuries, people in our countries have lived in constant fear of an enemy, of an imminent threat of war. Yet a stable world cannot be built upon fear and mistrust. Fear must ultimately give way to hope.  As far back as 1953, the Second Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld said: ""To build for man a world without fear, we must be without fear. To build a world of justice, we must be just"". Third, not a single global challenge can be solved without re-establishment of the primacy of international law based on the consensual will of states. International treaties, signed and ratified by sovereign states, continue to be the main source of international law. The UN Charter belongs to that exact category of sources. Norms of international law can only draw legitimacy from democratic procedures set out in national constitutions and the clearly expressed will of nations to adhere to an international instrument. Today, more than ever, we need to stick to these approaches, preserve the unique architecture of the United Nations, accommodate each other s interests and respect each other s national circumstances. In this context, sincere commitment to cooperation, mutual help and consolidation could facilitate the achievement of the goals enshrined in the UN Charter. In August 2020, after the explosion in Beirut, Russia immediately sent its emergency personnel to Lebanon to provide aid to the victims. At the height of the pandemic, Russia provided large-scale support to Venezuela, Iran and other countries, supplying medical equipment and personal protective gear. Russian military personnel were sent to provide medical assistance in Italy, and we continue to engage in humanitarian efforts in Syria. Speaking at the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, President Vladimir Putin offered to provide Russia s coronavirus vaccine—Sputnik V—to all UN staff for free. Amid the continuing global epidemic, we need to guarantee unhindered supply of food, equipment and technology to the most affected areas. Russia has consistently called for renouncing trade and financial restrictions on humanitarian shipments worldwide. Political considerations should not affect cooperation to save lives. Our country has always upheld the interests of peace and security, being open for dialogue and search for global solutions to the most pressing challenges. Today, we are making our contribution to a better future for our planet and to the development of human civilization. We should not forget that the UN has been founded as an organization that should seek solutions to the most pressing global problems and stand guard of the interests of peace and security. It is designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, ensure compliance with international law and improve living conditions for people. Ultimately, these are the high ideals that the United Nations has been created to attain. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"23 Oct, 2020",Woke Tech goes full Biden as Expensify warns 10 MILLION customers that a vote for Trump may mean ‘CIVIL WAR’,"The expense report processor Expensify is doing its best to scare its 10 million customers into voting for Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying anything less is “a vote against democracy” and may lead to “civil war.” David Barrett, CEO of the San Francisco-based company, said in anemailblasted out to all of Expensify s customers on Thursday that the US is""facing an unprecedented attack on the foundations of democracy itself.""Anyone who votes for President Donald Trump, votes for a third-party candidate, or doesn t cast a ballot is showing that they are""comfortable standing aside and allowing our democracy to be methodically dismantled, in plain sight,""he added. Barrett didn t detail how he thinks Trump is destroying democracy, saying only that he believes the president is trying to suppress votes. As a provider of expense-management software, he said,""Expensify depends on a functioning society and economy. Not many expense reports get filed during a civil war. Barrett made no effort to reconcile his doomsday views on Trump with the fact that Expensify is able to rank as the world s most widely used and fastest-growing expense-management platform while the current president is in charge. Ironically, his mass email may jeopardize that position more so than Trump s re-election. In reaction, Newsmax TV host John Cardillo said he s deleting his Expensify account and will never use the software again. The Hill TV host Saagar Enjeti called Barrett s email""completely insane for a $100+ million financial services company and the logical end point of woke capital."" So@expensifyCEO literally emailed every single registered user/customer with a plea to vote for Joe BidenCompletely insane for a 100M+ financial services company and the logical end point of woke capitalhttps://t.co/0wQhyP0GZL Deleting@expensifyand never using them again after their founder/CEO blasted this e mail out to customers this morning.pic.twitter.com/QAbYcqoqQs Another Twitter user said that, when he notified Expensify that he intends to cancel his long-time subscription, the company s response was,""To clarify, are you leaving because you dislike democracy and don t want to defend it, or is there something else?"" Expensify’s response to my email notifying of my intent to cancel my long time subscription: “To clarify, are you leaving because you dislike democracy and don t want to defend it? Or is there something else?"" Barrett’s email could go beyond losing some customers and alienating voters with woke capitalism. Other Twitter commenters pointed out that making a political statement to a verified list of 10 million customers has great value to a campaign, and that value would likely need to be reported as an in-kind contribution under USelection laws. Is this even legal? Isn t expensify making a very large unreported campaign donation with this political advertisement? Is it legal for them to use private customer data to do so? I m going down this legal rabbit hole right now. State privacy law violations. GDPR Europe violations. This has global legal implications. I would be intensely curious to know what outside counsel in his/her right mind rubber stamped this. This company is over. Finished. ""Woke tech is shooting for new heights,""tweeted Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Network tech policy group.""Does this count as an in-kind contribution?"" ""I love watching woke CEOs tank their companies,""said another observer. I love watching woke CEOs tank their companies Others supported Barrett s approach, however, saying he may benefit from""free advertising""generated by the email controversy. It’s not insane. Yes, it alienates non-Democrat customers but it brings the company an incredibly high level of free advertising. The number of customers he attracts simply through name recognition will dwarf the number of customers who leave. There were also executives who applauded Barrett s move. CleanChoice Energy CEO Tom Matzzie, who promotes blacklivesmatter on his Twitter profile, called Barrett a""hero.""Another blacklivesmatter -backing entrepreneur, Thomas Fuchs of the software firm Noko, thanked Barrett and said,""I m in the same boat – I depend on a functioning society on being able to run my business."" Thank you for speaking out. As the owner of a small business I’m in the same boat—I depend on a functioning society on being able to run my business.

"20 Oct, 2020",Dying laughing: Facebook demonetizes satirical website Babylon Bee for inciting violence with Monty Python joke,"Facebook has demonetized Christian satire site the Babylon Bee, saying even after a manual review that an article which used a popular Monty Python bit to skewer Senate questioning of Trump’s Supreme Court pick “incites violence.” The social media behemoth told Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon that it “stood by” the decision to not only remove the article but demonetize the Bee’s entire page on Tuesday, insisting the piece – headlined “Senator Hirono Demands ACB Be Weighed Against a Duck To See if She Is a Witch” – “incites violence,” Dillon revealed on Twitter. So after a manual review, Facebook says they stand by their decision to pull down this article and demonetize our page. I m not kidding. They say this article ""incites violence."" It s literally a regurgitated joke from a Monty Python movie!https://t.co/U9B6tTOj6N Facebook also ordered the Bee to edit its article, which described Hawaii Senator Hirono subjecting Supreme Court nominee Barrett to the deliberately nonsensical “witch test” from the classic comedy film ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’, and “not [to] speak publicly about internal content reviews,” Dillon continued, concluding with a cheeky “Oops, did I just tweet this?” A blacklivesmatter leader said that if change doesn t happen, they ll ""burn down this system."" That s allowed on Facebook. You can quote it. You can link to it. But a Monty Python joke about burning a witch at the stake? That s incitement to violence. 🤡 show. “In what universe does a fictional quote as part of an obvious joke constitute a genuine incitement to violence?” the CEO tweeted, contrasting Facebook s actions with the tolerance shown toward  blacklivesmatter protesters who threatened to burn down ""this system."" Hirono, in the article, delivers the whole Monty Python monologue, which concludes that “logically, if Amy Coney Barrett weighs as much as this duck I found in the reflection pool outside, she is a witch and must be burned.” But the article ends well for would-be Justice Barrett, as Senate Majority Leader “Mitch McConnell entered the room and put a stop to the proceedings” before the nominee could be weighed against the duck using “the bathroom scale from Jerry Nadler’s office.” While the lines would be familiar to anyone who’s seen the film, or anyone who’s ever spent time with anyone who’s seen the film, Facebook’s reviewers apparently fell into neither category. Their missing sense of humor stuck in the craw of many social media users, however, including Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), who has become one of the most vocal critics of Big Tech censorship in Washington. .@Facebooknow censoring the@TheBabylonBeeand effectively kicking them off the Facebook network. For making a joke that called out Dems’ religious bigotry against#AmyConeyBarrett. The fix is inhttps://t.co/gqJKyJhGpv Serious Christian persecution coming from Facebook. Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Wikipedia..the list goes on concerning the Tech companies that have embraced evil. Others commiserated by sharing the unremarkable circumstances that had led to their own banning… i was suspended for saying that Elizabeth Warren should take a long walk off a short pier. they said it ""incites self harm"". I m not joking either, it happened. Facebook demonetized my entire page for posting a video showing Kyle Rittenhouse helping an injured protester in Kenosha and noting that he didn’t show up there with any malicious intent. And gave me a community guidelines violation & are threatening to completely delete my page …or suggesting the only logical response. pic.twitter.com/R9xl82PuBW We will not be editing the article to get our page s monetization reinstated. We will, however, be talking to the media about this. Send your inquiries my way: seth@babylonbee.com Dillon, for his part, vowed he would not be editing the article. The conservative-leaning Bee’s humour has often gone unappreciated by the Big Tech platforms that host it. Twitter suspended its account entirely in August amid what many insisted was a targeted purge of accounts satirizing the “woke” Left, before reinstating it hours later amid public outcry. Meanwhile, liberal fact-checker Snopes has repeatedly targeted the Bee with its disinformation warnings, arguing this is necessary because –accordingto a less-than-scientific “study” conducted last year – a hefty minority of Republicans believe its articles are real. Unscientific as that study may have been, the Bee’s articles have fooled such influential figures as President Donald Trump, who retweeted a headline claiming “Twitter shuts down entire network to slow spread of negative Biden news” last week – though admittedly this was during a period in which Twitter was blocking all attempts to tweet a New York Post story unfavorable to the Democratic candidate. 92 percent of political contributions made by Facebook employees over the 2020 campaign period have gone to Democrats, according toOpenSecrets.org. Some 99 percent of donations from Twitter employees had gone to the same party. Facebook, Twitter, and Google have fervently denied earlier accusations of bias against conservatives despite evidence to the contrary - including multiple whistleblower reports, hidden camera videos, as well as internal company documents. Some media influencers even insist Facebook is actually slanted infavorof them. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"19 Oct, 2020","I’ve been an ethnic minority politician, & here’s why I know non-white shortlists for MPs will simply make racial divisions worse","A Lib Dem parliamentarian s bill to legalise race-based candidate lists is undemocratic, patronising & will undo the decades of progress Britain has made. Christina Jordanis a Malaysian-born British politician. She served as a Brexit Party Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England from 2019 to 2020. I was so irked by an elected public servant’s recent declaration, that paraphrasing a great man’s quotation was the only response I felt could touch my exasperation. My comments will not attract much attention in the crowded Twitterverse, but I felt that if there was even half a chance that a few might notice, then I should use the opportunity to do so. In 1954, while trying to explain what it was to be a parliamentarian, Winston Churchill defined it as,“The first duty of a Member of Parliament is to do what he or she thinks in his or her faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. Their second duty is to their constituents, of whom they are the representative but not the delegate.” Instead of understanding the primal importance for representative democracy exemplified by those words, on October 14, an elected Member, the Lib Dem Wera Hobhouse, proudly affirmed that she would present a bill that went against that very goal. She wants to make it legal to select politicians based solely on the colour of their skin. Ludicrously, she claims that the bill is necessary to beat racial injustice. Today I am presenting a Bill to Parliament that would make it legal to draw up all-ethnic minority shortlists for the selection of candidates in elections.We cannot hope to beat racial injustice unless the people making decisions genuinely represent our diverse nation.pic.twitter.com/vhGm92zrMX Her attempt to allow non-white only shortlists will do the exact opposite. Bringing forward a bill which makes it legal to discriminate against candidates just because they are white is undemocratic and downright patronising. It implies that non-whites are incapable of being selected on merit unless Caucasians are sidelined. It is ‘one insignificant step for national unity, one giant leap for racial division and disharmony’. Any candidate selected on this basis will be open to justified ridicule. It is extraordinary that in our democratic country, in the mother of parliaments, a place less happy parts of the world can only eye enviously, we have elected politicians seeking to legalise racial discrimination. Quotas do not work. Short lists that favour colour over merit do not work. Parliamentarians who push these divisive agendas should not work for us. Far from eradicating or helping racial injustice, this bill would only serve to stoke the flames of resentment. Our country should, and must, demand that only the best are sent to Westminster. We want candidates to prove to the electorate that they deserve their place and have been chosen on merit, not on a nod and a wink. The message must be that discrimination is always wrong, whatever the skin colour. I fear that some politicians are taking our country on a destructive path in their crusade to right historical wrongs. In trying to put their new world order into practice, they risk tearing the very fabric of our peaceful and cohesive society. They are saying to our citizens that they are not to be trusted when it comes to fairness and justice for all. Diversity, equality and anti-racism does not mean we divide people of different races, beliefs, backgrounds, religions and ancestry into two groups, i.e. white and non-white. I write as a person of colour, an immigrant, a democrat and a believer in fair play. I am a staunch and loyal citizen of this great country. One who believes that the majority wants to see us move forward together. But how can we when we have politicians telling us that we cannot be relied on to look out for, and after, each other? It is bad enough that some, through all-women shortlists believe that we should be politically divided by sex. Now they claim only non-whites can better represent non-whites. What message does that send to our friends, peers, children and visitors to our shores? When I stood for election in 2019 for the European Parliament, I naively believed that I had faced optimal vitriol and abuse. Nothing would ever match the overflowing vat of bilious hate my colleagues and I faced. I had not appreciated however, that in pushing back against our country’s navel-gazing, knee-bending, finger-pointing, supine acceptance that white people are privileged racists and black/brown/mixed/Asian/none of the above-skinned people are victims in dire need of saving, I have leapt into a den of hate and scorn. I do not parade the following messages to elicit sympathy. I just want to expose the fact that, as a woman of colour who rejects victimhood labels, I receive pretty vile abuse from both the white and non-white contingent of the virtue brigade. In the last few days alone, some of these have included: You’ve sold your soul because you’re so desperate to be accepted by the Right yet no matter what you say your skin colour will always be the major factor. So desperate to be liked by the flag waving mob that she’ll happily throw her self-respect and morals out the window. Christina is just a hypocrite and a sell out to get the flag waving bigots on her side. How can such a dark face have such a white name? This “christina” seems to be of Asian descent and claims to be an immigrant, not sure how she ended up with an English name Pulling up the ladder after her to prevent immigrants from entering the country. Impressing her bully boy, flag shagging fash mates. Off you pop good immigrant, probably have some bootlicking that’s overdue to show how grateful you are to be here. These, and other comments, only make me more determined to stand up for our country against the monotonous, wearisome and never-ending bashing she undeservedly receives. Creating division is not the answer. Most of us live outside the political, institutional and media bubble and we get along just fine, thank you. Think your friends would be interested?

"18 Oct, 2020",‘Still think Antifa is just an idea?’ Black conservative activist gets tooth knocked in clashes during free speech rally (VIDEOS),"Conservative protesters in San Francisco accuse Antifa activists of violently attacking their rally. Police officers were injured at the event as well. A“free speech rally”was held at the United Nations Plaza on Saturday. Some demonstrators wore red ‘Make America Great Again’ Trump campaign hats and carried pro-police ‘Thin Blue Line’ flags, as well as US flags. The activists came to decry what they call censorship of conservative views and stories by social media giants, like San Francisco-based Twitter. Counter-protesters rushed to the scene as well, quickly outnumbering their rivals. Carrying makeshift shields and ‘Smash fascism’ banners, they threw plastic and glass bottles, and heckled the conservative rally organizer, Philip Anderson, as he was trying to make a speech. Philip Anderson says his “free speech rally” is canceled, he claims he was attacked before the event. Speakers were shouted down by a large group of counter-protesters.https://t.co/O49E8GRH2xpic.twitter.com/hcuQgZ2e02 Videos posted on social media show loud activists trailing Anderson, chanting“Get the f**k out!”and“You’re not welcome here!”as the man was going to the stage. At one point, a black-clad man suddenly jumped on Anderson, delivering two powerful punches to his face. Antifa formed a mob to attack a black man. You couldn’t make this up.pic.twitter.com/Zowc3LcuX7 Anderson, who was covering his mouth after the attack, was then forced to climb over a barricade to escape the crowd. Antifa cheap shot in San Francisco on a black guy. Just an idea says@JoeBidenpic.twitter.com/pD1Db7W4RM Shortly after the attack, Andersonpostedphotos of his bloody mouth with a front tooth missing and another hanging loosely. He wrote that Antifa assaulted him“for no reason.” In avideoapparently filmed from a hospital bed, Anderson addressed Trump’s rival in the presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden.“I wanna ask you, do you still think, after seeing this, that they’re just an idea? Okay, I want you to answer that question, Joe Biden,”he said, referring to a statement Biden made during a televised debate with Trump last month. When asked by Trump to condemn the violence by Antifa members, Biden claimed that Antifa was“an idea, not an organization.” A scuffle erupted at the corner of Market and Polk between two men, one wearing a MAGA hat, who walked into a crowd of counter protesters. Punches and water from bottles were thrown as the crowd chased him down Market St. toward 11th st. and a police officer line.pic.twitter.com/NfKeuTR2Vw Other scuffles broke out at the United Nations Plaza as well, with one video showing an alleged Antifa member hitting a person with something resembling a baseball bat. According to local media, at least one Trump supporter was taken away in an ambulance. San Francisco Police said several people, including three officers, were injured during the event. Officers suffered from pepper spray and“caustic chemicals,”according to astatement. At the same time in Washington DC, a young Trump supporter claimed she was assaulted by blacklivesmatter activists for bringing a ‘Trump 2020’ flag to the Women’s March.

"14 Oct, 2020","Not enough black venture capitalists? What’s next, not enough black war criminals? Fetishizing surface diversity insults us all","The obsession with ‘diversity’ that has taken the US professional sphere by storm is not only misguided, but insults minorities, who don’t need white guilt to excel. It’s also running out of steam, as its latest incarnation hints. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram The problem with the venture capital industry, a sub-sector of private equity in which deep-pocketed investors bankroll cash-hungry startups, is the lack of black representation – orso saysventure capitalist Frederik Groce, who co-founded BLCK VC in 2018 to increase black representation in the sector. Surfing the wave of 2020’s diversity-mania, Groce launched the Black Venture Institute on Tuesday with two other big-name venture capital firms and the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. The Institute’s stated goal is quintupling the number of “black check writers” over the next three years, aiming to train 300 students to“create a network of black investors and advisors who can begin writing checks to make investments,”according to TechCrunch’s glowing profile of the project. It’s the latest of many pearl-clutching efforts to solve the ‘problem’ ofblack underrepresentationin finance without reassessing the hideously flawed economic system itself, and like its predecessors, fails to ask the obvious question of why black people are ‘underrepresented’ in an odious sector which is disproportionately responsible for American inequality. There’s no indication in any of the promotional materials for the Black Venture Institute that Groce, BLCK VC, or any other affiliate has taken the time at any point in the last two years to ask black professionals why they aren’t diving headfirst into the shark-infested waters of private equity. It’s just assumed from the start that their underrepresentation is the fault of big bad Whitey blocking the door to the control room. But without talking to those professionals, it’s impossible to tell whether it’s truly white gatekeepers who are to blame, or whether black Americans are deliberately shunning an industry thatis responsiblein large part for the death of the American middle class. Denounced by many financial experts as adestructive force, private equity’s modus operandi consists of asset-stripping troubled firms and of firing their workers while trading on their good name. Ten of the 14 largestretail bankruptciessince 2012 have been companies controlled by private equity or hedge funds, and the sector is responsible for over 1.3 million lost jobs over the past decade. With black families disproportionatelyimpactedby the 2008 crash and stilllagging behindin a ‘recovery’ that mostly benefited upper income tiers, why would talented black professionals want to participate in the destruction of their own society? The oversimplified explanation that Wall Street (or Silicon Valley’s venture capital ecosystem, or other industries) is run by a WASPy, calcified ‘old boys’ club’ who’d rather keep all the good jobs for themselves than let in bright young talent with ethnically-diverse backgrounds, is so often held up to justify initiatives like the Black Venture Institute that it’s become self-parody. The World Economic Forum was nearly laughed off the internet when it recently tried to claimhikingof all things was racist, and after five months of corporations swearing fealty to blacklivesmatter , it’s hard to find an area that hasn’t been scrutinized for the presence of systemic racism. And there’s no doubt that racism remains a problem in certain areas of American society, particularly the justice system. But the claim that white people are keeping black wannabe vulture-capitalists out of private equity’s carrion corral makes little sense. Venture capitalists are, first and foremost, capitalists. If they can get away with paying black employees (or women, or other traditionally-disadvantaged groups) less to do the same work as their white male counterparts, they’re going to bring as many as possible on board in order to save a few bucks. Google heretic James Damore’s now-infamousmemoon gender in tech argued that attempting to give women equal representation in Big Tech was pointless, since women’s psychological attributes supposedly ill-suited them for such roles. Damore was pilloried for his alleged misogyny, but his point that not all groups want the same thing out of their professional lives was valid. Claiming to ‘know better’ than black Americans what career path they should take is, ironically, racist, just as arguing women should put aside their dreams and go into STEM to ‘even things out’ is misogynist. At some point in the American crusade for social justice, equality of opportunity – the noble notion that all people deserve the same chance to succeed – was replaced by equality of outcome, and the country is the worse for it. Those who defend equality of outcome must understand that to fully achieve it, the runner gifted genetically with powerful, muscular legs must be deliberately handicapped to render him equal with the wheelchair-bound individual with congenitally withered limbs. The naturally bright must be dumbed down to match the naturally dim, since there’s only so much education can accomplish. Equality of outcome is a death sentence for humanity, and it’s the one 2020’s faux-Left has latched on to as the best thing for the species. The rigid, illogical insistence on exact proportionality of racial, ethnic, gender, and other minorities in every area of life glosses over the inconvenient reality that cultural, psychosocial, and even genetic factors might predispose certain groups to certain life paths. A social butterfly is unlikely to want to sit in an office coding late into the night, while an empath will feel uncomfortable rejecting a Silicon Valley dreamer’s business proposal for venture capital funding. Failure to create equality of opportunity – say, by ensuring public schools in poorer districts offer the same quality of education as private schools in tony suburbs – cannot be corrected later in life by enforcing equality of outcome. It’s impossible to ignore that as American institutions have been swept up in diversity fever, talking up the superficial opportunities they offer traditionally disadvantaged groups, the problem of income inequality has only grown. This, the real inequality at the heart of American society, is never addressed by the diversity fetishists, who perhaps fear that calling it out would be biting the hand that feeds them. Diversity cheerleaders will ignore this in favor of heralding the number of women in senior positions in the military-industrial complex, or praising the first black US president for unleashing more drone strikes on brown people than his white predecessors. But it’s not clear what problem will be solved by replacing the private equity vultures currently feasting on America’s carcass with darker-skinned equivalents, or why such a swap-out should be celebrated. Until superficial diversity is matched by diversity of thought, the system will remain broken – no matter the skin color or gender of the ruling class with its boot on the necks of the people.

"13 Oct, 2020","Not wrong, just irrelevant: Mitt Romney’s attempt to tone-police US politics falls on deaf Democrat ears","After Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) bemoaned the “hate-filled morass” of US politics, angry Democrats practically raced to prove his point by calling him an apologist for President Donald Trump and a Nazi enabler. Literally. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT.

Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic “I’m troubled by our politics, as it has moved away from spirited debate to a vile, vituperative, hate-filled morass that is unbecoming of any free nation – let alone the birthplace of modern democracy,”Romney said in a statement on Tuesday morning. Tacitly praising Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, he repeatedly called out Trump – but also House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann – for the words and deeds he said contributed to the sad state of affairs. My thoughts on the current state of our politics:pic.twitter.com/oYY4zlX6ZP America is“so angry, so mean, so violent,”Romney lamented.“It is time to lower the heat. Leaders must tone it down,”he added, as“the consequence of the crescendo of anger leads to a very bad place.” The stunning and brave declaration that bad things are bad and good things are good, however, did not win Romney the praise he might have hoped for. Instead, the failed Republican presidential candidate from 2012 found himself bombarded by hateful replies from Democrats, offended at the notion they could in any way be compared to Trump. Time and again, they blasted Romney for claiming the“false equivalence”of “both sides,” arguing that Trump’s supposedly existential evil can’t possibly be compared to Pelosi ripping up his State of the Union or Olbermann’s YouTube rant. BOTH sides are bad, the President of the United States and YouTube commentator Keith Olbermann After all, the former MSNBC host onlycalledfor Trump and“his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators”to be“prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society,”and urged Democrats to“chase… Trump and the MAGAts [maggots] off the stage and then try to clean up what they left.” Olbermann himself was entirely unapologetic, calling Romney an“enabler”of Trump along the lines of Franz von Papen – Adolf Hitler’s deputy in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1934. Mitt, I called Trump a terrorist because Trump IS a terrorist. And you’re his enabler. And if you don’t like the state of politics, fix the root causes - your party, and@realDonaldTrump.If not, go read up on Franz von Papen. He was not alone in this sentiment. Hundreds of responses to the Utah senator, from blue checkmarks to fresh accounts with no followers, insisted on the same thing: Trump is THE problem, nothing else. “We get America back when Republicans walk away from Trump. Not before,”asone userput it. Other Resistance Twitter activists undermined that very argument, however, by seamlessly turning back the clock to 2012 and reaching for the rhetorical bludgeons used by the Obama-Biden presidency to clobber Romney’s challenge at the time: He’s a racist birther! He called 47 percent of Americans moochers who don’t pay taxes! Here’s a photo of Mitt Romney accepting Donald Trump’s endorsement after years of promoting unfounded racist conspiracy theories about the birthplace of President Obama.pic.twitter.com/buP3D9jRUl The man who smeared nearly half the country as moochers has words on divisiveness and civility. Bear in mind that Romney went from one of the original NeverTrump Republicans in 2016 to seeking Trump’s endorsement for his Senate run in 2018 – then turning on Trump the minute he was elected and embracing every liberal cause since, from Russiagate to blacklivesmatter . Willard M. Romney was literally the only senator in US history to vote in favor of impeaching a president from his own party, endorsing one of the articles of impeachment against Trump in February. None of that mattered to online Democrats. Dozens of other replies made clear that Romney must openly endorse Biden right now and vote against confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court before he might be considered remotely acceptable – and probably not even then. Twitter conspiracy-mongerBill Palmeractually argued that Romney is“worse than Trump, because Romney knows better, and he still chooses to do the wrong thing.”The Utah senator, Palmer said,“pranced around the battlefield and lectured everyone about their tone instead of picking a side”in the“battle to save American democracy.” The greatest irony in this entire episode is that Romney absolutely has a point about the present state of American politics being a hate-filled swamp. However, because the observation is coming from him – a feckless opportunist who learned nothing from his political career – it is guaranteed to fall on deaf ears. Biden himself couldn’t even remember Romney’s name during an airport interview on Monday, calling him“the Mormon”instead. That seems strangely fitting, somehow.

"12 Oct, 2020",How to kill a thriving metropolis in 7 months: NYC’s Covid-19 failure is a vicious spiral directed by a sadistic political regime,"Seven months into the pandemic, as many US states inch back toward ‘normal’, New York is in the grips of a crime wave, reinvigorated lockdowns, and widespread fear of pretty much everything. Thank local government. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram New York City has lost billions of dollars in tax revenues on tourism, music, art, theatre, restaurant dining, and everything else that once fueled its mammoth economy over the seven-month Covid-19 pandemic shutdown. It’s in worse shape than most US states, and unlike many others, its continued misfortunes are largely of its own making. The shuttering of the city’s iconic Broadway theaters alone has sent hundreds of thousands out of work and signaled to both wealthy city inhabitants and out-of-town visitors that their cash is better spent elsewhere. Theaters announced just weeks ago that performances would be cancelled through March 2021, and the Metropolitan Opera House canceled its entire season through 2021. New York’s famed restaurant scene isn’t faring any better. The ‘lucky’ establishments are finally - as of two weeks ago - allowed to operate at 1/4 capacity indoors, which given the amount of money they’ve lost over the last 6 months is a band-aid on a cannonball wound. The unlucky ones in New York Governor Cuomo’s newly-invoked ‘red zones’ must continue to seat patrons outdoors in the freezing cold as summer gives way to a damp, chilly autumn. To make matters worse, there s no Thanksgiving parade, no Black Friday shopping, no fun allowed. Perhaps pandemic-fearing wealthy New Yorkers would have left anyway, taking their tax dollars with them. But tourism might have filled some of the gap. What city in its right mind would turn up its nose at $11.5 billion, the estimated total spent by out-of-town visitors to the city’s famed theatrical productions alone? Why leave that money on the table, especially when the virus that had held the industry hostage for months has been steadily on the wane? With Governor Cuomo demanding billions in relief from the federal government to make up an economic shortfall that stems from his own policies, surely he can’t afford to keep the state (and its largest city)’s biggest draws closed down indefinitely? Pleas to cancel rent have fallen on deaf ears, and starving artists’ efforts at workarounds have been squashed. Cuomo even passed an executive order in August - with the coronavirus “peak” safely receding in the rearview mirror - to ban ticketed live performances, and has revoked liquor licenses from bars that failed to serve food with their takeaway drinks. Is it any wonder the city is hemorrhaging cash, as well as the creative and interesting people who put it on the map? To understand the motivation someone like Cuomo could have for destroying the city whose economy once kept his state alive, it helps to grasp the concept of the “self-licking ice-cream cone,” a phrase that has been attributed to NASA scientists but can in general describe any system that exists for little reason other than to continually justify its own existence. Every politician who’s ever harbored dreams of becoming a totalitarian dictator has embraced the directive “never let a crisis go to waste,” and both Cuomo and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio are true believers. After attaining unprecedented powers through the emergency measures passed under cover of Covid-19, they aren’t about to let them go quietly, and have seemingly set up a perpetual motion machine of crisis that - accidentally or otherwise - ensures NYC will remain forever financially in the hole. The type of cash lifelines that might get the city back on its feet - as a post-9/11 tourism blitz did - are blocked (no one s going to visit a New York where dancing, drinking, and taking in a show are off-limits). Average New Yorkers, too, are paralyzed by the thought of the scary virus lurking just outside their door, ultimately learning to love their captors, Stockholm-Syndrome-style - if this month’s fawning New Yorkerprofileof Cuomo is any indication. With the virus no longer nearly as much of a danger as it was back in April, the would-be dictators have put together what looks for all the world like a diabolical plan to empty out the city and take advantage of artificially-lowered property values. First, the criminals are unleashed. Bogged down with a directive to enforce the ever-growing range of social-distancing and mask-related offenses, New York’s police are no match for the flood of actual criminals released into the streets under statewide “bail reform” that all but guarantees the “catch and release” of muggers, rioters, and other criminals whose offenses stop short of rape and murder. Even more miscreants have been paroled early due to Covid-19-related overcrowding excuses. Next, the threats are broadcast 24/7 over every media outlet. CCTV videos of horrific, unprovoked attacks on old women, small children, everyday middle-aged types, a jazz pianist, a would-be rape victim on a subway platform - the point is made that everyone is a potential victim. The solution is presented as a paradox: do New Yorkers who’ve just spent months demanding the city rein in its police want more cops patrolling the streets? Surely that’s not very “woke” of them. While they hem and haw, the rampage continues, and the debate ends with helpless, fear-crazed city dwellers throwing up their hands and begging Cuomo and de Blasio to Do Something, Anything, to Make the Bad Men Stop. Both men play dumb - there’s nothing they can do! Better get used to crime, or flee! The plight of the subway is instructive. The city’s legendary 24-hour train system was ordered to close down service from 1am to 5am back in May, ostensibly for “cleaning” because of the virus. The homeless people who’d taken to sleeping on the cars in the wee hours were a health risk, New Yorkerswere told, and the city promised free transit alternatives for those whose jobs required them to be able to move around during those times (promises which in many cases did not materialize). Ridership, already severely curtailed due to pandemic fears, was down 90 percent at one point, sending the already cash-strapped system deep into the red. Now, we’re told, the lack of people (and cops) on the subway has made it a predator’s playground. The lack of witnesses makes it easy for unscrupulous crooks to nab a wallet, attack an innocent commuter, and otherwise strike fear into the hearts of those New Yorkers who still think there’s a future for their city. “We need more cops!” the law and order types cry, only to find the MTA is deeper in the financial hole than ever and de Blasio is leery of upping the police budget. Presumably, the next move will be to decrease operating hours still further, guaranteeing the downward spiral continues indefinitely. A tourism and entertainment-based city without so much as a public transit system is, quite simply, doomed. The only question, then, is why are de Blasio and Cuomo so determined to run New York into the ground? Cuomo’s “economic reopening council” is guided by private equity partners who actually make their profits off the carcasses of dead and dying businesses, so it’s no mystery why he’s eager to see restaurants and theaters crash and burn. Private equity stands to make billions on all the vacant office space and abandoned properties from city institutions forced to pull up stakes. If Cuomo does what his deep-pocketed donors tell him - he’s not called “Governor 1 Percent” by progressives for nothing - he might even get that rumored Attorney General spot he’s being reportedly considered for in a Democratic Joe Biden administration. And perhaps de Blasio - despite never polling above 0.1 percent during the 2020 primaries - actually thinks he has a shot at the governor role. Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, as the saying goes. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"12 Oct, 2020",What a turn-off: TV ratings for NBA Finals PLUMMET as social justice campaigning blamed as factor in fans tuning out,"The 2020 NBA Finals have seen an enormous drop in ratings compared with last year, and the league’s vocal support of social justice issues has been suggested as one of the factors behind it. According toTV Line, Sunday’s NBA Final decider between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat – which the former won 106-93 to take the series 4-2 – drew in 5.5 million viewers, but last year’s final game between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors had an audience of18.9 million, signifying a 71 percent decrease in viewership. Game 5 drew in5.7 millionviewers, down almost 70 percent from the18.2 millionwho tuned in to watch the same game last year. There have been suggestions throughout the playoffs that the enormous gulf in viewership compared to last year has partly been due to the NBA’s increasingly vocal response to social justice issues this season. The blacklivesmatter slogan has been displayed on the courts in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with murder. Players were also allowed to display blacklivesmatter and “Equality” messages on their jerseys. In August, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted a game against Orlando Magic after a black man named Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by Wisconsin police. Texas senator Ted Cruz tweeted that news of the NBA’s falling ratings was “not surprising.” He added:“Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals. #GoWokeGoBroke” Not surprising. Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals.#GoWokeGoBrokehttps://t.co/ygIp60EKHi NBA commissioner Adam Silverhas suggestedthe league won’t be as explicit with its social justice messaging next season. He said that while the NBA is“completely committed to standing for social justice and racial equality,”he predicts next year“there’ll be somewhat a return to normalcy, that those messages will largely be left to be delivered off the floor.” However, while the messaging has evidently been off-putting for a section of the NBA fanbase this season, the severe decline in ratings appears to have a number of factors behind it. Veteran NBA coach George Karl certainly had strong views, issuing an X-rated rant over the slump attacking US President Donald Trump. There is talk of bad NBA ratings on TV. There are lots of reasons for that. The Leagues messages on social injustices isn’t one of them. But, fuck Trump!!And now I feel better... PerKWWL.com, an NBA spokeswoman said that health and safety was the primary concern in organizing this year’s Finals, rather than optimizing them for TV ratings. The games have been played behind closed doors in the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida as a result of the pandemic, diminishing the product on display without fans in the stadiums. What’s more, the delay in the season caused by Covid-19 means the Finals have been played in direct competition with the NFL, which would not have been an issue had the season finished in June as normal. The NBA has not been the only sport to suffer such a decline, either. PerYahoo Finance, the audience for the NHL playoffs dropped by 25 percent – including a 61 percent drop for the Stanley Cup finals – overall, while MLB’s playoffs have suffered a 39 percent decline. The NFL’s early viewing figures show a 14 percent decrease in viewership. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"12 Oct, 2020","Who funds the riotous American left & why? The globalist billionaire class, which uses it to build corporate socialism","Why do giant corporations and billionaires fund blacklivesmatter and Antifa, both avowed socialist groups? And why do the leftists accept their aid? They both want a kind of socialism, but only one of them could get their way. is an author of 11 books, including the most recent,Thought Criminal.

He was Professor of Liberal Arts at NYU from 2008 through 2019. Follow him on Twitter@TheAntiPCProf If you’re at all familiar with thecorporateandbillionairefunding sources behind blacklivesmatter and Antifa and the socialistcommitmentsof thesegroupsand theirleaders, you’ve probably wondered why the ‘capitalist class’ would support a movement whose doctrine is apparently antithetical to their own interests. Aren’t these funders capitalists after all, and don’t capitalists naturally oppose socialism? And why do American leftists dance like marionettes attached to strings pulled by globalist billionaires? Don’t they understand that they’re actually serving the masters they claim to oppose? The answer is not so simple as the World Socialist Websitesuggests:“The aims of the blacklivesmatter movement are aligned with those of Wall Street and the US government.”Nor is the answer that blacklivesmatter /Antifa have merely ‘sold out’ to capitalists. Nor is the donor class making a mistake, or merely interested in racial equality. The answer is that the corporate and billionaire elites prefer a kind of socialism – namely, ‘corporate socialism’. And what is corporate socialism? Corporate socialism is not merely government bailouts for corporations. It is a two-tiered system of ‘actually-existing socialism’ on the ground, paralleled by a set of corporate monopolies on top. (‘Actually-existing socialism’ is a pejorative term used mostly by dissidents in socialist countries to refer to what life was really like under socialism, rather than in the perfidious books of Marx and his epigones.) Wealth for the few, ‘economic equality’ under reduced conditions for the many – corporate socialism is a form of neo-feudalism. InWall Street and FDR, historian Anthony C Sutton described corporate socialism, as developed in the 19thth century, and distinguished it from state socialism, as follows:“[The] robber baron schema is also, under different labels, the socialist plan. The difference between a corporate state monopoly and a socialist state monopoly is essentially only the identity of the group controlling the power structure. The essence of socialism is monopoly control by the state using hired planners and academic sponges. On the other hand, Rockefeller, Morgan, and their corporate friends aimed to acquire and control their monopoly and to maximize its profits through influence in the state political apparatus; this, while it still needs hired planners and academic sponges, is a discreet and far more subtle process than outright state ownership under socialism…We call this phenomenon of corporate legal monopoly – market control acquired by using political influence – by the name of corporate socialism.” What Sutton calls corporate socialism might otherwise be called ‘corporate-run socialism’ or ‘socialist capitalism’. For both state socialists and corporate socialists, the free market is the enemy. They both seek to eliminate it. The free market threatens the system of state control in the case of state socialism. In the case of corporate socialism, the free market represents an impediment to the unhampered accumulation of wealth. The corporate socialists do not mean to eliminate profit. Quite to the contrary, they mean to increase it and keep it all to themselves. To ensure and appreciate profits to the fullest, corporate socialists seek to eliminate competition and the free market. As Sutton wrote, for the 19th-century corporate socialists:“The only sure road to the acquisition of massive wealth was monopoly: drive out your competitors, reduce competition, eliminate laissez-faire, and above all get state protection for your industry through compliant politicians and government regulation.” The difference between state socialism and corporate-run socialism, then, is merely that a different set of monopolists are in control. Under state socialism, the monopoly is held by the state. Under corporate socialism, the monopolists are giant corporations. But both political economies are characterized by monopoly. And both systems use socialist-communist ideology – or the recent incarnations, ‘social justice’ or ‘woke’ ideology – to advance their agendas. For corporate socialists, corporate monopoly is the desired end and socialist ideology is among the means. Socialist ideology works to the benefit of corporate socialists because it demonizes competition and the free market in an effort to eliminate them. This explains why capitalist corporations likeAmazonand mega-wealthy capitalist donors likeGeorge SorosandTom Steyeractually fund organizations with explicitly socialist agendas, like blacklivesmatter , and whyGoogle,YouTube,Facebook,Twitter, and other internet giants apparentlyfavor leftistand even socialist over ‘rightwing’ content and users. We can see the corporate socialist plan in action with the Covid-19 lockdowns and the blacklivesmatter /Antifa riots. The draconian lockdown measures employed by Democratic governors and mayors and the destruction perpetrated by the rioters are doing the work that corporate socialists want done. Is it any wonder that corporate elites favor leftist politics? In addition to destabilizing the nation state, leftist politics are helping to destroy small businesses, thus eliminating competitors. As the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE)points out, the lockdowns and riots have combined to level a one-two punch that is knocking out millions of small businesses –“the backbone of the American economy”– all across America. FEE reported that“…7.5 million small businesses in America are at risk of closing their doors for good. A more recent survey showed that even with federal loans, close to half of all small business owners say they’ll have to shut down for good. The toll has already been severe. In New York alone, stay-at-home orders have forced the permanent closure of more than 100,000 small businesses.” Moreover, minority-ownedbusinessesare the most at-risk. Even New York Governor Andrew Cuomo agrees:“They are 90 percent of New York s businesses and they re facing the toughest challenges.” Meanwhile, as FEE also notes, there is no evidence that the lockdowns have done anything to slow the spread of the virus. Likewise, there is no evidence that blacklivesmatter has done anything to help black lives. If anything, the riotous and murderous campaign of blacklivesmatter and Antifa have proven that black lives do not matter to blacklivesmatter . In addition to murdering black people, the blacklivesmatter and Antifa protest riots have done enormous damage to black businesses and neighborhoods, and thus, to black lives. As small businesses have been crushed by the combination of draconian lockdowns and riotous lunacy, corporate giants like Amazon have thrived like never before. The two developments ‘just so happen’ to move us closer to corporate-run socialism. As BBC Newsnoted, at least three of the tech giants – Amazon, Apple, and Facebook – have appreciated massive gains during the lockdowns, gains which were no doubt abetted by riots that cost one to two billion in propertydamages. During the three months ending with June, Amazon’s“quarterly profit of $5.2bn (£4bn) was the biggest since the company s start in 1994 and came despite heavy spending on protective gear and other measures due to the virus.” Amazon’s sales rose by 40 percent in the three months ending in June. Asreportedby TechCrunch, Facebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram platforms saw a 15 percent rise in users, which brought revenues to a grand total of $17.74 billion in the first quarter. Facebook’s total users climbed to three billion internet users in March, or two-thirds of the world’s internet users, a record. Apple’s revenues soared during the same period, with quarterly earnings rising 11 percent year-on-year to $59.7 billion.“Walmart, the country s largest grocer, said profits rose four percent, to $3.99 billion,”during the first quarter of 2020, asreportedby the Washington Post. These same corporations are also major supporters of blacklivesmatter and affiliated groups. As CNETreported,“Google has committed $12 million, while both Facebook and Amazon are donating $10 million to various groups that fight against racial injustice. Apple is pledging a whopping $100 million for a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative that will ‘challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exist for communities of color, and particularly for the black community’ according to Apple CEO Tim Cook.” Is it just a coincidence that the number of small businesses have been nearly cut in half by the Covid-19 lockdowns and the blacklivesmatter /Antifa riots, while the corporate giants have consolidated their grip on the economy, as well as their power over individual expression on the internet and beyond? Or, do the lockdowns and the riots prove that corporate socialism is afoot? And is“woke capitalism”merely a concerted PR campaign for appeasing activists and black people in order to curry favor and avoid cancel culture? Or, does woke capitalism actually express globalist, corporate socialist interests? What would a politics that serves such interests look like? To benefit the globalist agenda of corporate socialists, those of monopolies or near monopolies, a political creed would likely promote the free movement of labor across national borders and thus would be internationalist rather than nationalist. The global corporate monopolies or would-be monopolies would likely benefit from the creation of utterly new identity types for new niche markets, and thus would welcome and encourage gender pluralism, transgenderism and other identity morphisms. The disruption of stable gender identity categories erodes and contributes to the dismantling of the family, or the last bastion of influence between the masses and corporate power. Ultimately, the global capitalist corporation would benefit from a singular globalized governmental monopoly with one set of laws, and thus would promote a borderless internationalism under a global government, preferably under their complete control, otherwise known as globalism. And the corporate socialists would benefit from the elimination of small businesses. How does this line up with contemporary leftism? It has the same objectives. Leftism encourages unfetteredimmigration. Itencouragesgender pluralism andtransgenderismandopenly callsfor the dissolution of thefamily. It seeks to destroy historical memory, inherited culture, Christianity, and the nation state. It aims at a one-world monopoly of government. And it despisessmall businessand free enterprise. Thus, leftist politics align perfectly with the globalist interests of monopolistic corporations. And corporate socialists are the beneficiaries of their ‘activism’.

"12 Oct, 2020","‘Taking advantage of fools’: Trump weighs in on Portland violence, implores city to ‘call in the Feds!’","US President Donald Trump mocked authorities and rioters in Portland calling them “fools” while sharing footage of the so-called “Day of Rage” in which alleged indigenous activists tore down statues of former presidents. The US president’s bombastic multi-tweet broadside began early Monday morning, after a night of violence once again reduced central Portland to something resembling a warzone. Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb “leadership” fools. This is Biden! Law & Order!https://t.co/w0yH3SqnrB “Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb “leadership” fools. This is Biden! Law & Order!”he tweeted. A 200-strong group of rioters, many of whom wore body armor, carried shields and brandished blunt weapons like clubs, bats and night sticks, tore down several statues including those of former presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln before shattering the entrance to the Oregon Historical Society. Trump described them as“animals,” “Biden fools,”and “Antifa radicals” in a series of tweets. These are Biden fools. ANTIFA RADICALS. Get them FBI, and get them now!https://t.co/RI9fH6sC1g Riots ripped through the city s downtown district late Sunday through the early hours of Monday, with agitators smashing storefronts and wreaking havoc on the beleaguered city which has witnessed non-stop protests and violence since May. Portland police declared a riot, but did not intervene until almost an hour after the first statue was torn down. Trump abrasively stated that local authorities were“fools”who were being taken advantage of, urging city and state leaders to call for federal agency support, despite the failure of federal authorities to quell the ongoing riots in the city during the summer. Taking advantage of fools. Law & Order! Portland, call in the Feds!https://t.co/rJl9IVxdMM Sunday night’s protest was billed as an“Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage”by organizers on social media, who called for“direct action.” Monday is the federally-observed Columbus Day holiday, though many states and cities now refer to it as“Indigenous Peoples Day”in opposition to the violence perpetrated by Christoper Colombus and his conquistadors who conquered the Americas. Organizersreportedlyrequested that local journalists and live streamers stay away from the event so as not to potentially incriminate those tearing down the statues with their coverage. They also reportedly threatened and even assaulted those who were caught filming, shining laser pointers in their eyes or dousing them in liquid. Trump signed off by calling on federal agencies to combat the violence witnessed in cities across the US over the summer since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. “The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!”hesaid.

"9 Oct, 2020",Yelp’s accusation-based racism warning on restaurants encourages mob thuggery in the name of social justice,"User-generated review directory Yelp has made it easier for cancel-culture enthusiasts to wreak havoc on businesses, rolling out a scarlet letter for companies “accused of racism” that practically cries out to be abused. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram “Review-bombing” has long been a tactic of social-media intimidation on review sites like Yelp – an angry mob (or a competitor) targets a restaurant’s page by claiming they’ve all found dead cockroaches or hair in their food, or insists a store-owner called them nasty names. To Yelp’s credit, it eventually caught on to this practice and began freezing pages experiencing an unusually high amount of traffic with a “Public Attention Alert” warning users some reviews are likely not based on actual customer experiences and preventing new ones from being added. But while the “Public Attention Alert” was an all-purpose freeze, serving to paralyze the pages of businesses both targeted by and accused of racist behavior and other scandals, Yelp has apparently decided that didn’t go far enough in separating the perpetrators from the victims. The new “Business Accused of Racist Behavior Alert” makes it clear that the owner of any page bearing the warning is guilty of the worst offense one can commit in 2020 – never mind the presumption of innocence. In ablog postannouncing the feature on Thursday, Yelp stated it will be including a link to a news article with every “racist behavior alert,” implying the site needs more than just a few upset customers to apply the scarlet letter (actually a scarlet exclamation point). But the credulousness of most mainstream media outlets with regard to racist incidents – despitecountlesshoaxesin recent years – means even the most spurious allegations will likely find a taker somewhere. Social media is full of gullible joiners, people who can be persuaded to flood a business’ Yelp page with hate (ironically in the name of combating hate) by nothing more than an out-of-context photo and an emotional story. Armed with that rise in review activity and a news article confirming the claim, Yelp is free to act as judge, jury and executioner, slapping their racist behavior alert on a business that is likely already struggling due to the pandemic economic shutdowns still strangling the US economy. Any right-thinking individual who was contemplating eating or shopping there will probably reconsider – after all, no one wants to give their money to a bunch of racists. To believe that this won’t be abused by not only amoral attention-seekers and race grifters but also by economic competitors is absurdly naive. With fewer consumer dollars than ever floating around, businesses may find the easiest way to boost their own customer base is to destroy someone else’s. When a large corporation like Home Depot or Goya is ‘unmasked’ as a supporter of President Donald Trump, for example, calls to boycott inevitably follow, and their competitors see a surge in business – a phenomenon experienced by small or regional establishments as well. The racist behavior label still freezes reviews, so vengeful Yelpers can’t slag off the business on the internet. However, while the wanton destruction of commercial establishments seen across the US during the riots of the past five months has simmered down, periodic outbreaks are still leaving businesses in tatters. While the targets may not be planned, it’s not unreasonable to imagine that an establishment tagged as racist on Yelp might be specifically preyed on during the next riot. The Wendy’s where an Atlanta cop shot Rayshard Brooks in the parking lot was burned to the ground by rioters in June, not long after the killing, apparently because employees had called police to remove the unconscious Brooks, who had passed out in his car in the drive-through lane. Even if the reported racist incident is wholly accurate, the ethics of consigning a business to commercial death for what might be the actions of a single employee, especially during a recession, are dubious. If a restaurant is forced to close following a racism scandal amplified by Yelp, it’s vanishingly unlikely everyone who loses their jobs is also a racist – many will no doubt be people of color. Some 450 businesses have had warnings placed on them since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis reanimated blacklivesmatter , and the number is only growing. With unemployment at record levels in the US, what restitution does Yelp offer those who lose their jobs because its labels scared customers away? Perhaps with 60 percent of temporary business closures on the platform due to Covid-19 recently found to be permanent, Yelp has decided protecting the reputations of the businesses that use their platform is no longer a growth industry. But if this social-justice bullying continues, proprietors may find it’s more worth their while to stay off Yelp altogether. Possibly positioning itself for just such an outcome, the platform has also partnered with “Open to All,” a group that charges $10 for window decals marking a business as a no-discrimination zone, to create a diversity-training package for small businesses that can’t afford to hire a real “diversity consultant” to personally lambaste them for their racial sins. Small businesses may be dying, but race-grifting is a bull market. Just as the smearing of lamb’s blood on one’s door during Passover was supposed to protect the ancient Israelites from having their first-born sons slaughtered by an angry God, these “Open to All” signs and the “Black-Owned Business” labels Yelp adopted in June as a search feature may function as a silent plea to be spared during the next riot. But the bat-wielding sociopaths destroying property under cover of blacklivesmatter don’t actually care about black lives or any other social justice cause. Yelp may be aligning itself with the mob, but do businesses really think that rioters will heed their trendy talismans? Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"7 Oct, 2020",Michelle Obama’s Orwellian damage control for blacklivesmatter is a cynical attempt to gaslight the American people into voting for Biden,"The former First Lady has posted an ‘earnest’ piece to camera voicing her support for Joe Biden and, in an incredible bit of doublespeak, chastises those who hate riots and destruction as racist. is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC One of my favorite memes on the Internet is the “This is Fine” dog. It comes from acomic strip from back in 2015called “On Fire.” It depicts a dog sitting in the midst of his own home as it is engulfed in flames. He shows complete apathy for the situation all the way up until the point where he melts away due to the flames. Often you see this used as a reaction image on the internet to echo exactly that kind of apathy or trying to downplay a horrendous situation. Recently, the former first lady Michelle Obama seemed to do her best impression of this dog while implying that if you criticize blacklivesmatter for any of the riots that have gone on, you are a racist. The video, which is meant to boost Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, is chock full of Michelle Obama s trademark finger wagging. Her tone towards critics of blacklivesmatter and members of the Trump administration is like that of a woman scolding a dog for peeing on the rug. She attempts to paint the shock and horror of some of the greatest cities in America being lit on fire as being a cynical ploy to stoke fears about non-white people. So, let me get this straight, you’re telling me that what’s going on is mostly peaceful? Do I want to know what your definition of violence is? Let’s break down the problems here. The first is her statement that these protesters are mostly peaceful. Even if that was true, the simple fact that there have been riots in several major cities in the United States that have caused catastrophic damage to the property of American citizens, should be a cause for concern. This reeks of someone trying to make partisan excuses. What makes it even worse is that her statement is a blatant lie. The Princeton University group studied three months of these ‘demonstrations’ and anyone who can read a map can see the number of places that have had riots. Princeton University group studies 3 months of blacklivesmatter protests. Intent is to show they are overwhelmingly peaceful. But report reveals nearly 570 violent demonstrations--riots--in nearly 220 locations spread all across country.https://t.co/it60GBbTZTpic.twitter.com/Ph8iECyHIf Secondly, she, predictably, pulls the race card. Though I’m not the biggest fan of calls for empathy, I do think one is needed here. Imagine being a business owner in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Imagine working almost every day to make your small business a success. Then one day, a bunch of bored white kids chanting blacklivesmatter come and destroy your shop. Personally, I’m of the opinion that the hypothetical shop owner wouldn’t be too pleased. Now imagine the former First Lady telling you that you’re a racist because you’re mad about it. Doesn’t exactly sit well, does it? As someone who is both entranced and terrified by George Orwell’s 1984, I know doublespeak when I hear it. Michelle Obama obscures the meaning of words like violence, peaceful, and protest. This is a deliberate tactic that both she and her husband have used several times in the past. It is a form of political gaslighting, intending to make the person listening question their own sanity and what they already know to be true. It is one of the dirtiest tactics that you can pull in politics, and it’s something that we shouldn’t desire to be the norm. Here are the facts. Ever since the beginning of September,support for blacklivesmatter has been tanking. More and more people are getting wise to the game. All someone has to do is point at Joe Biden and his lack of condemnation for so long to see exactly what the Democrats’ policy prescription (or lack thereof) will be in the future. Trotting out Michelle Obama like a disappointed aunt and having her state blatant lies and half-truths is not going to turn America towards Joe Biden. If the Obamas of the world are to disappear from politics, I pray that it’s sooner rather than later. We don’t need any more reflections of an Orwellian nightmare while our cities burn.

"2 Oct, 2020","Covid’s last stand? With Trump laid low by coronavirus, expect a ‘miracle cure’ before November 3","Early Friday, President Donald Trump announced that he and the first lady had tested positive for Covid-19, throwing the nation into even deeper uncertainty just weeks before elections. So what can the American people expect now? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Oh what a difference a day makes, especially when we are talking about one of the most riotous 365-day periods in modern history, otherwise known as the year 2020. Just 30 days before the epic showdown between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the embattled incumbent threw a monkey wrench into the works by announcing he has Covid. And Twitter wept. Well, not entirely. As the ailing president was greeted with a tsunami of digital prayers from his electronic army, to expect anything less than a self-righteous sermon from the left would be a bit like hoping for an ice cream stand in hell. One of the most thoughtful messages I found from the Democrats to The Donald in his hour of need advised him not to drinkbleachin an effort to cure himself. Enough said. But lest anyone think that the liberals have the market cornered on wickedness need only consult the comments from Republicans following the recent death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But I digress. The main question now is what next? What will be the political fallout from this stunning development, and which party stands to gain the upper hand? Already the Democrats are taking up battle stations behind the argument that says “Trump is a reckless fool for not donning a mask in public like Joe Biden, and although we wish him a speedy recovery – wink, wink – he really should have listened to the science.” The Democrats are unlikely to get much mileage out of that preachy position. Presently, many Americans, suffering lockdown fever from behind grungy muzzles, are watching helplessly as small businesses are imploding faster than Amazon canscoop upthe slack. This naturally leads to a question of no small gravity: what is to be gained from surviving a virus if families lack the means to put food on the table? Here the survival instinct takes over as more people assume the position that the risks of keeping the nation in lockdown mode far outweigh those posed by catching Covid. The state of Florida is case in point. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantissignedan executive order allowing restaurants and bars to immediately begin operating at 100 percent capacity. If that news wasn’t enough to render Democrats breathless, DeSantis added that Tampa Bay would be permitted to host the Super Bowl in February. Compare that with Democrat-run California, where tempers areflaringas a shelter-in-place order continues to decimate the state economy to the point where even Disney World is laying off employees. Nevertheless, Democrats will not miss a chance to chastise Trump for holding massive ‘super-spreader’ rallies across the country, while his sequestered opponent rarely leaves his basement to either press the flesh or meet the press, as it were. This prissy criticism probably has more to do with the Biden camp’s conspicuous failure to generate grassroots enthusiasm than any concern about protecting people from getting sick. While Trump is jamming stadiums across the country, with little concern for social distancing, Biden would be challenged to fill a Waffle House on a Sunday morning. Jill Biden s Car Parade a Total Flop Compared to Massive Trump Boat Paradeshttps://t.co/rpxwNQ0OZ0pic.twitter.com/kmLC5JRqEP If the Democrats truly cared about halting the spread of the coronavirus, why did they give blacklivesmatter and Antifa what amounted to a medical pass to hold protests from sea to shining sea? That is not cheap rhetoric. In June, just as the blacklivesmatter protests were in full swing, Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tweeted: “In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.” We should always evaluate the risks and benefits of efforts to control the virus. In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.https://t.co/s9DagyjQ1J Here is where the Democrat’s logic for enforcing lockdowns crumbles to dust against the rocks of reason. On the one hand they say it is absolutely imperative to keep businesses shuttered, churches closed, and Trump rallies out of town lest Covid run rampant. On the other, they condone protesters running amok through their cities like modern Vandals, social distancing be damned, delivering the final coup de grace to the very same businesses that were already on the brink of bankruptcy. This leads to a separate but connected question: why are the Democrats so willing to coddle criminals? Are they afraid of alienating their anti-police progressive wing, or do they wish to help inflict as much damage on the country as possible in an effort to destroy Trump’s chances of re-election? While much of the partisan debate will focus on the question ‘to mask or not to mask’ during a pandemic, there is one possible outcome that could make all debate about facial coverings and social distancing obsolete overnight. For weeks and months, Trump has promised to deliver some miracle vaccine that will allow the United States to finally return to some level of normalcy. Thus far that promise, dubbed ‘Operation Warp Speed’, has gone nowhere fast. Now imagine this. What if Donald and Melania allow themselves to become the medical subjects – the premier guinea pigs, if you will – of a ‘breakthrough’ treatment that many doctors insist cures Covid-19. Yes, I’m talking about hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Although there has been a tremendous amount of heated debate regarding its safety and effectiveness, this drug has been effective against a number of diseases, including malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Just last month, a team of doctorsreleaseda study that concluded “HCQ is consistently effective against Covid-19 when used early in the outpatient setting, it is overall effective against Covid-19, it has not produced worsening, it is safe.” This finding, however, clashes with that of the Food and Drug Administration, for example, which hascautionedagainst the use of HCQ “outside of a hospital setting.” I send my best wishes and prayers to President@realDonaldTrump&@FLOTUSfor quick recoveries from COVID-19.I encourage them to take hydroxychloroquine to assist with their recoveries, & I am confident that they will be resuming their normal routines in the very near future.pic.twitter.com/LFxIWwvjo5 Now in the event that the most powerful couple in the United States were to be ‘resurrected’ by HCQ, an inexpensive drug that would provide no massive profits to the pharmaceutical industry, Trump would score a major victory in one fell swoop, and just days before November 3. He and Melania would be the living, breathing proof that the Democrats have no excuse for keeping much of the nation under lock and key. Of course, the democraticparty would never go along with the plan, saying it is risky and reckless, but Trump would have the ‘miracle cure’ he needs to get at least one half of America back on its feet again, and him back in the White House for another four years. For those who doubt such a possible turn of events, keep in mind that this is the year 2020 when absolutely everything is possible. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"1 Oct, 2020",US political discourse is so toxic & divided that friends of 30 years no longer talk to me. The America I loved has gone forever,"The bitter divisions in America are turning neighbour against neighbour and tearing families apart, amid an atmosphere of indoctrination where freedom of thought and speech is outlawed. I fear we’re on the road to civil war.

Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi 2020 has been one hell of a year. It included getting Brexit done, Covid-19, big-tech tyranny featuring extreme censorship by Twitter, Google, Facebook and Amazon as well as the stealth implementation of a social credit framework by Silicon Valley oligarchs as they plunder the economy under the diversionary power grab by pay-to-play politicians implementing quasi-permanent unlawful lockdowns. I’m sorry to say that the USA will become a banana republic. In addition, the global economy is in the worst economic depression in history - one that will only deepen as unemployment rates skyrocket as we enter the last few months of 2020. I bet most folks wish they could put a bullet in the head of 2020 and move straight on into 2021, but there are three months left - 2020 is only 75% done. What else could go wrong? Well in the USA, we still have to deal with a presidential election and the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States - two things that the left are fighting tooth and nail to stop. Imagine a SCOTUS filled with qualified judges and not rapist drunken abusers RBG planked for a minute for multiple sets at AGE 86 and did tons of pushups. She was stronger in her mid 80’s than any M*GA f*ckstick bootlicker could ever dream of. Take that energy with you tonight and always into the voting booth, the polls, and online to donate. University of Alabama professor Sarah Parcak’s take on SCOTUS Justices, acceptable on Twitter Since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, US politics have not only become highly toxic, they have also become radioactive. The swamp’s resist-everything democraticparty , enabled by FBI bias and animus that was spun like a spider’s web by the feckless fake news media and echoed by Hollywood’s hypocritical perverts, madenumerous attempts to stage a coup d etat(carefully read the declassified letter below) of the democratically elected president. The CIA referred an investigation to the FBI that the Hillary Clinton campaign was colluding with Russia to impact the 2016 presidential election. The FBI lied to the FISA judges to spy on the Trump campaign, and no one was ever prosecuted. Why haveFISA judges Collyer, Mosman, Conway and Dearie,who signed off on those warrants, and were lied to by the FBI to illegally obtain those same warrants to spy on a political opposition party during a presidential election, done nothing? Why have these Judges remained silent?  Is the entire system a stitch-up? Now, the narrative has shifted at warp speed. It’s no longer about Russian collusion. The new narratives that matter are virtue signalling, identity politics, critical race theory, record hypocrisy and adual justice systemwheremurder,looting and arson are justified because those on the right are all Nazis and the radicalized left’s enforcers,ANTIFAand blacklivesmatter thugs, are only “peaceful protestors.” And nothing will interfere with this narrative. For example, the blacklivesmatter mob influenced the prosecutors by getting them to charge blacklivesmatter supporter Larynzo Johnson with “wanton endangerment” when he ran up to two police officers and shot them while rioting. Why was this blatant assassination rampage not prosecuted as attempted murder? Is the blacklivesmatter mob now dictating charging decisions? Johnson’s attempted murder of police officers has quickly disappeared as it interferes with the media mob’s narrative. The media have drummed these themes into the heads of the public and driven a wedge between family members, close friends and co-workers that has polarized America to the brink of civil war. Life has become so bad in the USA that many of my several decades-old friendships recently ended when they became unable to respect any individual opinion that differed from their own. That has happened to me. Friends for decades have been consumed by Trump Derangement Syndrome and are cancelling me. For societies to evolve and flourish, we all need to accept other people s viewpoints and continue open-minded, civil and respectful dialogue. In science, scientists always question everything; why shouldn t we question everything in life without personalizing and demonizing those you disagree with? It’s become impossible to have rational fact-based discussions with these inflexible ideological zealots. I just had a long conversation with Hudson, my friend s son. He is 18 years old and is a popular American football playing, honour-list senior attending a private school in California. Hudson graduates this spring, and he hopes to be accepted and attend a college where he will play football. There are around 2,000 students in his private high school. From our conversation, I gleaned that most of Hudson s teachers and the student population are very liberal and intolerant of anyone who has differing views. What I found most shocking was how Hudson’s teachers “teach”. Today s students are not educated; they are indoctrinated. By that, I mean “teachers” are only telling half-truths or half of the story, so any “conclusions” the students are allowed to reach on their own are based on inaccurate data. These teachers incorporate their bias into an indoctrination cocktail with a dash of critical race theory in order to get the students to conform to the teacher’s world view. Hudson explained how“the loudest students at school are liberal—I guess it s over 98%.” Regarding the comments Hudson reads on social media channels from his school friends, he says all are supportive of Joe Biden becoming the 46th president of the United States; none are supporting Trump. When I asked why, he responded,“Your life would be ruined, and you would not get into college.” On 3 November, Hudson will be voting in his first presidential election. He will be voting for Donald Trump. But he is too fearful to discuss politics at school with his peers.He is too afraid to discuss politics with anyone but his parents.Terrorizing students is repugnant and must be stopped. The intelligentsia has created a toxic environment of indoctrination where freedom of thought and speech is outlawed. The student “mob” will enforce the process of re-education, utilizing lies, propaganda, peer-pressure and fear of cancellation. No student or adult should be intimidated, bullied or harassed to the point of unwavering compliance. There is something systematically rotten in our educational system, and it needs to be purged of these radical ideologues. These are fascist tactics - USA-style. Some White colonizers ""adopted"" Black children. They ""civilized"" these ""savage"" children in the ""superior"" ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity.https://t.co/XBE9rRnoqq Was this racism censored by Twitter? No, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, gave Kendi $10 million That said, don t expect things to improve anytime soon; in fact, COVID-19 will be used as an excuse to reset the economy. What does that mean? The oligarchs in Wall Street and in Silicon Valley will manipulate this election result, so Kamala Harris will be the de facto 46th president of the United States. The Democrats have not been able to win at the ballot box, so a Joe Biden win will pack the Supreme Court with liberal judges, end the Electoral College, fully eliminate the filibuster, add states to the union ensuring the democraticparty will have a permanent majority in the Senate, and will see the police defunded. Capitalism, democracy, the rule of law, liberty, freedom and free speech will come to a screeching halt under a Harris/Biden presidency where Joe Biden is simply ‘table meat’, or a ‘wet-lettuce.’ In the 29 September debate, Biden refused to answer any questions or lay out, for the American people, “his” policy plans, such as which radical judges will Harris/Biden pick to sit on the Supreme Court, whether he will stack the Court with liberal judges, whether he intends to abolish the Electoral College, whether he will really provide free healthcare to all illegal immigrants. Doesn’t this sound like Kamala Harris’s platform, rather than his? The next two presidential debates will be cancelled by Biden’s handlers because democracy is dead, and he is an empty vessel for Harris’s far-left agenda that no one voted for. It’s the only way to subvert democratic process in this election. If this electoral process seems like it is rigged and conservatives are screwed, it’s because that is the reality and tribalism is the new normal. The polls are completely and totally wrong. The huge silent majority are afraid to admit they are voting for Trump, so he will likely win the general election. However, the left’s intention to install President Harris (an Obama proxy) by hook or by crook will not go away and will likely spark a second civil war that brings the U.S closer to tyranny.

"30 Sep, 2020",Biden inspires little hope for a more peaceful tomorrow in an America torn apart by riots while Trump fumbles on race,"Joe Biden talks tough when it comes to taking Donald Trump ""behind the gym,"" or standing up to ""Corn Pop"" in a scary dispute over pool rules, but he just couldn t show mettle on crime and riots in Tuesday s presidential debate. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. The Democrat presidential candidate sounded more like a man inhibited in what he can say by sensitive voting blocs than a guy to take seriously on restoring order and peace to the streets of America s big cities. President Trump sensed those weak points with the far left and cornered Biden in some uncomfortable spots, but the incumbent was knocked on his heels regarding issues of race and failed to expose disingenuous attacks. This year s wave of blacklivesmatter and Antifa riots was a key stumbling point for Biden, whose running mate has encouraged the unrest and who has failed to make any meaningful efforts to de-escalate the tensions. That s why it was so preposterous yesterday when British Labour Party MP Chris Bryant nominated Biden for a Nobel Peace Prize, saying he has been a""calming influence to bear""at a time when""American cities have been in flames."" Never mind the sickening thought of giving the prize to someone with a warmongering record as ugly as Biden s, which is bad enough. The notion that Biden has been a force for peace in America s fiery year of unrest is preposterous. Until about a month ago, when CNN host Don Lemon pointed out that Democrats could lose votes because of their failure to quell the riots, Biden seemed afraid to speak out against the violence. And as debate moderator Chris Wallace exposed on Tuesday, Biden has made no apparent effort to be part of the solution. When asked whether, as head of his party, he had called city and state leaders in Democrat-run Portland, Oregon to advise them on ending more than three months of violent protests, Biden said:""I don t hold public office now. I m a former vice president.""But earlier in the debate, when challenged by Trump on whether he would cave to pressure within his party to create a socialist health care system, Biden said:""The party is me. I am the democraticparty right now.""Wallace reiterated his question, and Biden said:""They can, in fact, take care of it if he (Trump) just stays out of the way."" Trump then faltered when Wallace asked him whether he would condemn white-supremacist and militia groups to help discourage violence. This was an opportunity to clearly condemn white supremacy but then point out that it s neither the cause of the riots or something Trump should have to answer for. Instead, he said:""Who would you like me to condemn? Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.""He added correctly:""Somebody s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem."" This is where Biden really stepped in it, interjecting:""Antifa s an idea, not an organization, his FBI director said."" ""You know what, he s wrong… Antifa is a dangerous, radical group. You ought to be careful of them. They ll overthrow you,""Trump responded. This was one of several points where Trump exposed Biden s weakness on law and order. In fact, he repeatedly pointed out that Biden couldn t even say the words""law and order""for fear of offending radical left-wing voters. An agitated Biden finally said:""Yes, I m for law and order with justice where people get treated fairly."" Asked about the Democrat talking point of""reimagining policing,""Biden spoke of police reforms, such as having psychologists joining officers in answering emergency calls, to help end systemic injustice. Trump interjected, saying:""That s not what they re talking about, Chris, he s talking about defunding police."" Biden denied the point, and Trump retorted by saying Biden has no endorsements from law enforcement organizations. When Biden again denied, Trump said:""Oh really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead, think. We have time.""Biden replied:""We don t have time to do anything except… folks, folks."" For any police groups that might have been on the fence, it was not an inspiring moment as the 77-year-old Biden foundered. Trump again exposed perhaps the biggest Achilles heel of Biden and other Democrats in the November election. Party members not only have failed to address the violence, some have encouraged it. Democrat cities have ordered police to stand down, then prosecuted citizens who are forced to defend themselves. As was obvious to CNN s Lemon, Americans are fed up with the riots. blacklivesmatter s approval ratings dropped nine percentage points between June and early September,according topolling by Politico-Morning Consult. Even in the blue state of Oregon, two-thirds of voterssaidthey disapprove of the protests that have plagued Portland. Not having a winning argument to make on the protests, Biden fell back to the leftist crutch, calling trump a""racist.""He did it again when Trump clumsily explained why he had banned the use of critical-race-theory training in federal agencies. Biden even said:""This guy and his friends look down their nose on so many people… They look down on people who don t have money, they look down on people who are of a different faith, they look down on people who are a different color."" Trump failed to make Biden pay for the cheap shots. He failed to offer clear examples of the absurdity and racist nature of critical-race-theory training. And he failed to turn the race ploy back around against his accuser,quoting a few ofBiden s egregiouslyracist comments, including the insulting statement that""you ain t black""if you have to even question whether you re voting for him. For good measure, Trump could have more clearly contrasted the policy moves he has made that actually helped black people with the harmful policies of the Democrats during Biden s 47 years as a party leader.

"30 Sep, 2020",Trump tells Proud Boys to ‘STAND BACK’ from ‘left-wing’ riots as Biden calls Antifa only ‘AN IDEA’,"President Donald Trump made hay on issues of law and order at Tuesday’s debate as Democratic challenger Joe Biden struggled to condemn this summer’s wave of riots when confronted with his lack of calls to end the violence. Asked by moderator Chris Wallace whether, as leader of his party, he had called Oregon’s Democrat governor or Portland’s Democrat mayor to advise them on ending more than three months of violent protests, Biden said,“I don’t hold public office now. I’m a former vice president. I made it clear that violence should be prosecuted.” Wallace pointed out that earlier in the debate, Biden had said“I am the democraticparty right now,”and asked him again whether he had called leaders in Democrat-run Portland to offer guidance. “They can, in fact, take care of it if he [Trump] just stays out of the way,”Biden said. Wallace then turned to Trump, asking if he would condemn white-supremacist and militia groups to help discourage violence. “Who would you like me to condemn? Proud Boys? Stand back and stand by,""Trump replied. ""But I’ll tell you what. Somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem.” Biden interjected, saying“Antifa’s an idea, not an organization.

Trump has clashed with city and state leaders in Democrat-run areas as they resisted his efforts to send more federal forces to help quell the violence. While accusing Trump of inciting the unrest, Democratic politicians, including Biden s running mate Kamala Harris, have encouraged the racial protests. It wasn t until after the Democratic convention that Biden and other Democrat leaders first spoke out against the violence. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"30 Sep, 2020","Biden distances himself from ‘far-left’ voters, rejects ‘crucial’ Green New Deal & defund the police movement","Accused by Donald Trump multiple times of being controlled by a “socialist” party and the “far-left,” Joe Biden tried moving to the middle by rejecting the Green New Deal and the defund the police movement. Biden confused many with his comments on not supporting the Green New Deal, as he has spoken positively of the environmentalist plan put forward by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-New York) in the past. Debating the topic of the environment, Trump defended rolling back EPA regulations put in place by the Obama administration and claimed Biden would hurt the economy with initiatives like the Green New Deal (which is estimated to cost trillions). “The Green New Deal is not my plan,”Biden declared, saying he supports his own plan. Moments later, however, the former vice president said“the Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.” “Do you support the Green New Deal?”moderator Chris Wallace asked. “No, I do not support the Green New Deal,”Biden clarified, likely previously referring to his“Biden plan,”but misspeaking. Does Joe Biden know what he s talking about?Joe Biden: ""The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward...""*seconds later*Chris Wallace: ""Do you support the Green New Deal?""Joe Biden: ""No, I don t support the Green New Deal.""pic.twitter.com/ampOmwPGTo Biden said he doesn’t support the Green New Deal. That’s actually a huge development. Or did he misspeak?#Debates2020https://t.co/NXqzJYj2XM Biden: I don’t support the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal will pay for itself, I don’t support the Green New Deal. What has also led to confusion is the fact that Biden has been supportive of the Green New Deal in the past, even calling it a“crucial framework”when releasing his own environmental plan. His running mate, Kamala Harris, was also a co-sponsor on the Green New Deal. Joe Biden said tonight he does not support the Green New Deal, appearing to directly contradict his campaign website. Kamala Harris also supports the Green New Deal.pic.twitter.com/ns0nRnOfAI Wallace: Do you support the Green New Deal? Biden: No, I don’t. Ocasio-Cortez leads the Biden task force. Also:https://t.co/y6LL4OuaXE Ocasio-Cortez jumped into the debate and re-solidified her support for Biden by claiming her“differences”with Biden are why she joined his“Climate Unity Task Force.” This isn’t news, Kellyanne.Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so we could set aside our differences & figure out an aggressive climate plan to address the planetary crisis at our feet.Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.https://t.co/Bj8SMD9Syf Biden also rejected the defund the police movement, which has become a popular rallying cry with many Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez. Told by Trump that he does not have the support of law enforcement and would defund police departments, Biden bit back by accusing Trump of being the one looking to defund police. “I’m totally opposed to defunding the police officers,”Biden shot back.“They need more assistance.” “Local police. The only one defunding, in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance,”he added. Biden has, however, expressed support for diverting funds for law enforcement agencies to other areas. REMINDER: During a “Now This” interview, Joe Biden said he wants to defund the police. Here’s the exchange⬇️ Ady Barkan: “Can we agree that we can redirect some of the funding [from the police]?” Joe Biden: “Yes, absolutely”pic.twitter.com/m9iLxssYih Some accused Biden of not supporting the blacklivesmatter movement based on his blasting Trump for being the one“defunding”police. I hate Biden s framing that the only one who supports defunding the police is Trump, and that actually Biden supports increasing their budget. Like spitting in the eye of the blacklivesmatter movement. Trump: Joe, will u defund the police 😎🤔Biden: No I will not in fact I will give them more moneyMe and the rest of black America:pic.twitter.com/iFhKQBOqC2 Biden was also criticized by blacklivesmatter supporters for not expressing explicit support for the movement. WHY DID BIDEN COMPLETELY AVOID THE blacklivesmatter QUESTION? ""do you support the blacklivesmatter movement?"" ""well i uh-"" Is Chris gonna ask Biden whether he’s gonna answer the blacklivesmatter question? ... evidently not. Joe Biden could not say he supported blacklivesmatter .

"29 Sep, 2020","‘Yo ass goin’ viral’: Antifa, blacklivesmatter protesters surround Portland police car, play victim when officer draws weapon","Hordes of activists took to the streets of Portland once again Monday night. When one group surrounded a cop car, the officer inside drew his service weapon, prompting wild complaints from the assembled crowd. Monday’s demonstrations marked four consecutive months of protests as a group of roughly 150 protesters gathered to once again protest police brutality, systemic racism and a number of other grievances. A crowd was filmed approaching a police vehicle and interrogating the officer inside, who referred them to theincidentin which two LA police officers were shot while sitting in their patrol car. I wasn t going to post this, but the streamer is still going off about it and the Seattle blacklivesmatter freaks are trying to make this a thing. They are claiming a cop pulled a gun out on them and aimed it at them. He was in his car with unstable folks approaching him. Completely justifed.pic.twitter.com/mADbaw34Yj The protesters ran into the same officer later in the evening and vowed that he was going to“go viral”and that a number of lawyers and police watchdog organizations would be investigating why he had his weapon drawn when they approached him initially. Here’s the blacklivesmatter activist lying about how the police officer he approached to threaten had “pulled a gun” on him for “no reason.”pic.twitter.com/MjRlnepeQK Elsewhere in the city, Portland Police swept through North Portland park to pre-emptively clear out any contraband and weapons before the protests had even begun. Heavily-armed policeconfiscatedhomemade shields and other paraphernalia during the operation,""To lower the likelihood that members of the gathering would use the shields to protect those intent on committing crimes such as throwing objects at police,”the Portland Police Bureau said. A Portland Police Sergeant was hospitalized and at least five other officers were injured when they were sprayed with a chemical irritant while trying to break up an“unlawful assembly”in the Kenton neighborhood of the city. Police claim they found a loaded handgun inside a vehicle purporting to be an amateur medical transport for the protesters. Driver, Jason Dye, 40, of Portland was issued multiple citations for driving offences and an investigation into the handgun has been launched. Protesters wearing heavy body armour marked with ""press"" insignia and carrying ""press"" passes were arrested while in possession of knives and pepper spray. Earlier on Monday, local authorities announced that dozens of Portland police officers who were deputized to make federal arrests will retain their powers until the end of 2020. Some 56 officers, sergeants and lieutenants from the Portland Police bureau’s rapid response team, will retain additional authority to help quell the ongoing violence in the city which has marred the protests. Their deputization does not automatically result in federal charges should they be assaulted  by violent protesters. However, several protesters are already facing federal prosecution for assaulting local Portland police officers throughout the wave of protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May.

"28 Sep, 2020","A tale of two crumbling cities. So, who’s the world’s worst mayor: New York’s de Blasio or London’s Khan? It’s a close-run race...","It’s my misfortune to have homes in two of the worst-run cities in the world. They’re both blighted by violent crime, poverty, drug-taking, & homelessness. What they also have in common is incompetent woke socialists as leaders. Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi I was born in Manhattan and lived through the many riots and rampant crime waves that swept through New York City decades ago. I have spent much of my adult life living in London and watched the rapid deterioration of the quality of life under the reigns of successive mayors. Why do modern voters on both sides of the pond accept these virtue-signaling liars who claim to push social justice as an enhancement to their patronizingly faux “woke” credentials? Many generations have passed down a stark truth: all politicians lie. Well, why would anyone vote for any politician or party that continuously fails to protect or improve the lives of their constituents, repeatedly tells untruths, and shifts blame and refuses to accept responsibility for their failure? Because, like the UK prime minister, they grunt sexy three-word soundbites the majority want to hear, such as “Get Brexit done”, and “Hire more police”? The problem is power. Politicians can never have enough power, making it far too easy for them to abuse the trust granted them by the people to act on behalf of the people. The most egregious examples of this are New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and UK PM Johnson. Bill de Blasio (born Warren Wilhelm Jr.) is a staunch uber-liberal democraticparty operative who has been the mayor of New York since 2014. He championed the call to “defund the police” during his dismal bid to become the 2020 Democratic nominee for president, running on a platform of “Orange Man bad” before dropping out after regularly polling at 0 percent among Democratic primary voters, including in his home state. I’ve just spent two weeks in Manhattan and I can officially declare that de Blasio has successfully converted the city into “Wokeistan”: a bankrupt, crime-infested, lawless, virtually uninhabitable hotbed of pay-to-play politics. De Blasio has supported thelegalizationof recreational marijuana in NYC, while denying rumors he himself smoked some at his official Gracie Mansion residence, located on Manhattan’s fancy Upper East Side. As Covid swept the city, de Blasio was virtue signaling his woke credentials, helpingpainta vast blacklivesmatter slogan on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower. Violent crime rates  – specifically murder, arson, and looting – have rocketed to levels not seen since the 1970s. During the peak of this crime wave, de Blasio cut the NYPD’s budget by $1 billion, depriving the neediest low-income neighborhoods of desperately needed extra policing. How’s that worked out? Well, New York City shootings were up 166 percent in August this year compared to August 2019. De Blasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, NYC’s First Lady, enjoys a staff of 14, at a cost of $2 million to taxpayers. In 2015, de Blasio placed McCray at the helm of the city’s $1.25 billion mental health initiative known as ThriveNYC. ThriveNYC missed its financialtargetsduring the worst mental health crisis and a Covid pandemic in its fiscal year ending July 2020. Homelessness is at epidemic levels in New York – you can’t walk a block without coming across several people sprawled on the sidewalk, often having passed out from drug-taking. De Blasio’s incompetence stretches far and wide. Last week, he announced he had missed NYC’s budget targets and would befurloughing9,000 employees, and possibly laying off 20,000. Will his wife, along with her 14 staff, be first in line? I somehow doubt it. This week, there were calls for him to be relieved of control over New York City’s Department of Education. Once again, at the last minute and while disregarding the welfare of all children, he canceled plans to reopenschools– a move that was blatantly political and all about hurting Trump’s re-election prospects. So, how does that long and ropey track record compare with that of the leader of that other capital of Woke, London? Sadiq Khan, a soft-left member of the Labour Party, was elected mayor in 2016. In 2017, on his watch, there were five terror-related attacks in the British capital, which left 14 dead and 136 injured. The worst of these, in terms of loss of life, was theatrocitythat took place at Borough Market and on London Bridge. Responding to a question regarding the likelihood of future terror attacks in major metropolitan centers, Khan stated there was “no reason to be alarmed” and that “terror attacks are now part and parcel of living in a big city.” The murder rate hit a decade-long high in 2019 under Khan’s reign of wokeness. In November that year, a convicted radical Islamist terrorist named Usman Khan (aka Abu Saif), released from prison after serving only half of his 16-year sentence, murdered two and injured three before police shot him dead. Sadiq Khancommented, “I’m the mayor of the greatest city in the world, and one of our strengths is our diversity.” He might be the mayor, but he’s been way behind the curve during the Covid-19 crisis. His crazy ultra-low-emission and congestion-chargingschemeshave helped kill the restaurant and retail trade in central London. Sorry, Mr Mayor – that’s not how a political leader helps businesses recover during the most severe economic depression in the capital’s history. Suspend the charges until the pandemic ends and the economy recovers! In both New York and London, ideological extremists on the left are pushing socialist agendas. In NYC, that includes defunding the police, decriminalizing and legalizing “quality of life” crimes, and setting policies of no-cash bail. This allows for a revolving door in the court process, which a senior New York City counterterrorism officer describer to me this way: “By the time I’ve finished all my arrest reports and the accompanying paperwork, it’s likely that the thugs I arrested are already back out on the street committing the same crimes that these thugs were arrested for only hours earlier.” The system is systemically rotten to its core and has people such as George Soros contributing massive amounts of money to elect radical district attorneys and prosecutors who do not prosecute. In London, the showman ex-mayor of London turned PM, Boris Johnson, campaigned on a totally disingenuous promise of adding 20,000 police. In fact, even if achieved, that would still not get numbers back to what they were before his partyslashedthem. This is all reminiscent of the crazy lack of enforcement that resulted in the lawlessness of the 1960s and early 1970s – and why knowing your history is essential. As we learnt from those decades, severe crimes require severe laws and severe punishments. We need honest politicians who not only understand these principles, but also make it a priority to protect the people they serve instead of protecting their slave masters, the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, whose boots the politicians and fake-news media pundits lick in return for power and fat stacks of cash.

"28 Sep, 2020","Whoever wins in November, here’s six reasons why America is on the brink of a complete political and social breakdown","The toxic US political culture will be laid bare in tomorrow’s opening TV debate between Trump & Biden. It’s so bad that whichever man wins the election, there’s likely to be further violence, especially if the result is close. ByGraham Hryce, an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. America is facing unprecedented political and social crises, no matter who wins November’s presidential election. The broad outline of these looming problems is already apparent and they have their roots in the toxic political culture that has developed in the country over the past 30 years. The six key indicia of the impending crises are as follows: Donald Trump’s failure to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The recent intensification of the race problem that has bedevilled American politics since the eighteenth century. The rioting and social breakdown recently engendered by the blacklivesmatter movement and other groups. The recent intensification of the culture wars that have plagued American society since the 1960s. The emergence of a so-called “radical leftist” group within the democraticparty , led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and tolerated by Joe Biden. Trump’s recent politicising of the Supreme Court and the abortion issue by nominating an appointee with strong anti-abortion views, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to replace Justice Ginsberg. These recent developments have led to a dramatic deepening of divisions within American society that will only intensify after the November election, whatever the outcome. First, the anti-Trump forces within the republicanparty will turn on Trump and his supporters, and the party will go through a period of blood-letting and political infighting. Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016 because he was the only nominee with any chance of beating Hillary Clinton. Many Republicans despise Trump and only support him because he won in 2016 and can win again. Mitt Romney is typical of this group. He hates Trump (he voted to impeach him) but has recently given him crucial support on the Supreme Court nomination issue in order to ensure a Republican victory in November. Recent criticism of Trump by George W Bush and other former Republican figures confirm the depth of anti-Trump feeling within the party. So, too, does the recent endorsement of Biden by former Republican senator John McCain’s widow. They are not running for office, so they can say what they think. Hard-core Trump supporters, of course, will never accept a Biden victory and they will take to the streets to protest. And does anyone seriously believe that Biden (or Kamala Harris) is capable of doing anything to heal the deep-seated divisions destroying American society? A Biden victory will see the Ocasio-Cortez faction within the democraticparty become more powerful, which can only make these problems even more intractable. The democraticparty is likely to fracture altogether. The Ocasio-Cortez faction will either attempt to take over the party or split from it. In either case, this will be a disaster for the Democrats, because they need support from both the Ocasio-Cortez and Biden voter bases to win elections. Amidst the chaos, conservative Democrats are likely to drift back to the republicanparty (as they did in 1968 and during the Reagan years). As for the Republicans, it will be four more years of rule by a now emboldened and more powerful Trump. That is hardly a recipe for social stability. Trump has done nothing to heal America’s wounds in the last four years, and nothing will change during his second term. In fact, he is likely to deal with his opponents more forcefully than before. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters, of course, will never accept a Trump victory and will intensify their campaign of destabilisation, using and encouraging movements like blacklivesmatter and Antifa. And if the Supreme Court (with Justice Barrett now on the bench) rules that abortion is illegal (thereby overturning its 1973 decision in Roe v Wade), this will, by itself, provoke widespread protests and riots which will rival the blacklivesmatter protests in intensity. There is a third (and more likely) scenario, however, and it portends an even graver crisis. Assume that the result of the election will not be clear in November; that Trump will challenge the legitimacy of the election and try to hold on to power; and that Justice Barrett has been appointed to the Supreme Court. These are all perfectly reasonable assumptions. We know that the election will probably be close, and that postal votes won’t be counted for some time. Trump has consistently said that an election permitting widespread postal voting is not legitimate, and has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power. And his nominee to the court is likely to be confirmed before the election. If this scenario occurs, America would be plunged into a protracted political crisis that could drag on for months – similar to the Nixon Watergate crisis of 1974, but with important differences. Unlike Nixon, Trump has not engaged in transparent corruption, so his position would be much more secure. Nixon was clearly corrupt, and his refusal to hand over the Watergate tapes, and his sacking of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and the resignation of Attorney-General Elliot Richardson, sealed his fate. The Supreme Court unanimously ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes, and a substantial number of principled Republican politicians made it clear to him that they would vote in favour of his impeachment. Nixon then had no alternative but to resign. Would a significant number of Republican politicians desert Trump in the circumstances outlined above? Probably not. After all, they have supported him for the last four years. It is interesting, however, that last week Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did commit the republicanparty to an orderly handover of power – while Trump again refused to do so. One thing is certain – Trump will never resign. The Supreme Court would inevitably become involved in such a crisis – the very Supreme Court that the Democrats accuse him of improperly stacking with conservative appointees, including the newly appointed Justice Barrett. Would the Supreme Court support Trump? Recent anti-Trump decisions of the court (which Trump foolishly condemned), Chief Justice Roberts’ emotional eulogy for Justice Ginsberg last week, and the court’s fundamental need (in such a crisis) to reassert its own independence and integrity, suggest that it probably would not. Trump, being Trump, no doubt thinks that any judge he appointed would automatically support him – but that is to completely misunderstand how the Supreme Court operates. The history of the Court is replete with conservative appointees who later asserted their judicial independence. But whatever way the Supreme Court ruled, there would be a very substantial portion of the American populace that would simply refuse to accept its decision, unlike in 1974. A political crisis of the kind outlined above would inevitably result in further social disintegration and more mass violence and lawlessness on the streets of America – fuelled by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The riots and killings that have occurred in Portland, Louisville and other cities across America in recent months make this clear. If this has occurred pre-election, it is frightening to imagine what will happen during a protracted post-election political crisis. Whatever happens in November, America’s future is bleak. Because they are both embedded in America’s toxic political culture, neither Trump nor Biden (or Harris) have the capacity to deal with the looming political and social crises. And, even if the Supreme Court and the conservative wing of the republicanparty intervene to resolve any immediate political crisis, they would be powerless to contain the broader social crisis it will engender. We could well be witnessing the initial stages of the complete unravelling of America. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"27 Sep, 2020","California Catholic cathedral vandalized with blacklivesmatter , swastikas and ‘Biden 2020’ graffiti","Vandals have attacked a Catholic cathedral in California, defacing it with swastikas, pentagrams and a range of political slogans including “Biden 2020” and “ blacklivesmatter .” St. Peter’s Chaldean Catholic Cathedral in El Cajon, California said in a statement on Facebook that it had fallen victim to a graffiti attack. Video footage posted by the cathedral showed numerous symbols and slogans spray-painted on the building. Nazi slogans including swastikas and“White Power""could be seen alongside upside down crosses,“ blacklivesmatter ,”and“Biden 2020.”Some of the graffiti was indecipherable, while some of the slogans represented opposed ideologies, raising question marks about the motivation for the attack. In a magnanimous message, the church urged its congregation to pray for the perpetrators of the defilement as well as for Christians in Iraq.“This morning our beloved Cathedral was defaced with pentagrams, upside down crosses, white power, swastikas, blacklivesmatter , etc. It reminds us to pray for my brethren in Iraq that are facing persecution. Pray for the criminals who did this,”it said. The incident is the latest in a string of attacks at Catholic churches in the United States in recent months. Earlier this week, a church in Florida fell victim to an arson attack, while in Texas, a man armed with a baseball bat damaged icons at a seminary. The Chaldean Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Church headquartered in Baghdad. Its following has grown in the US in recent decades amid an influx of immigrants from the Middle East.

"27 Sep, 2020","Time for some NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism Research: Forget activism, here comes ‘artivism’ in support of blacklivesmatter ’s aims","A new art exhibition opening in the UK this week is packed with so much neo-Marxist nonsense, I thought at first it must be a parody. Sadly, it’s not. But it is moralising, boring, and – you guessed it – taxpayer funded. is an artist, art critic and author. Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist is an artist, art critic and author. Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist You could be forgiven for thinking an exhibition opening in Coventry this week was a spoof, a satirical piece of work by some comedian gently taking the mickey out of today’s increasingly woke art world. More s the pity, it isn’t. Advance press releases for‘Thirteen Ways of Looking’ (opening on October 2) promise art by 13 artists, all discussed on the bases of identity and politics, as is expected in a British tax-funded public venue in 2020. Organisers at Herbert Art Gallery & Museum discuss the race, migration status and family origins of the artists involved, but neglect to describe their artistic achievements or the objects to be displayed. Topics to be covered include the marital disappointment of Pakistani women, the experience of a female Chinese migrant, and“Black female subjectivities within narratives of the future.”As a response to blacklivesmatter , the collective Hyphen-Labs is showing a virtual-reality piece about“Black women as neuroscientists using the domain of the beauty salon as a rebel underground network for a radically new shared system of communication.”What? Visitors can view the art of Keith Piper (which castigates the supposed indifference of white Britons regarding an arson attack in London in 1981), and Eddie Chambers’ exploration of nationalism and fascism. His image fusing the British Union Flag and a swastika is a promotional image. Shama Khanna“will write a critical research piece”about an art-sharing website. Herbert Art Gallery’s race-based programming surfaces again in its hosting of adiscussionof“NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism Research.” This exhibition is linked to next year’s Coventry City of Culture events and the 2021 Coventry Biennial; organisersadmit,“we [Coventry Biennial] are an activist organisation.”‘Thirteen Ways of Seeing’ is“artivism”– the exploitation of art funding, venues and status by Neo-Marxist social-justice activists. This is facilitated by venues which need to meet race/sex/sexuality/immigrant quotas. Now that postmodernism has dismantled common standards of art criticism, neither artists nor administrators need to bother about disguising propaganda as art. Potential smears of racism, homophobia and xenophobia silence visitors and critics. The exhibitionlays clear funding connections between activists; it is supported by local universities, which promote post-modernism in their art courses. Another partner is the Contemporary Visual Arts Network, an activist organisation which has inits mission statementthe following aim:“Instigate systemic change within the sector addressing inequalities by dismantling institutional ingrained negative attitudes to class, race and sexuality.”The gallery is supported by Arts Council England, which distributes public money to organisations. Ridiculous as much of contemporary art is, rather than mocking or criticising creators – who are following incentives and are as much exploited as they are exploiting – we should be examining the network of creators, curators, administrators, charity leaders and college tutors. A reliance on public funding and money donated by charities and corporations means that artists can detach themselves from responding to public demand. These artists do not have to appeal to purchasers, patrons or public; instead, they thrive in a political-art ecosystem funded by taxpayers and ‘woke’ corporations, detached from public praise and criticism. Without such a network, this grievance art would fade away due to lack of attention. Art that is chosen for political reasons is rarely of high quality. Art motivated by anger or self-pity is generally weak as art. Although I have not seen the material to be exhibited in Coventry (beyond a few images), indications suggest this exhibition will be no different to dozens I have seen. Far from“disrupting the visual arts,”‘Thirteen Ways of Looking’ is the epitome of insider-approved art promoted by the state. It is pure elitism. My personal view is that artists should be free to make the art they want – including art that is distasteful, ill-informed and foolish. However, whether or not a nation is wise to fund (and thereby encourage) such art is another matter. Bad and stupid art should not be suppressed; it should be laughed at, or ignored. The fact that taxes fund exhibitions like this is no laughing matter. We should pause to consider the talented artists (of all races) who are not exhibited in public galleries because they make beautiful art that is apolitical. Thevenue declares:“From 18 September, it will be legally required for museum staff to collect NHS Test and Trace data from visitors, and keep this for 21 days. Any visitors unwilling to provide this information will not be permitted entry into the museum.”If you visit this exhibition, you will have your personal data recorded by the government. So there’s a second reason why I shan’t be going. Perhaps even enthusiasts of grievance art and NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism will find this Big Brotherism unacceptable too.

"27 Sep, 2020","Candace Owens’ first book takes a sledgehammer to Democrats, blacklivesmatter , abortionists & George Floyd – but will it achieve its goal?","Blackout is a liberal sacred cow abattoir that slaughters its way through left-wing arguments about everything from police brutality to education and family values. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Candace Owens, the conservative political commentator and social media sensation, has released her first book, and it could not be timelier. The book is not subtle, as its subtitle,“how black America can make its second escape from the Democrat plantation,”suggests.  It is more of a sledgehammer than a stiletto in the way it deals with Democratic arguments and their framing of American history. The tome is unapologetically partisan in favour of the republicanparty and particularly President Trump; however, even if you do not agree with Owens’ conclusion that America’s only option is four more years of The Donald, her analysis of the facts is very difficult to dispute. Many of the arguments will be familiar to people who have followed Owens’ rise online over the past few years (she has 2.6 million Twitterfollowers), but the book allows her to probe more deeply into the issues she often addresses in her viral videos. The main thrust of her thesis is that the democraticparty has completely failed the black community on virtually every level. She argues that the party of slavery, the Confederacy and the Klan has never been an ally of black America but has merely shifted from viewing them purely as chattels to viewing them purely as votes. This argument is provocative and, in the words of fictional figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels, will get the people going. The book is mostly a political analysis, but Owens makes clear how her own life experiences have shaped her worldview.‘Blackout’is peppered throughout with references to her upbringing in Stamford, Connecticut, and specifically the influence of her grandfather. He began life as a sharecropper in North Carolina, laying out tobacco to dry out from the age of five. She recounts occasions when, in his youth, their farm was attacked by Klansmen; how his father’s drinking and philandering made him move north where he met her grandmother. Owens lived with her grandparents for a while when she was young, a time she looks back on with great fondness, and it seems to be where the bedrock of her conservative worldview was formed. Owens lays out the problems she believes are facing the black community, and how she views the Democrats as responsible. In the chapter ‘On Family’ she details how the destruction of the black family unit and rise in single motherhood has been aided and abetted by welfare programs devised by Democrats from FDR to LBJ and, more recently, Clinton and Obama. She also takes aim at Planned Parenthood, which she claims has been conducting a“black genocide”by administering abortions, pointing out that despite only accounting for 13 percent of the population, 40 percent of abortions are performed on black women. For good measure, she mentions that the organization’sfounder, Margaret Sanger, was an avowed racist. Most of the big political events of recent years are covered in the book, from Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing right up to the death of George Floyd in May this year. She uses the show trial that Justice Kavanaugh was subjected to as a perfect example of how modern feminism has moved from the advancement of women to the vilification of men. Owens likens the treatment of Kavanaugh following the accusations of sexual assault made by Kristine Blasey Ford, to those used by southern racists to justify lynchings of black men in the Jim Crow South. She excoriates the popular blacklivesmatter narrative around Floyd’s death and the entire movement. With characteristic forcefulness she demolishes the narrative that Floyd was a “gentle giant” turning his life around when he died during a botched arrest in Minneapolis, pointing out his lengthy criminal record and the autopsy which indicated he had several narcotics rolling around his system. But she says none of that matters, and Floyd has become yet another black idol. This idolatry of rappers and criminals, Owens’ argues, is yet another way the black community keeps itself down. She talks fondly of the culture of her grandfather’s generation, hard work, family values and Motown music, and damns its modern equivalent. Owens writes:“Black culture was once something to be proud of, but it no longer is. It has disintegrated into a web of likes and complacency. It is a perpetual diagnosis of our illness, running parallel to our endless denials of the antidote: the truth.” Her conclusion is one that flies in the face of theRobin DiAngelo’sof this world, that the ills of the black community are not the result of systemic racism and white supremacy, but that they are in fact“completely optional,”and the way out of them is to once again free themselves from the proverbial“plantation.” She says that much of black America has been kept in an equivalent of Plato’s Cave by the Democrats, a dishonest media, and race hustling “community leaders.” She writes that black conservatives like herself, who have“seen the light,”are likely to be met with resistance by those who still believe the shadows on the wall cast by the democraticparty that placates them with handouts rather than a hand up. The way out of this self-inflicted misery? Voting for Trump. The book is very partisan all the way through but, as one would expect given the timing of the release, her conclusion is where it gets most to the point. Trump, whom she knows personally, is the admittedly imperfect vessel to save black America. She reiterates Trump’s question of 2016“What have you got to lose? You’re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed, what the hell do you have to lose?” While you might not like Trump after reading Owens’ analysis, it is hard to see how pulling the lever for Biden will not just result in more of the same for the black community. We’ll see in November if Owens’ message cuts through or not. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"26 Sep, 2020", You look better without a suit : Trump pays bitter Covington rival Usman bizarre tribute as US president continues to court UFC,"A week after UFC welterweight Colby Covington won under his Keep America Great banner, Donald Trump has personally praised Kamaru Usman, who has been involved in a racism row featuring Covington and beat him last December. On the campaign trail ahead of the US presidential election in November, Trump continued to court key figures from the UFC who had turned up to support him, including Russian lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov s manager, Ali Abdelaziz, and welterweight champion Usman. Speaking at an event in Atlanta focusing on""black economic empowerment"", the Republican incumbent used his established ploy of pointing out the fighter in the crowd while quipping that he did not want to fight him. ""He s tough,""said Trump, who welcomed the man Usman knocked out at UFC 245 to the White House in 2018 and praised him backstage at a rally last week. Donald Trump praises UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman.Watch here:https://t.co/nab94hNMdi#MMA#DonaldTrump#Trump#MAGA2020LandslideVictory#MAGA2020#USA#UFC253#UFC#colbycovington#Americans#UNGA#kamaru#KeepAmericaGreat#FridayThoughtspic.twitter.com/U00leHVH21 ""Come on champ, get up. Man, oh man. What a fighter you are. I don t want to mess with him. I think I may weigh a couple of pounds more."" Trump s lavish praise for Usman is certain to infuriate Covington. After his win over Tyron Woodley last week, which had been at the center of a bitter political row between the pair in the build-up, the American taunted Usman and ignited accusations of racism by claiming that the Nigerian came from a""little tribe""that uses""smoke signals"". ""Who did you get a call from?""Covington asked Usman after a congratulatory exchange with the president, speaking as part of a spat that forced UFC president Dana White to deny that his remarks had been racist and insist that fighters were free to""speak their mind."" Covington s claim that he is the president s favorite fighter seems in doubt after Trump claimed to have watched Usman s decision win over Jorge Masvidal on ""Fight Island"" in July, calling his performance""unbelievable"". ""Talent, right up here too,""he added, pointing to his head.""The muscles are important but you ve got to have that too. ""He actually looks very good in a suit but he s one of the few people who looks better without a suit. There aren t too many of us – right, men? ""I just want to thank you, champ, and good luck to you... I ll be watching."" Trump has worked closely with White over the years, welcoming his fellow businessman to several of his rallies and consulting him on the return of sport in the US during the pandemic. Several fighters have dismissed the UFC s denials of any racist undertones to Covington s remarks, with some also arguing that the promotion should be engaging in the kind of high-profile blacklivesmatter protests that have been seen in the NBA and NFL. Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya, who headlines UFC 253 in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, said the response to Covington""shows you the landscape of the media, what it is right now."" Israel Adesanya addresses Colby Covington s comments over the weekend and feels that there is hypocracy in how he is covered by the media.pic.twitter.com/kw2QtziAmb Dana White says he doesn’t know what Colby Covington said that was racist#UFC253pic.twitter.com/SiviEf68j8 ""I made a joke about dropping [Yoel] Romero like the Twin Towers and everyone lost their mind, even if I said it was a joke and it was pretty funny,""Adesanya toldESPN.""But people took it as I was being offensive and like, digging. But I was making a joke. ""This guy [Covington] has directly insulted my culture, my brother and many other cultures, and no one says anything. But it just shows you a mirror."" A fierce critic of the social justice protests that have become prominent in the US this year, Trump turned his attention to talking to Hispanic Americans in another rally during the week, when welterweight fan favorite Masvidal was in attendance. In a description of Masvidal s achievements, the president appeared to be referring to his five-second knockout of Ben Askren last year when he mentioned""the fastest knockout"". ""I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings but [Askren] was supposed to be the future of the UFC but he had to go through this guy right here [and] it didn’t go well. Well nothing to do but laugh at that 🙄https://t.co/eDnCiuMP6o Can’t believe the president knows who I am. Humbled.

Two seconds? You ran across the ring and the guy was gone and that was the end of it. ""Did they have to pay you for that evening or not? Because one second…that’s a good return. This guy was a fighter on the street. He used to beat up people...and somebody said, ‘Come on (into) the gym. Let’s see if you’re so good.’ ""Then he goes into the gym and guys who are fighting for a long time, he beat the hell out of him. They said, ‘I think he’s going to be a good fighter,’ and they were right. But these are all different stories, right?” Askren was happy enough that Trump had called him a""young superstar""while recalling his lightning defeat, and Masvidal was overjoyed by the speech. ""Can’t believe the president knows who I am,""he said.""Humbled. Leader of the free world knows my name. ""President Trump knows of me. My father hasn’t stopped smiling.""

"25 Sep, 2020",New Travellers Lives Matter movement is absolutely necessary – they have been discriminated against in Britain for too long,"After decades of facing bigotry and intolerance, the travelling community, led by boxer Tyson Fury, are mobilising to fight for their rights. And they’ve every right to, because the discrimination they face is shocking. Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney It seems everyone who could protest has done so of late. And the latest group to mobilise are the travelling community. They made their public debut earlier this week in the town of Morecambe in Lancashire, North West England. The seemingly obscure location and copycat TLM (Travellers Lives Matter) slogan shouldn’t diminish the cause. As has been documented previously, travellers sufferrampant discriminationin the UK. Research has shown the police have a bias against them, they have problems registering with GPs and one study revealed 91 percent had experienced discrimination. But the straw that broke the camel’s back was footage of two men being refused entry to a pub, The Hurley Flyer. The doorman explained that bosses had instructed him to turn away any travellers. For the record, the pub hasdenied this is trueand said:“Under the circumstances a member of the appointed door security team believed they were acting with the best intentions of preserving the safety of our employees and guests, but was wrong to suggest there is a specific ban on any social group.” World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury was enraged by the incident, however, and reposted it to his millions of fans on social media. Fury was the focal point of the TLM protest, leading a crowd of hundreds as they marched to The Hurley Flyer. After that they headed off to another pub which allegedly refuses travellers entry too, The William Mitchell. It has been approached for comment but is yet to respond. Fury ranted,“It’s ok to be racist in 2020, it’s ok to persecute my people, it seems to be accepted... it’s about time we stand up and be counted like everybody else.” As a world-famous boxer, Fury is adept at attracting attention and making wild claims. Nevertheless, he is predicting a massive event is in the works, as he claimed,“I will be calling on maybe a million gypsies and travellers across Britain and Ireland to march in London very, very shortly…we shall have equal rights like everybody else.” Maybe we have all been anaesthetised by the recent movements such as#MeTooand blacklivesmatter , but travellers are in a truly dire situation. To have a doorman shamefully say that a single ethnic group is not allowed entry is a mirror image of black activist Rosa Parks being told to stand to allow a white person to sit down on a bus in Alabama back in the 50s. According to the travelling community, their kids are not welcome in some cinemas and one protester even accused a local garage of refusing to work on their cars. Part of the issue is that for too long a lazy stereotype has been allowed to build of travellers being layabouts, who steal things and disrupt local communities. There’s no question that they are responsible for some crime and anti-social behaviour. What ethnic group isn’t? But does this excuse the bigotry they face on a daily basis? For example, while there has been a concerted effort in recent times to use correct language and avoid stereotypes involving skin colour or religion, that hasn’t happened with travellers. They’ve been forgotten and there’s been no pressure from anywhere to correct that. This month a young manwas finedin court for anonymously ordering a banana to a black man’s table in a pub. If a similar tasteless prank was played on a traveller, it simply wouldn’t be given the same treatment. There are also commonly used slurs which never face the same backlash as homophobic or racial jibes. And has an MP ever stood up in the House of Commons and called for the injustice to end? Since July, three Conservative MPs (Robert Syms, Mark Jenkinson and Robert Halfon) have spoken to the media about the need to issue authorities with greater powers over travellers. In contrast, there appears to be no evidence of anyone in authority pleading the case for the travelling community. And while there have been briefing papers and reports issued by the government listing the issues facing travellers, these kinds of studies are produced regularly, seemingly to little effect. Indeed, the issue ofbadger cullinghas been given more attention by the British government and media. When a member of the weasel family is deemed more worthy of consideration than an entire group of people, the scale of the problem is evident. TLM has to be nurtured and supported. Role models are key. Like Fury, a lot of well-known boxers are travellers. Another contemporary figure is pop star Cher Lloyd. Because the community isn’t represented like others in the rest of society, this adds to the burden on high-profile figures to shoulder the load. There has to be a push to see them given more consideration in our judicial, education and medical systems. And has, for example, a traveller ever taken a seat in the House of Commons? Some form of representation is necessary. One protester speaking at the Morecambe march nailed it when he said,“If we don’t stand up for our rights, nobody else will do it.”That should not be the case. TLM is something we should all get behind; it’s a cause worth fighting for. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"24 Sep, 2020",Church sues pro- blacklivesmatter DC mayor Bowser over ‘celebrating mass protests’ while keeping ban on 100+ OUTDOOR worships,"A Baptist church in Washington, DC, has sued Mayor Muriel Bowser, alleging she has discriminated against churchgoes by endorsing and attending mass protests while refusing to lift restrictions on outdoor religious services. Capitol Hill Baptist Church (CHBC), a leading Baptist congregation in DC, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, naming Bowser, known for her vocal support of the blacklivesmatter protests, and the District of Columbia as plaintiffs. In itscomplaint, the church says that it“takes no issue”with the DC officials’ decision to greenlight mass blacklivesmatter rallies, since they are“themselves protected by the First Amendment,”but“takes exception to Defendants’ decision to favor certain expressive gatherings over others.” The lawsuit cites multiple occasions on which Bowser defied her own coronavirus restrictions for the sake of promoting the protesters’ cause. On June 6, 2020, the complaint states, Bowser“appeared personally at an outdoor gathering of tens of thousands of people...describing the large gathering as “wonderful to see.” The church said that it asked Bowser’s office for a waiver on its services as far back as on June 10 for the request to have been met with a deafening silence. After its first application fell through, the church resubmitted it on September 1 and got a “no” last Tuesday. The lawsuit claims that when confronted about the issue, Bowser dodged the question, emphasizing the right of the people to protest freely instead. When asked why she celebrates mass protests while houses of worship remain closed, she responded that “First Amendment protests and large gatherings are not the same” because “in the United States of America, people can protest.” The church says that its members“reluctantly voted”to initiate proceedings against the mayor seeking to“reclaim their most fundamental of rights: the right to gather for corporate worship free from the threat of governmental sanction.” The coronavirus policy, that is now in force in DC, caps the number of attendees at religious gatherings at 100 people or 50 percent capacity, depending on which figure is fewer. The restrictions apply to both indoor and outdoor services. CHBC is not the first US church to challenge the sweeping restrictions imposed on the larger in-person religious services amid the Covid-19 pandemic, alleging bias by state officials. Last month, a Grace Community Church in suburban Los Angeles sued California for effectively giving“favored protesters”a carte blanche to trample on the law. Think your friends would be interested?

"24 Sep, 2020",United States of Anarchy: Are Democratic leaders partnering with the rabble to dethrone Trump?,"The war of words between Democrats and the White House ramped up this week as Trump moved to defund cities that prevent police “from doing their jobs.” Will this partisan brinkmanship lead the US straight to the abyss in November? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge The Democratic mayors of New York City, Portland and Seattleissueda joint statement earlier this week in which they accused Donald Trump of“playing cheap political games”after the US leader disqualified their cities from receiving billions of dollars in federal support. Some may argue Trump was right to act as he did, considering that the mayors slashed the budgets of their police forces at the very same time radical activists were burning and looting Main Street. This week, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, chastised the Democratic leaders for refusing to“undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities”amid the blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests that erupted across the country following the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in May. “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,”Barrwrotein a statement on the Department of Justice website.“It is my hope that the cities identified… will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.” Although there is considerable doubt as to whether Trump has the legal authority to deprive cities of federal cash – New York City, for example,receives$7 billion annually from Washington – the Republicans are not about to miss an opportunity to reprimand the Democrats, especially when the country is heading into the final lap before Election Day. With that said, however, Trump seems to have ample justification for punishing the Democrats for their handling of this hot protest season. Although politicians would be expected to demand that their police forces display restraint amid the blacklivesmatter protests, a line must be drawn at full-blown anarchy. In some Democrat-run cities, however, that line never seemed to exist. And if it did exist, it was drawn so far down the road as to be altogether meaningless. Seattle: Antifa black bloc rioters force police vehicles away.#AntifaRiotspic.twitter.com/0RrQPvsimB Consider, for example, the decision by Seattle authorities in June to let protesters seize a six-square-block zone – dubbed the ‘Capitol Hill Occupied Protest’ (CHOP) – which Mayor Jenny Durkan downplayed as the“summer of love,”a remark that has not aged well. Seattle’s brave experiment in anarchistic, police-free living came to a screeching halt in just a matter of weeks aftersporadicshootingsleft two people dead and several others injured. New York City also made Barr’s blacklist, thanks to Mayor Bill de Blasio s decision tocut$1 billion from the New York Police Department’s annual budget at a time when shootings havesoared165 percent in the Big Apple and murders are up by almost 50 percent. Meanwhile, across the country in Portland, city residents just marked a grim milestone: 100 consecutive nights of protests, marred by the destruction of public and private property, violence, and even death. Incredibly, however, Mayor Ted Wheeler – who was forced to find a new home after repeated protests and even anarsonoutside the condominium complex where he was residing – has forbade law enforcement from using tear gas, perhaps the most effective deterrent against mob violence short of deadly firearms. After months of protests, police officers in Portland, Oregon, will no longer use tear gas for crowd controlhttps://t.co/x5fv5zaaCM At this point, it must be asked:“What in the hell are the Democrats thinking?”Few people would doubt the need for overhauling trigger-happy police departments. But reducing their budget to the point of redundancy, as the Democrats are doing, does not seem to be the best remedy; courting the mob at the very same time you are disparaging and decreasing funding for law enforcement is fraught with risk. So why haven’t the Democrats taken a no-nonsense stance against the troublemakers? One possible explanation is that the Democrats, who have been trying to oust Donald Trump since before he even set foot in the White House, had set a trap for the Republican leader. It seems they were anticipating that the brash, tough-talking Trump would eventually lose his patience as the rioters continued with their wave of destruction, which the mainstream media has gone togreat lengthsto sanitize. In an effort to restore some semblance of law and order, Trump would send in the cavalry with both guns blazing and a blood bath would predictably ensue – exactly the sort of calamity that would destroy any hope of reelection. If that is the game the Democrats were playing, they seriously underestimated the US leader... again. Against the advice of many Republicans, Trump has taken limited and measured actions against the rioters, letting the Democrats simmer in a stew of their own making. At the same time, he is constantly reminding Americans that the Democrats are to blame for the mayhem, which shows little sign of abating. That leaves the Democrats with just one option: blame Trump for the violence in return. “He doesn t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat, and he s stoking violence in our cities,”Bidentoldan audience during a recent stop in Pittsburgh.“He can t stop the violence because for years he s fomented it. Finally, there is one more possible reason why the Democrats have taken such a kid-glove approach to the mob, and I’ll just cut right to the chase: the Democrats may be inclined to use these street protesters in the event that Trump emerges victorious against Biden on November 3. It should not be forgotten that a number of high-ranking Democrats, includingHillary Clinton,Maxine WatersandKamala Harris, have strongly hinted at a bitter fight down the road with the Republicans. So if the Democrats’ aim really is to contest the results of the election, the most effective way of doing that is to employ a ‘color revolution’ scenario, where thousands of people – egged on by blacklivesmatter and Antifa – come out onto the streets in mass protest. The Washington establishment has some experience in such things. Whether or not they would be so bold as to resort to such actions inside of their own country remains to be seen. However, since the year 2020 has been full of wild surprises, few of them enjoyable, I can only anticipate the worst on November 3. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"21 Sep, 2020","‘We’ll take care of business’: Trump downplays threats of Democrat violence if he wins re-election, but vows tough response","President Donald Trump is largely avoiding discussion of the threats of post-election violence made by left-wing groups, but when pressed on the issue, he says any such mayhem will be quickly quashed. “We want to win, and once we win, we’ll take care of business,”Trump said in an interview with podcast host Dan Bongino, posted on Monday.“We’ll take care of business.” Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, noted that groups such as theTransition Integrity Project– which has ties to billionaire activism donorGeorge Soros– have pledged a“street fight”if Trump tries to claim victory in the November 3 election. The interview with Trump was recorded on Friday, just before Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. The prospect of Trump filling another seat on the court added more vitriol to the nation’s already toxic political divide. Former CNN host Reza Aslan was among the leftists who threatened violence if a Trump nominee is confirmed by the Senate this year, saying,“Over our dead bodies. Literally,”and adding,“If they even try to replace RBG, we will burn the entire f***ing thing down.” Over our dead bodies. Literally.https://t.co/rQbvuKakHU And he wasn’t the only one.Beau Willimon, producer of Netflix’s‘House of Cards’, said Democrats are“shutting this country down”if Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell try to ram through a Ginsburg replacement. Democrat lawmakers, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts), have repeatedly called for violence during Trump’s presidency. Pressley said last month that“there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there’s unrest in our lives.” Trump has blamed politicians in Democrat-run cities for enabling the violent blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests that have occurred across the country since May, when George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody. The Department of Justice said on Monday that New York, Seattle, and Portland have been branded“anarchist jurisdictions”and therefore won’t receive federal law enforcement funding because they have refused to“undertake reasonable measures”to counteract crime. Trump told Bongino that rioting and rising crime would be easily quelled in such cities if they were willing to accept federal government help. “The greatest would be Portland,”he said.“I could stop that in a half-hour. That’s easy. They’re anarchists. They’re spoiled kids for the most part. They live in the basement of their mother’s home.”He added that such“agitators”would like to see an overthrow of the government, but“that’s not going to happen. The country has great spirit.” Bongino also pressed Trump on what would happen if Twitter and other social media companies tried to block him from getting his messages out in the aftermath of a contested election.“I would take it right to the Supreme Court,”the president said, adding that his administration would do everything possible to strip social media platforms of their Section 230 liability protections. “The funny thing is, I protect them more than the Democrats,”he said.“I actually protect them, because I want to see great companies – I don’t want to see China take over. I think [even] the Democrats would want to repeal Section 230.”He predicted that social media giants would go out of business, were they to lose their Communications Decency Act liability shield.

"21 Sep, 2020",Inspiring or cringe-worthy? Emmys host Jimmy Kimmel ordered to shout ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ in racially charged skit (VIDEO),"The 2020 Emmys didn’t shy away from social justice issues, with host Jimmy Kimmel serving as a punching bag for ‘white privilege’ jokes. The routine predictably created deep divisions on social media. The entertainment awards ceremony, held at Los Angeles’ Staples Center with a ‘cardboard audience’, and dubbed by Kimmel as the ‘Pand-Emmys’, didn’t limit itself to quips about coronavirus. In a provocative monologue, actor Anthony Anderson noted that there was a record number of black Emmy nominees this year, before turning to Kimmel and telling him:“This is the part where the white people start to applaud and nod.” The black entertainer then lamented that nominees and guests couldn’t attend the ceremony in person, claiming that“y’all wouldn’t be able to handle how black it was gonna be.”Despite the setback, Anderson said that he was“still rooting for everybody black because black stories, black performances, and blacklivesmatter .” Then things got really awkward. Anderson ordered Kimmel to chant the popular slogan and complained that Kimmel wasn’t saying it loud enough. “Say it with me, Jimmy. Louder, Jimmy. Say it so that Mike Pence could hear it,”he quipped. I honestly don’t know what to say here other than WTF..pic.twitter.com/M0kaFPLZm1 The routine faced considerable backlash on social media, with many arguing that the exchange was demeaning and even racist. Not entertaining. Lecturing. Demeaning white people whilst demanding extra ordinary respect from them. Demanding they cower in the presence if anyone with another complexion that is not white= racists Others observed that the“joke”clearly demonstrates how blacklivesmatter supporters demand loyalty and punish those who refuse to voice solidarity with their cause – a scenario that has played out numerous times during protests across the country. The setup for this routine is that Jimmy Kimmel, a white man, yields to the belligerent black actor because the social consequences of not doing so would be severe..... and there’s no punchline because it isn’t a joke.pic.twitter.com/MgAEbj30zD The comedy sketch was also criticized as excessively self-righteous virtual signaling. Manynotedthat Kimmel had caught flak for wearing blackface in an old skit, and that Anderson has beenaccusednumerous times of sexual assault. However, others argued that the provocative performance illustrated the growing political influence of the blacklivesmatter movement. One commentpredictedthat“black folks won’t be quiet”in November and would vote out Donald Trump. Hollywood has taken steps to brand itself as ‘woke’, following allegations that it discriminates against women and minorities. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced new standards of representation and inclusion when considering films for Oscar awards. The new guidelines could come into effect at the 96th Academy Awards in 2024. Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"21 Sep, 2020","Irreconcilable politics: Texas woman VOWS TO LEAVE Trump-supporting husband if he doesn t vote Biden, sets Twitter on fire","A Texas woman said she s so fed up with her husband s support for President Donald Trump that she will leave him if he doesn t vote for Democrat challenger Joe Biden – a reflection of political polarization in the MAGA era. ""I m married to a Trump supporter,""the woman, identified as Beverly M, said on Saturday on Twitter.""I m serious that if he doesn t come around and vote for Biden-Harris, I will not stay around."" I’m married to a Trump supporter. I’m serious that if he doesn’t come around and vote for Biden/Harris I will not stay around. I married him before Trump was elected. I voted for Hillary. It’s been a rough 4 years to say the least. The woman identifies herself as a blacklivesmatter supporter on Twitter and said she moved to Texas from the Midwest in the 1980s. She said she married her husband before Trump was elected, and she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.""It s been a rough four years, to say the least,""she added. Beverly M said that with so much at stake in the 2020 election, she considers Trump supporters to be selfish.""That s why I am angry at my husband,""she said.""When I m begging him to do this for our children... and for our future grandchildren and that doesn t matter to him, that s eye-opening."" Her tweets met with largely humorous reaction, such as a commentator who tweeted:""If she s husband shopping, I d recommend Portland,""and another who said:""Karen, it s going to be a rough four more.""Australian journalist Rita Panahi posted a GIF of an angry woman trashing a house and said in the caption:""That s just incentivizing a vote for Trump."" If she s husband-shopping, I d recommend Portland. Karen, it s going to be a rough four more. ;) That’s just incentivising a vote for Trump.https://t.co/L9oQuwtJmEpic.twitter.com/k6LehlQXNQ But Beverly M s plight hit home with many Twitter users, who spoke of their own marital and family conflicts over politics in recent years. Some said they ve avoided family gatherings since 2016, and another said he could no longer respect his mother and stepfather because they lack""the capacity to think freely.""One woman said she broke up with her Trump-supporting boyfriend last summer:""To me, not supporting Trump is a moral decision, and to him, it s only political. I couldn t keep pretending that I had [not] lost respect for him."" My relationships with family are very strained and have been since I told them how I felt during last election. I can’t imagine what it must be like for you. You have my sympathy. I have not went to a family gathering since the 2016 election. I did attend my fathers funeral but left immediately afterward. It’s sad yes but I’m not going to be around bigots. Me neither. I ve seen my dad maybe 5 times since 2016. I’d rather create new relationships with people who have the capacity to think freely. I can’t respect my mother and step father any longer. They blindly follow without the slightest ability to comprehend anything that doesn’t come from Fox News. I truly feel for you. I broke up with my Trump supporter boyfriend last summer because I had to face that we fundamentally didn t agree. To me, not supporting Trump is a moral decision and to him, it s only political. I couldn t keep pretending that I had lost respect for him. Marital tensions over politics have escalated since Trump was elected in 2016 and are likely intensifying again as his November re-election bid approaches. A 2017studyby US polling firm Wakefield Research found that one in 10 couples had ended their relationships over political differences. Millennials were more than twice as likely to have broken off a marriage or serious relationship, at a rate of 22 percent. One in five couples argued even more about Trump than about money, Wakefield said. While most couples have looked for ways to work through political differences – radio host Michelangelo Signorilesaidhis show had become like a support group for""Democrat women married to MAGA men""– many have given up. A Harper s Bazaar magazinearticlein 2017 went so far as to tell readers:""If your partner is a Trump supporter and you are not, just divorce them."" The reasoning in the article was revealing:""Supporting Trump at this point does not indicate a difference of opinions. It indicates a difference of values.""And it concluded:"" My partner s views are morally repulsive to me is one of the best reasons I can think of""to divorce. The mainstream media and democraticparty have framed opposition to Trump as a moral issue. His policies and conduct aren t merely wrong or unwise – they are immoral and""violate norms.""Media figures such as CNN hostsJake TapperandDon Lemonuse words such as ""heinous"" and ""racist"" to describe Trump s actions. Biden and his vice-presidential running mate, Kamala Harris, have billed their campaign as a battle for""the soul of America."" That might seem an ironic theme from a party often portrayed as hostile to religion. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats believe the Bible should have at least some influence on US laws, according to Pew Research Centerdata. But when it comes to Trump, Democrats like Beverly M have clearly gotten the moral message. ""It s much more than a political opinion,"" Beverly Mtweeted.""It s about morality, ethics, values, etc."" Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"19 Sep, 2020","African Americans want black national anthem and black-only towns, but that s borrowing from the white supremacist playbook","Under the pretense of ‘systemic racism’, black racial justice groups in the United States are advocating on behalf of radical measures that threaten to tear apart the colorful fabric of the diverse nation forever. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Just before his untimely death in 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King summed up the reality of the United States when he said,“We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.”The message was unmistakable: in order for the world’s greatest experiment in democracy and multiculturalism to succeed, its people must focus on what unites them as opposed to what drives them apart. Today, however, the“same boat”that King referenced is sinking below the waves of racial strife, and not even the sports world is exempt. In fact, it was on the ‘field of dreams’ where much of the current antagonism first began. In 2016, former NFL quarterback-turned professional activist Colin Kaepernick ‘took a knee’ during the playing of the national anthem to protest police brutality. Predictably, the gesture polarized the country, even causing dedicated sports fans to change the channel. Internal NFL memo sent to address concern as to why ratings this season are so far down 11%pic.twitter.com/SitMveCr8q The real challenge, however, came with the death of George Floyd, when local and state Democratic leaders, forced to respond to ‘peaceful’ street protests, found it more politically expedient to genuflect on behalf of the blacklivesmatter s movement than to put an end to the violence. Since then, the demands on behalf of activist groups have not gone away; indeed, they have become ever more radicalized. This week, the National Football League – where some 70 percent of players are black, by the way –kicked offthe 2020 season by playing a rendition of the ‘black national anthem’, entitled ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’. Needless to say, not a single player on the field was caught kneeling as that song rang out through a mostly-empty, pandemic-stricken stadium. Minutes later, however, dozens of players kneeled for the playing of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’, written by Francis Scott Key to commemorate the American flag during the War of 1812. The question of national allegiance notwithstanding, does America really need two national anthems? After all, that would only fuel the dangerous notion that there are two separate ‘nations’ with two separate peoples inside of one country. At the same time, who is going to break the news to America’s large Latino population, for example, or the Asian one, that they can’t have their own national anthems played at sporting events, too? Although there are solid grounds for arguing (as my colleague Chris Sweeney hasproposedon these pages) that the beloved ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ could do with a modern makeover in light of some of its racist overtones, should we really toss out the baby with the dirty bath water? Americans have already witnessed the removal of hundreds of statues of historical figures who had some connection to slavery and the oppression of minorities (and even some who do not); does the country really need to start trashing its oral and written record as well? That is a slippery slope that could lead to national disintegration. The iconic Teddy Roosevelt statue in front of the Museum of Natural History on the west side of Central Park being removed. As a New Yorker and a museum nerd this one hurts. 😔pic.twitter.com/StwBn9tfGk The very essence of this debate, however, ignores a crucial historical fact: although Americans are certainly guilty of many odious crimes against humanity, with slavery topping the list, few people have sacrificed more to correct those wrongs than the Americans themselves. The most obvious example is the Civil War (1861-1865), which was at least partially fought to end the institution of slavery and prevent the Confederate states from seceding from the Union. It is estimated that up to one million Americans lost their lives in that conflict. Yet today, with no loss of irony, some black people are attempting to ‘secede’ from the US with the goal of creating their own territory inside of the country. This week it was reported that 19 families purchased 100 acres of land in Georgia to create a“safe haven”for black families. “It s about a safe haven. It s about having a place where you can be authentically black, unapologetically black and not be judged,”Ashley Scott, one of the new residents of Liberty, Georgia,toldlocal media.“Our 96 acres is to [serve as a] safe haven for … retreats, and reunions and weddings, trails for hunting, a lake for fishing and a place for us to just breathe.” One of the main problems with that project, of course, is its glaring hypocrisy. After all, whenever white Americans have attempted in the past to create such ‘safe places’, the kneejerk reaction was to condemn them as ‘white supremacists’ and knuckle-dragging xenophobes. The other contradiction is that the creation of walled-off, race-based communities is fundamentally anti-American to the core. Black Americans seeking their own fenced-off land is no better than the white segregationist ‘back of the bus’ policies that led to the ferocious civil rights battles of the 1960s. In other words, African Americans are wandering down the same dark alley that their white brothers did decades ago, and if they think the results will somehow turn out better for them this time around they are sadly mistaken. The way to cure racism in the United States is not by each racial group seeking shelter behind their own fortifications, behind their own anthems, behind their own flags, but rather for Americans to rally around the“solid rock of brotherhood,”to quote King once again. It is truly the only way forward. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"18 Sep, 2020",Liberal rage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s inclusion on assignment about ‘heroes’ will teach schools to ban independent thought,"The outpouring of rage over the inclusion of Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse in a Dallas teacher’s assignment on historical figures that also included victim Joseph Rosenbaum proves the real problem is with critical thinking. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram A Dallas high school English teacher handed students an assignment titled ‘Hero for the Modern Age’ that asked them to write up half-page biographies of beloved historical figures as diverse as Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X, and Cesar Chavez – as well as more contemporary (and controversial) figures Rittenhouse, Rosenbaum, and Minneapolis police brutality casualty George Floyd himself. They were also told to select one of the names and write about how they fulfilled the student’s definition of a hero. Under normal circumstances, one might expect people to take issue with the inclusion of Rosenbaum, a convicted sex offender whose last words werereportedly(and repeatedly) “Shoot me, n***a!” or even Floyd, who allegedly held a gun to a pregnant black woman’s stomach in the course of burglarizing her home years ago. But given current trends in secondhand outrage, and the posthumous canonization of Floyd as patron saint of blacklivesmatter , it was the inclusion of Rittenhouse – the 17-year-old gunman who shot Rosenbaum and two others in Kenosha during that city’s riots – who actually triggered the calls for the teacher’s cancellation. Dubbed a “white supremacist” and charged with first-degree murder, even after it emerged that one of the men he shot was actually pointing a gun at him, Rittenhouse has become a liberal bogeyman beyond his tender years. A Dallas activist exposed teacher Paul Ford as being behind the assignment on Twitter, throwing his career into jeopardy by publicizing his “APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE” [caps in original] essay prompt. CNN claimed to have spoken to an actual student at the school, one Kristian, who was reportedly shocked by the (admittedly bewildering) misspelling of “Malcom [sic] X” and the lack of female options for the “hero” essay that her brother had been assigned. “The fact that a white supremacist murderer’s name is on a list with important historical figures” was what “very ardently” set Kristian off, according to the cable news outlet. It’s not clear what made Rosenbaum or Floyd “important historical figures” while Rittenhouse wasn’t, but the contemporary trio’s presence next to the better-known historical figures might have given more open-minded students a new perspective on current events. Paul Ford is an English teacher at@WTWHighSchoolin#DallasISD This is an actual assignment - giving students an opportunity to write an essay about how#Kenoshamurderer Kyle Rittenhouse is a ""hero."" APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE.pic.twitter.com/CB7jY1A7pu Such a thing is verboten in 21st century child-rearing, which centers on ensuring kids are raised with the “right” ideas. The backlash to the Dallas teacher’s unorthodox assignment was for all intents and purposes a left-wing mirror image of the pearl-clutching conservative parents who’d freaked out over a cartoon handed out by a Westchester, New York teacher earlier this month that compared police officers to the KKK. While the cartoon was enough to upset any pro-cop parent, the assignment that accompanied it – which essentially bullied kids into swearing fealty to blacklivesmatter – should have been a bigger deal. If anything, the Texas schoolteacher’s assignment left a wider range of opinions open to students than his New York counterpart, as the teacher made it clear the finished paper would only be graded on spelling, grammar, “clarity,” and completeness (whether they’d followed the instructions requesting five paragraphs or more). Nowhere did the teacher suggest one of the names was more heroic than the others. But neither the angry Westchester parents nor their incensed peers in Dallas seemed capable of understanding that encouraging their kids to think outside their comfort zone might actually be beneficial in creating a world where there are no Rittenhouses or cops=KKK cartoons. American parents have been trained to expect obedient children – and to deem their kids defective when they ask too many questions – but not to dig deeper and seriously contemplate what a world full of independently-thinking young people might bring in terms of benefits. Whereas 2020’s blacklivesmatter protest crowds have essentially been at the mercy of the person with the loudest voice – whether they demand the rest shout slogans endlessly or raid the nearest Target – a group of youngsters capable of independent thought would not be so easily led astray. As if mainstream media’s condemnation of the teacher who foolishly expected some independent thought from his students wasn’t bad enough, the school district actually went along with the public shaming. They profusely apologized for the assignment, claiming it had not been “approved” and removing it from prostrating themselves before the diversity gods, declaring “racial equity is a top priority in Dallas ISD” and bloviating about their commitment to “be culturally sensitive to our diverse populations” – though an untrained eye might say the teacher’s list of potential heroes had been very diverse indeed, what with an Indian, two black men, and one Hispanic alongside the two white men. Promoting diversity and independent thought, in one assignment?! No teacher will make that mistake again – much to the detriment of their students. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"16 Sep, 2020","The furore over a blacklivesmatter dance routine proves that there are plenty of snowflakes on the offence-seeking, censorship-loving Right","Dance troupe Diversity’s blacklivesmatter routine on Britain’s Got Talent has received a record number of complaints, showing how much the Right loves censorship, seeks offence and lacks self-awareness. The snowflakes should toughen up. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. There have been some pretty offensive things on Simon Cowell’s Britain’s Got Talent and its myriad spin-off franchises across this seemingly doomed planet of ours. Not least the tediously predictable formula, the sight of Simon Cowell’s armpit-threateningly-high trousers and, of course, ventriloquists. And yet none of them, it seems, has ever been as offensive in the eyes of many Brits as a dance routine. Theroutine in questionwas by the dance troupe Diversity, winners of 2009’s BGT and led by Ashley Banjo, a man currently sitting in Cowell’s judge’s chair while the Lord of Lowbrow recovers from a broken back, bless him. (They say it was from falling off his electric bike, but I think it was caused by the weight of expectation that he unearth another Jedward.) Diversity, dressed in all-black, performed the routine - similar to one they published onYouTubein July - to an updated version of Tomfoolery’s ‘viral sensation’ poemThe Great Realisationand the track blacklivesmatter by Dax. It referred to Covid-19 before moving on to institutional racism. At one point, a dancer dressed as a cop knelt on Banjo’s neck. All very 2020. While poignant, it was quite ham-fisted and that fist didn’t exactly deliver a devastating punch (it was a dance routine, after all). But still it was too much for the nation’s more conservative minds. Politics? That they don’t agree with? On a prime-time Saturday TV show? Presented by Ant and Dec? How. Very. Dare. They. Bloody lefty liberal BBC! Sorry, I mean ITV! The last time I looked, the routine had attracted more than 21,000 complaints to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. This, by the way, is A LOT. The highest number of complaints about any programme in 2019 was 2,717. What’s interesting about the numbers is that the complaints snowballed over the days following the show. Usually, they come in at the time of broadcast or shortly afterwards, perhaps once the enraged viewer has finished their glass of sherry or their hands have stopped shaking enough for them to tap out a furious missive. Instead, they kept on coming, day after day after day, well beyond the following Saturday. This implies one thing: These people were seeking out things to offend them. You know, just like sensitive woke snowflakes. They read about the complaints, heard about the routine, were probably told how disgusting it was by some like-minded acquaintances on Facebook, and decided to kick up a fuss - possibly without even watching it. And thus it spread, like a pandemic of resentment for which the only cure would be a grovelling apology from ITV (which, thankfully, didn’t come). Now, I’m exceedingly happy for anyone to rib anyone for getting a bit touchy over seemingly small things (I’m doing it right now). I’m also very happy for the people accused of being touchy to defend themselves. That only seems fair. But it’s not cool to be a great big hypocrite about it - and every single one of these right-leaning moaners was being hypocritical. They were very much pots calling the kettles black (they probably think that you can be ‘arrested and thrown in prison’ for using that saying these days). This was the same slice of society who, just days before, was arguing for more of its kind of politics to be on the BBC, specifically via the medium of LOLs. More right-wing comedy was needed, it said. But no dances against racism, apparently. That’s just ruining everyone’s Saturday night entertainment. They want to separate art and politics. Or rather art and mildly subversive politics. That way lies tyranny, though, and we don’t need any help moving in that direction, thank you very much - the train has long departed and we’re all aboard for the ride. Art is how politics of all flavours have been expressed for centuries. I’ll admit, I wasn’t expecting anything even vaguely interesting to emerge from the BGT stage, but whatever you thought of Diversity’s message or artistic merit, they absolutely had the right to give it a go. People need to remember that those in power are always going to be targeted more by the arts, because that’s the whole point of it. If all art is pro-government, well, there are names for that. So if you have a right-wing government, as the UK has had for a long time, then your satire and artistic output might appear to lean left. But that seems a small price to pay when you get things like all the laws and most of the national press going your way. It’s not a good look to demand that your politics be broadcast but no-one else’s. It’s called censorship. Not that this has stopped people making such demands, particularly of the BBC, but they shouldn’t get what they want just because they chuck a few toys out of their pram or have columns in the mainstream media. This is the same Beeb, by the way, which handed out a perpetual roasting to Jeremy Corbyn, the one vaguely left-wing party leader the country has had this century,including via its comedy shows. So it does take a swipe leftwards on the rare occasion that there’s something there to aim at. You also can’t accuse ‘the left’ of not being able to take a joke when you’re touchier than Joe Biden and Donald Trump at a beauty pageant. You can’t bang on about ‘freedom of speech’ and ‘it’s just my opinion’ when deep down you don’t want people you disagree with to be able to air their opinions - not even through the very silly medium of dance. You can’t call people out for being constantly offended, or for hunting down things to be offended by, when you’re doing exactly the same. You can’t get upset because, forone year only, someone wasn’t going tosing the lyricsto an old song in an empty hall, and then mock ‘liberals’ for capitalising the word Black. You can’t cry ‘woke madness’ because you’ve been baited by an emoji of ‘Mx Claus’ and then accuse trans rights advocates of being thin-skinned. It’s like when a fat person calls another person fat. It might be true, but everyone laughs at the first fat person. Not because they’re fat, that wouldn’t be nice, but because they’re utterly devoid of self-awareness. So, the Right, conservatives or however you want to label the kind of people who complained in their droves about Diversity (even that name will have people going off like a leaky pressure cooker) have a choice: toughen up or stop being the pot. By the way, if you’re wondering what caused those record 2,717 complaints last year, it was when Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow said of a pro-Brexit rally that he’d“never seen so many white people in one place.” I wonder who got upset about that?

"15 Sep, 2020","‘Disarm the police’ is the latest crackpot idea from the Democrats, who seemingly want to be seen as the party of anarchy","Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey has called for police to be deprived of weapons as mobs run riot across the US. This is immoral and irresponsible. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall The democraticparty , for reasons best known to itself, seems to be running an internal competition to see which one of its candidates can display the most stupid attitude towards the police. In the wake of protests from blacklivesmatter s, they are writing off every police department in America as essentially an evil force of oppression, rather than acknowledging the need for reform while still standing with the boys and girls in blue. From sea to shining sea, law enforcement officers in the United States are being denounced left, right and center (or should that be left, left and left?) by Democrat candidates. Biden has conceded that the police are systemically racist, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, AOC and others have called for cop shops across the land to be defunded, and Kamala Harris went to Wisconsin tovisit the family of Jacob Blake, an alleged sex criminal who reached for a knife as he was being arrested and was consequently shot by officers. Noticeably she has made no such effort to visitthe two LA police officerswho were victims of an unprovoked assassination attempt in Compton last weekend. One might think it odd for a California senator to visit a criminal’s family in Milwaukee rather than law enforcement officers in her home state, especially when said senator used to be the state’s Attorney General. But not in 2020. Thelatest Democratto come out with an unequivocally cretinous policy suggestion regarding the police is Massachusetts senator Ed Markey. Clearly emboldened after beating a Kennedy in his primary, he is now clamoring for national relevance by giving his opinion on policing in the USA. Markey’s suggestion is that now is a good time to“disarm”the police. What a sterling idea that is. At a moment of national unrest, in a country with the most heavily armed citizenry in the world,during a year when 34 officershave been deliberately killed by gunfire in the line of duty, Markey wants to deprive them of a means of defense. To be fair to the senator, he doesn’t want to deprive cops of all weaponry, just the“weapons of war”they are apparently swanning about the nation with. Sticking his nose in on matters concerning the riot-ravaged city of Portland (over 3,000 miles away from Massachusetts, incidentally) he tweeted:“Portland police routinely attack peaceful protestors with brute force. We must disarm these officers, and every other police department in America, of weapons of war, and enact a nationwide ban on tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets, and bean bag rounds.” Portland police routinely attack peaceful protestors with brute force. We must disarm these officers, and every other police department in America, of weapons of war, and enact a nationwide ban on tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets, and bean bag rounds.https://t.co/PDZcjhmSLB I’ve no idea what ‘war’ movies Mr Markey has been watching, but his choice of words is rather dramatic. After, all I was very much under the impression that soldiers in conflict tended to use live ammunition rather than rubber bullets and bean bag rounds. Tear gas, I would also wager, is rather low down the list of modern military weapons used in the field, especially by the US military, which, under Barack Obama’s tenure, favoured drones and Hellfire missiles. Markey also failed to suggest what other methods officers trying to contain a riot should use in lieu of these tried and tested measures. Presumably, he’d favor bringing in social workers to try to orchestrate some sort of group therapy over megaphones to the mob, if they could be distracted from setting stuff on fire and liberating Louis Vuitton handbags long enough to listen. Markey’s nonsense suggestions echo those of Portland’s pathetic Mayor Ted Wheeler, who recently directed the city’s police department to stop using CS gas against the “peaceful” protesters who have turned the city into a warzone virtually every night since May 25. Mayor Wheeler was probably put off tear gas after he decided to virtue-signal to the mob and expose himself to it in a pitiful display that resulted in him fleeing as a horde of leftist thugs called him a fascist. Oregon State Policehave saidthat Wheeler’s order was“reckless and short sighted,”while Portland Police Bureau described it as dangerous,stating,“Banning the lawful use of CS will make it very difficult to address this kind of violence without resorting to much higher levels of physical force, with a correspondingly elevated risk of serious injury to members of the public and officers.” I know that the Republicans have branded themselves as the party of law and order, but it doesn’t follow that the Democrats have to actively come out as the party of lawlessness. Their irresponsible rhetoric regarding policing in America is almost certainly stoking the fires of racial tension across the country. Their wholesale acceptance of blacklivesmatter ’s revolutionary social justice agenda is irresponsible and dangerous. It is presumably for this reason that the largest police union in the US,The Fraternal Order of Police, has formally endorsed Donald Trump’s campaign. Joe Biden’s run for office is one of the most cynical I can remember; it appears to essentially consist of blackmailing the electorate with violence. ‘Vote for me and the riots will stop’ is the message, which ignores the fact that the rioting is taking place in Democrat-run cities that refuse aid from the federal government and denounce it as an ‘occupation’ when it is sent in anyway. Americans should resolutely refuse to be cowed into submission by the persistent threat of leftist violence, and Democrats, like Markey, should be ashamed of the way they are helping to fan its flames.

"14 Sep, 2020",Protests over the shooting of a crazed knifeman who charged at cops prove blacklivesmatter and Antifa just want to watch America burn,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is the latest US city hit by mass unrest following a police shooting. Bodycam footage shows the cops were entirely justified, but the protesters don’t care about facts – they just want to cause trouble. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Has anyone noticed that blacklivesmatter s’ chosen martyrs seem to be getting harder to have sympathy for? They began withBreonna Taylor, a woman who was caught in the crossfire by police after a shootout ensued between cops who raided her apartment, searching for drugs, and her boyfriend. According to reports, officers from the police department in Louisville, Kentucky, fired over 20 shots, eight of which struck the blameless Taylor, who died at the scene. Taylor was an emergency medical technician who died tragically in what was clearly an accident. Upset over her death in March of this year was understandable. Then, in May, we had the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which served as the lightning rod for global demonstrations. After footage went viral of Floyd yelling that he couldn’t breathe as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck until he died, protests erupted across America and the world, and haven’t stopped since. His death initially seemed a clear-cut case of police brutality and excessive force. He didn’t appear to be resisting in the first video clip that went viral, and it sparked international condemnation. It later transpired that Floyd had acocktail of drugsin his system that would have made Keith Richards blush, and had actually refused to get into the patrol car after numerous requests from the arresting officers. An autopsy found that he died from a cardiac arrest that these narcotics may well have contributed to, and not from asphyxiation, although his family dispute this. It also transpired that Floyd was a career criminal who’d been in and out of prison for much of his life, and had, at one point, threatened a pregnant woman with a gun during a robbery. No one would argue he deserved his fate, but the case was more complicated than it initially appeared, and protestations that a 46-year-old man on fentanyl and cocaine was turning his life around seem unlikely to say the least. Regardless of his past failings, he should not have died in the manner he did. Then we moved on toJacob Blake, who didn’t die in his encounter with the cops in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but has been left paralysed from the waist down after being shot. However, to the unbiased observer, the video of this incident seemed to show this wasn’t a case of an unjustified shooting. In the footage, which again sparked protests, Blake was seen walking around his car while officers had guns trained on him. He then proceeded to open the driver’s side front door and reach into the footwell, at which point, the arresting officer shot him in the back seven times. I’m not an American, but even I know that reaching into the footwell of your car while a US policeman has a gun pointed at you is a surefire way to get filled with lead. It later transpired that the police had been responding to a domestic violence complaint against Blake, who had an open warrant for sexual assault against his name. The police had already tasered him, but he’d got up again and walked to his car and was reaching for a knife in the footwell. Since Blake’s children were in the car, this story was spun as ‘evil cops shoot black father in front of his kids’, when, in reality, it ‘was alleged sex criminal shot reaching for weapon’. But no matter, the riots started again,NBA players threatened to go on strike, and it was held up as a further indictment of white supremacy in America. Never let facts get in the way of a good narrative. However, the latest case really takes the cake. There is currently unrest in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, after the police shot a man who was charging at them with a weapon. Officers had been called to a domestic disturbance, when knife-wielding Ricardo Munoz ran at them, brandishing the blade, and was clearly about to try to stab them. Bodycam footage shows Munoz jumping at an officer with the knife raised, and then being shot and killed. Following news of the shooting, hundreds of people took to the streets of Lancaster and the inevitable protests began. Misinformation was spread wildly on social media, with some people apparently believing the 27-year-old Munoz was an autistic 14-year-old who had been shot by the police. Munoz is also in the process of having his race revised from Latino to black to better suit the narrative. Protester outside#LancasterPApolice station still believes that victim of police involved shooting was 14 years old and not 28, despite reports claiming otherwise. At least they are now admitting that he did have a knife.#LancasterProtestpic.twitter.com/Lv7yoz2iaV Lancaster, PA: police summarily executed a reportedly autistic man they claim was armed with a knifeThey left his dead body ""visible on the ground for more than two hours""Protests are amping up in real-time...13 September 2020 PMhttps://t.co/klOKdjNQUL Police killed an Autistic boy in Lancaster PA What do these protesters want? It’s one thing to criticise police for racial profiling or excessive force when a perpetrator isn’t resisting arrest, but to argue that officers aren’t justified in using lethal force when a crazed knifeman is charging at them is ridiculous. Policing, particularly in a country with such a heavily armed citizenry, is a difficult and dangerous job. This doesn’t mean the police shouldn’t be held to account when they overreact or break the law. Obviously they should. But protesting such an obviously justified shooting as that of Munoz just shows that these leftist groups have no interest in real reform – they simply want to cause trouble. Their rhetoric has led to millions of dollars’ worth of damage in cities across America. The unrest caused by their rioting has resulted in multiple deaths, including those of teenagers. This latest unrest in Lancaster marks a new low for blacklivesmatter and Antifa, but I no longer believe they care about winning people over to their cause. They just want to watch America burn.

"14 Sep, 2020",Anti-racist activism risks own goals as sports fans tire of virtue signalling and constant badgering,"With the Premier League stepping away from its support of the blacklivesmatter campaign in favour of its own message on racism, people tired of the social justice crusaders will welcome a more relevant anti-racist approach. No one would ever have thought it would be the English Premier League that would finally get to grips with the anti-racism movement and show us all in the UK the way forward over the second-biggest issue of 2020. Because it seems football bosses finally woke up to the fact that blacklivesmatter in the UK is most definitely not part of the identically named US movement and that, if racism is going to be tackled effectively, then it is not by having quasi-paramilitary organisations like Forever Family Force or the Not F***ing Around Coalition marching on ourstreets. So off come the blacklivesmatter badges that were worn at the re-start of last season to be replaced by new sew-ons bearing the slogan No Room For Racism. It’s a more considered campaign specific to football and not just another flash foreignimport. It is a welcome change of approach for football fans who, frankly, just want to watch football, without posturing multi-millionaires virtue-signaling before and during each game. And it seems that it’s a sentiment shared elsewhere. In the States, as the NFL season kicked off Kansas City Chiefs players linking arms in a show of unity before their game against Houston Texans were booed by fans in thestadium. While some hand-wringers denounced the booing, one Kansas supporter pointed out what the display was actuallyabout:“Football fans are not booing racial equality and justice. They are booing the far left, abolish the nuclear family and capitalism rhetoric that has been shoved down their throats for the past 5 months. We were already for unity.” Articulate, those Chiefs fans. And also fed up with the tedious righteousness of the social justice warriors which has driven NFL teams to all sorts of responses: kneeling during the Star Spangled Banner, adding another song to the pre-match build-up – the Black anthem Lift Every Voice and Sing – staying in the dressing room until the game actually starts, linking arms, not linking arms, bitching about who’s doing what and why. How individuals and teams choose to show, or not, their support for blacklivesmatter has become as divisive as racism itself. You can understand why people have become bored with it all. But it’s time someone stood up for those who are sick of being lectured, bullied and accused of all sorts of things, because, while they may not be racists, they just aren’t declaring that fact loudly from the rooftops as the woke brigade insists. As far as this brigade is concerned, if you aren’t wearing t-shirts calling for justice for any number of individuals who have died at the hands of the police in a country on the other side of the Atlantic, then you are a racist. Ordinary folk have had enough of that simplistic, infantile idiocy. So if England, Pakistan and Australia cricketteamsdon’t want to take the knee before their games, then fine. If British rugby teams are told they can show their support in whatever way they please, then that’s good too. And if Monte Carlo millionaire Lewis Hamiltonwantsto fight for justice from his Formula One podium and US Open champ Naomi Osakawantsto politicise her Covid-19 protective face mask with names of dead black people then that’s all good too. Just don’t ask the rest of us to continually validate your political decisions, because that’s not the reason we buy tickets to watch you perform. We buy them so you can thrill with those skills that have taken you to the very top in international competitive sport. If you’re not going to entertain us, we’ll go somewhere else where we are not badgered about social justice or pet causes or face constant demands that we check our consciences. For many people those annoyances have now become repetitive and boring which is actually counter-productive to the cause you so earnestly seek to promote. So, please, we hear what you’re saying, take our word for it, we’re all on side. The protests have worked and things will change. Now. Just. Stop. Think your friends would be interested?

"13 Sep, 2020",‘We HOPE THEY DIE’: Blocking emergency room and wishing death on ambushed officers may be final straw in blacklivesmatter ’s PR suicide," blacklivesmatter may finally have found its bridge too far – the point of absurdity and overreaching vileness that finally destroys support for the “Marxist” political movement in all but the most extreme reaches of the left. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. blacklivesmatter has offered up many self-fails in recent weeks, the sort of anecdotes that stick in the minds of observers and turn the tide of public opinion against a cause that millions of Americans were eager to support initially. Even more than the group’s nonsensical demands -- such as defunding police departments and“remaking”the US political system – its tactics are making it impossible for politically independent Americans to support. Those tactics have included spreading false rumors about an Aug. 10 police shooting in Chicago, then racing downtown to loot the city’s most posh retailers, then defending the theft as“reparations.”Then there was the mob attack on a white motorist in Portland, who was pulled from his truck andbrutally beatenbefore being left motionless in the street, and the torching of black-owned businesses around the nation. Update: The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation.pic.twitter.com/cBQjyKkoxJ Other incidents have brought the senselessness closer to home for many Americans, such as the blacklivesmatter groups that marched through residential streets of such cities as Seattle and Portland late at night, threatening homeowners and chanting such messages as,“Wake up, wake up, wake up motherf***er, wake up.”Other blacklivesmatter mobs have descended on outdoor restaurants from Washington to Rochester, New York, screaming at diners and demanding displays of obedient solidarity, such as raising a fist. But Saturday night’s blacklivesmatter debaclewas the clincher, as protesters blocked the emergency room entrance and exit at a Los Angeles hospital after two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and shot repeatedly in their parked patrol car for no apparent reason. The protesters blocked the ER while yelling“We hope they die,”prompting the Sheriff’s Department to send out a tweet saying,“People’s lives are at stake when ambulances can’t get through.” To the protesters blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling ""We hope they die"" referring to 2 LA Sheriff s ambushed today in#Compton: DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES & EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL. People s lives are at stake when ambulances can t get through. As if that wasn’t bad enough, as deputies tried to arrest a protester who refused to disperse, a reporter for government-funded National Public Radio interfered and had to be arrested, the Sheriff’s Department said. The reporter,Josie Huang, did not identify herself as a journalist and didn’t have any press credentials with her, the department said. Protesters taunted police outside the hospital, saying such things as, ""You re all f***ing dyingone by one."" A video on social media also showed a celebratory reaction at the scene of the shooting, where a smiling witness said repeatedly,“They just aired the police out, ni**a.” Here’s the reaction of an eyewitness to the ambush of two Deputies shot in the head in#Compton. The victims are in the background. No one is going to help them. Vote like your life depends on it.#BlueLivesMatterpic.twitter.com/tE8NH5YZvm Evidence of the damage that the anti-racism protest movement is doing to itself is showing up in polling, including President Donald Trump gaining ground on Democrat challenger Joe Biden in the presidential race. In Oregon, where violent protests have dragged on for more than 100 straight days, 66 percent of respondents in aDHM Researchpoll said they disapprove of the demonstrations. To put that in perspective, a Republican presidential candidate hasn t won in Oregon since 1984. Trump has had some success in painting Biden and other Democrats as enablers of rioting. The shifting political winds prompted CNN hostDon Lemonto sound an alarm late last month, saying Democrats were trying to ignore the problem and risked losing votes in November. Biden has tried to take a more strident tone against rioting since then and said Sunday that the Los Angeles shooting was“cold-blooded”and“unconscionable.”He said the shooter“must be brought to justice.”Trump took the excoriation further, saying that if the deputies die,“fast trial, death penalty for the killer – only way to stop this.” This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.https://t.co/330QfeIUGg Understanding that they’ll need strong voting support from people in the protest movement, Democrats are trying to walk a fine line between condemning rioters and condoning violence. Their hope is that the pieces can be picked up after the election. “I’m voting for the guy who knows how to restore justice and peace, not the guy who incites more violence,”financial adviserLili Balfoursaid on Twitter.“If Trump wins, we’ll be in a civil war for the next four years. I’m ready for peace and reconciliation.” I m old enough to remember when the news that two police officers were gunned down would lead to a vigil at the hospital, with people praying for their recovery.How did we get to this sickening moment when people are gathering at the hospital to pray for their death? Therefore Biden speaks out against shooting police, but he’s quiet about celebration of shooting police and wishing death upon them. But actions like what we witnessed Saturday night in Los Angeles are just too repugnant to look the other way. Americans who are asked to raise a fist in support of blacklivesmatter or vote for the demonstrators chosen candidate can’t help but cringe about the conduct of whom they’re standing with.

"13 Sep, 2020",The Left’s extreme behavior is solidifying support for Trump; it’s as if blacklivesmatter has been invented by the Republicans,"Many people who previously would have never considered voting for Donald Trump will now do so due to the excesses of the social justice brigade. The Left’s failure to understand basic human psychology could decide the election. ByDiana Bruk, a Russian-American journalist living in New York, who has written for The New York Times, The Paris Review, Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Elle, amongst other publications. I’ve always considered myself a soft Liberal. But the last few months have really brought out my conservative side, and I’m not the only one. I’ve recently spoken to several working class people who were told they were being laid off just before getting an email saying the company was looking to“diversify its staff,”and their responses were all the same:“F**k this, I’m voting for Trump.” One of my issues with social activism has always been that it centers around an idea and doesn’t take basic human psychology into account. I understand that racism in America exists and should be eradicated. I understand and agree with the fact that there should be more people of color in white collar positions. I also understand that white, working-class people have families to feed and bills to pay, and that the only natural response to being fired and replaced by a person of color is to vote for Trump as a means of revenge. I’m ashamed to say I’ve had to fight off the same thoughts in the last few weeks. I’m white and well-educated, so, by Liberal standards, I’m automatically privileged. But I don’t have family money to fall back on, and need and want to work. I used to get a decent amount of assignments and opportunities from a Facebook group for female writers, but, lately, every post says“BIPOC writers only.”Theoretically, I’m all for it. If I were lounging around daddy’s pool posting socially aware updates all day, I’d be even more for it. But I’m not and I also need to eat. Russian-American immigrants have been more pissed off than I’ve ever seen them lately, and I understand why. In addition to all of the usual issues, they have to deal with feeling like they’re black and white at the same time. To be light-skinned means getting fired or otherwise attacked for not being a person of color. But to have an accent and need to work to make a living makes you a minority. Social media makes it seem like everyone is either a ‘Karen’ or ‘Straight Outta Compton,’ but there’s a lot of in between, and those are the people who are being forgotten. And they’re the ones who vote. When I tell my social justice friends that there are a lot of working class white people who feel marginalized right now, their response is always the same:“Well, that’s how black people have felt for a long time.”I totally get that and I agree. But there’s a difference between justice and revenge. And it’s also an election year. The blacklivesmatter movement is important, but it’s so poorly timed that, were I a conspiracy theorist, I would say that the Republicans were behind it all along. So this is my message to all of my social justice friends: I know you mean well, but be smart about this. None of us wants Trump to get re-elected. We’re already stuck with Acceptable Under the Circumstances Joe Biden because of all of the in-fighting between Elizabeth Warren supporters and Bernie Sanders aficionados. You have to understand that being antagonistic is just going to make the Other Side feel defensive and lash out. This is, once again, basic human psychology, and it will not get you the results you want, and then you’re just going to whine and moan about it as usual. I saw a viral Simpsons clip recently that summed things up nicely. An elephant runs through the Republican National Convention, which has banners saying“We want what’s worst for everyone”and“We’re just plain evil.”Then it runs through a Democratic National Convention, which has banners saying“We can’t govern”and“We hate life and ourselves.”I get that you feel guilty for being white and wealthy and having a lot when others have so little. Recognize that, own it, and stop being so self-righteous about it. Recognize that posting hateful comments on the walls of people whose opinions differ from yours is cyber-bullying, which you are purportedly against. Recognize that hating on people who are having anxiety attacks over wearing masks and the general situation means bullying people with mental health issues, which you are also purportedly against. And recognize that if you are going to make large swaths of people feel attacked by Democrats, you are pushing them right into Trump’s stiff, unstable embrace. Think your friends would be interested?

"13 Sep, 2020","‘Pathetic, spineless, dumb’: Edinburgh University CANCELS dead genius David Hume","Edinburgh University has stripped David Hume’s name from one of its buildings, saying that the 18th century philosopher’s views on race caused “distress” to students. The university has been blasted for ‘cancelling’ a “genius.” Hume was one of the most important figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. An empiricist and student of human nature, he was a skeptic of organized religion, and his rejection of Christian miracles and the idea that the complexity of the world did not prove the existence of God made him a controversial figure in his day. Hume, however, is now the latest victim of ‘cancel culture.’ In aletterto students this weekend, Edinburgh University announced it would rename David Hume Tower as 40 George Square. The decision was made by a group of anti-racist committees, who concluded that Hume’s comments on race“rightly cause distress today.”The new name is temporary, and may become permanent after a review by the university. Prior to the renaming, studentspetitionedthe university to name the 14-storey building after Julius Nyerere, the first president of independent Tanzania and a graduate of the university. Though they decried Hume’s“racist epithets,”the effort to rename the tower after Nyerre ran into trouble when the students discovered the Tanzanian leader’s“ties to dictatorship”and“homophobia.” A testament to the insanity of our times that the University of Edinburgh takes issue with the NAME of David Hume Tower, and not the hideous structure itself.“40 George Square.” Lipstick on a pig!pic.twitter.com/k2xergZp92 On race, Hume’s views were typical of his time.“Negroes,”he wrote in a 1753 footnote to his essay ‘Of National Characters’, are“naturally inferior to the whites.”Furthermore, while Hume described slavery in 1739 as a condition that“exposes us to a thousand wants, and mortifications,”he advised his patron, Lord Hertford, in 1766 to buy a plantation in Grenada, and put up £400 of his own money toward the purchase. The links between Hume and slavery were dug up in 2014 by historian Felix Waldmann, who ironicallybenefitedfrom a Hume Fellowship at the university two years later. According to Waldmann, Hume was wealthy enough not to need income from the plantation, and should have recognized“the enormity of slavery.” Holding thinkers of the past to the standards of the present is a difficult task, when even Hollywoodmoviesfrom four decades ago no longer meet the morality standards of today. Indeed, most of the philosophers whose works underpin Western thought would be canceled in an instant if they were around in 2020. Aristotle saw some people“marked out for subjection”from the moment of birth, while Plato saw the“superior ruling over and having more than the inferior”as just. Later, the Christian theologists of the Middle Ages saw slavery as a natural condition, with Thomas Aquinas describing the master/slave relationship as one similar to that of a parent and child. What’s more, while the philosophy of personal liberty was developed in earnest during the Enlightenment, some of the era’s most prominent thinkers saw black people as naturally inferior to whites. Immanuel Kant, for example, once remarked that“this fellow was quite black...a clear proof that what he said was stupid.”The hierarchy of the races was accepted by many Enlightenment thinkers, with German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach’s1795description of the“Caucasian”as the world’s most advanced race treated as scientific fact at the time. Hume’s cancellation was met with disbelief online.“So much easier to symbolically flagellate dead 18th century geniuses than meaningfully work on structural issues now,”wrote University of Sussex philosophy professor Kathleen Stock, adding:“not sure they ve really thought this through.” David Hume tower to be renamed: ""the 18th century philosopher whose comments on matters of race, though not uncommon at the time, rightly cause distress today"". So much easier to symbolically flagellate dead 18th century geniuses than meaningfully work on structural issues nowhttps://t.co/CHDof9FJSM Edinburgh University has cancelled / deleted the great enlightenment philosopher David Hume.What a cowardly, stupid, craven, pathetic, spineless, dumb thing to do. Shame on them.https://t.co/3X6xBGu7pg I’m not even sure there was really a *major* push to get Edinburgh University to bin David Hume & yet they have done so anyway. There is a performative quality to this; a kind of cry for attention. That it makes them a laughing-stock hardly matters. “The simple answer,”Jonathan Hearn, a sociology professor at Edinburgh University, wrote in hisblog,“is that we judge people, including intellectuals like Hume, in the round, on their general contributions and accomplishments, not by seeking out any failing we can find and focussing all our attention on that.” Edinburgh University is not unique in its desire to purge itself of any connection to racism, especially not in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in the US this summer. In just one example from the US, activistsdemandedHarvard University rename its Board of Overseers, on account of the word ‘overseer’ having a connection to plantation slavery. In the UK, the Natural History Museum hasmulledremoving its Charles Darwin exhibits, citing his“colonialist scientific expeditions.”On campus though, efforts to sanitize history predate the current blacklivesmatter protests, with Oxford studentsdemandingthe removal of a statue honoring colonialist Cecil Rhodes as far back as 2015, and Liverpool students demanding former Prime Minister William Gladstone’s name beremovedfrom a residence hall, claiming he didn’t fight slavery hard enough.

"13 Sep, 2020",Bernie Sanders warns Joe Biden: Pull left or blow the election,"President Trump has accused Joe Biden of being a puppet of the “radical left.” But the US’ most prominent leftist, Bernie Sanders thinks Biden isn’t leaning left enough. His concerns seem to be falling on deaf ears, though. Trump has said that Joe Biden, a centrist democrat with nearly five decades of experience in Washington, is a“puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life.”Central to Trump’s argument is Biden’s refusal to strongly condemn the wave of violence that’s accompanied ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests, as well as his pledge to roll back Trump’s tax cuts should he win in November. To Bernie Sanders, however, Biden is sticking too close to the center for his own good. According to a Washington Post report on Sunday, Sanders“told associates that Biden is at serious risk of coming up short in the November election if he continues his vaguer, more centrist approach.” That approach has seen Biden focus his campaign almost entirely around opposition to Trump, rather than the“economic populism”that made Sanders a hit with young voters during this year’s primary season. According to the report, Sanders wants Biden to embrace single-payer healthcare and higher wages, and to unveil plans to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Furthermore, Sanders reportedly wants Biden to campaign with popular leftist politicians like New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in a bid to reach young and Latino voters, the latter of whom areleaning moreand more toward Trump as election day draws nearer. Ocasio-Cortez was a late addition to the speakers’ roster at last month’s Democratic National Committee, and in a move perhaps indicative of the party’s dedication to Biden-style centrism, was afforded less time to speak than Republican former governor John Kasich. Sanders’ decision to back Biden came as a disappointment to his legions of supporters, who saw the socialist senator’s endorsement as a capitulation to the same machine politics that forced him out of contention against Hillary Clinton in 2016. In response, Sanders promised that he’d pull Biden to the left, and both men set up a number of task forces to shape policy on climate change, immigration, healthcare, and a number of other hot-button progressive issues. Yet the task forcessettledthis summer on expanding Obamacare rather than implementing Sanders’ signature ‘Medicare for All’ system. The climate recommendations fell short of the radical ‘Green New Deal’ some progressives demanded, and the criminal justice reforms outlined did not mention defunding police departments, a core demand of some leftists and ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ activists. Even in announcing the task force’s recommendations, Sanders admitted that himself and Biden had“strong disagreements about some of the most important issues facing our country.” His pleas to Biden have only intensified since then.“You got to give people an alternative or reason to vote for you other than saying, ‘I’m not Donald Trump,’”Sanders said in a PBS interview on Friday.“And that means speaking about an economic program, which Biden has. It is not as strong as I would like it. It is not the Bernie Sanders program.” If there’s anything Sanders should be used to by now, it’s being sidelined by the Democratic establishment. Despite Hillary Clinton’srecord lowfavorability ahead of the party’s 2016 convention, Sanders wasmuscled outby a party whose staff werehand-pickedby the Clinton camp, and went on to endorse Clinton, a move many of his supporters saw as a betrayal of his values. This time around, the bias against Bernie began in primary season, with leaked stories of Sanders’ so-calledRussian supportcirculating in the media in February, and liberal punditscomparingthe avowed socialist to Adolf Hitler. Bernie Sanders, the Washington Post declared in one of its ten anti-Sandersop-edsin less than a month, is“the Donald Trump of the left.” Yet Sanders has hitched his wagon to the democraticparty , and when push comes to shove will choose Biden over his own progressive ideology. Speaking to PBS on Friday, he said his own disagreements with Biden came second to their common goal:“to defeat Trump.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"11 Sep, 2020","Here s why ‘Frankenstein’ Trump will probably win in November, and the aloof global elites will only have themselves to blame","The populist Republican is a formidable candidate in today’s political culture, while the Democrats are scuppering themselves with their hatred of ‘Middle America’, their support for blacklivesmatter and their general ineptitude. ByGraham Hryce, an Australian journalist and former media lawyer, whose work has been published in The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Sunday Mail, the Spectator and Quadrant. Donald Trump can win this year’s presidential election because he is, in effect, the political Frankenstein monster created by the globalized elites who now completely dominate the democraticparty . Just as the central character of Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel was a projection of elite fear of the rise of the industrial working class, so too is Trump the archetypal “deplorable” to be feared and destroyed. With one important difference. Unlike Dr Frankenstein’s monster, Trump is not a fictional character. He is a very real and, notwithstanding his obvious and many flaws, extremely effective politician. Just as surely as Dr Frankenstein created his monster, so too did America’s globalized elites create the current President. Trump did not create the 1980s greed-based capitalism that allowed him to amass his fortune. Nor did he create the mindless celebrity culture that thrust him into media prominence, and has now fatally infected American politics. Nor did Trump create the post-truth intellectual climate and culture of narcissism that nourish him and permit him to succeed beyond his own expectations. All of these fundamental economic and cultural changes are the handiwork of the globalized elites that now dominate politics, universities, large corporations, bureaucracies and large sections of the media in America. More importantly, they have completely taken over the democraticparty in the last 20 years. Trump’s populist politics oppose the ideologies of the globalized elites (identity politics, catastrophic climate change, political correctness etc) and appeal to those groups that have been left behind by the globalization of the American economy and the ideological rule of the new elites. It was these groups – so-called ‘Middle America’– who elected Trump in 2016, and they will again play a decisive role in this year’s election. Neither Trump nor Joe Biden can become president without a large measure of their support. Given his appalling mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his refusal to even acknowledge the racial tensions dividing America, Trump’s chances of being re-elected should be slim. (Having said that, it is important to note that America’s race problem existed long before Trump, and that Barack Obama, during the eight years of his presidency, did absolutely nothing to alleviate it). The fact that Trump has a good chance of being re-elected – recent polls suggest that the gap between him and Biden is closing – is in large part due to the Democrats’ inability to deal with Trump personally or to effectively appeal to Middle America. Trump is not a traditional politician, and he operates within a political culture that is qualitatively different from that which existed even 20 years ago. American politics today is characterized by furious ideological division, the demonizing and delegitimizing of opponents, and the absence of rational public debate. Anti-intellectualism is the norm, and celebrity status is more important than policy coherence. The appearance of strength is a politician’s most important asset these days. Contemporary American politics is fundamentally and irredeemably irrational. Commentators such as Walter Lippmann pointed out the irrational nature of American politics in the 1920s, but the degree of irrationality has increased exponentially since then. Within such a political framework, Trump is a formidable politician. His victory in 2016, which was no aberration, should have made this clear. Democrat opponents of Trump, however, continue to ignore the changed nature of contemporary American politics and, as a result, seriously underestimate Trump’s political effectiveness. This was the case with Hilary Clinton in 2016, and Biden appears to be making the same mistake. Biden treats Trump as if he is a reincarnation of Ronald Reagan. He keeps trying to engage Trump in rational policy debates, and even when he justifiably attacks Trump on policy grounds, his attacks fail to resonate. When Biden criticizes Trump for being politically incorrect, the attacks are even more ineffective. There is only one way to deal effectively with Trump, and that is to dominate him by sheer force of personality. Biden is clearly not up to this, and neither were any of the other Democrat nominees (except, perhaps, for Kamala Harris). But the Democrats’ political strategy, in any event, eschews such a Trump-like approach. Not only is Biden incapable of dealing with Trump personally, but there is a distinct possibility that Trump will destroy him during the three scheduled pre-electiondebates. Much will depend on the format of the debates, but Trump excels in face-to-face confrontations with people he can dominate – and the gaffe-prone Biden will be particularly vulnerable in such a setting. As to the Democrats’ failure to appeal to Middle America, three issues are particularly relevant here. First, the unprincipled attempted impeachment of Trump, which failed completely (as it was always going to). The Democrats got down in the gutter with Trump, but he beat them comprehensively at his own game. Allied to this is the never-ending media campaign to discredit Trump over trivial issues and alleged breaches of political correctness. Such tactics are fundamentally misguided and counter-productive. Second, the Democrats enthusiastic support for the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protests and their failure to rigorously condemn the ongoing mindless violence associated with them. This is a serious political error, which will cost Biden crucial votes – and it has enabled Trump, with a degree of justification, to pose as the defender of law and order and to accuse Biden of wanting to destroy America. And third, the refusal by the Democrats to make any ideological concessions whatsoever in respect of identity politics or political correctness. The fact that Biden chose Harris as his running mate only because she was black and a woman says it all. The globalized elites despise Middle America and its values, and the current Democrat leadership (just like Hilary Clinton) is incapable of hiding it – even if it is in their political interests to do so. Readers of Shelley’s novel will recall that, at the end of the book, Dr Frankenstein is dead and the still-alive monster is last seen drifting towards the horizon clinging to an iceberg. The presidential election in November will no doubt conclude somewhat differently – although the novel’s ending may yet prove vaguely prescient. In any event, the fact that Trump still has a good chance of being re-elected says a great deal more about the ideological blindness and political ineptitude of Biden and the democraticparty than it does about Trump.

"10 Sep, 2020",Time to inhale: Democrats seek to gain an electoral high in the US presidential race by legalizing cannabis,"A bill allowing the use of marijuana is due to be voted into law later this month. Democrats hope the move – backed by VP candidate Kamala Harris – will boost their support in November’s election. But might the gamble backfire? ByKen Silverstein, award-winning columnist who has covered energy and the environment for more than two decades. Follow him@Ken_Silverstein The pursuit of marijuana legalization will hit a new high this month, when the Democrat-controlled US House of Representatives is expected to give it a thumbs up. The bill – sponsored in the Senate by the party’s vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris – removes marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances, which has prevented aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the finance they need to grow cannabis businesses. Supporters say it is also about racial justice – according to the American Civil Liberties Union, black people are 3.6 times more likely to getarrestedfor possessing pot than white people – and fits in nicely with their backing for the blacklivesmatter movement. “Marijuana laws are enforced more heavily on people of color and disenfranchised communities,” said Morgan Fox, spokesman for the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), in an interview with RT. “The bill would change federal law. But the vast majority of arrests are taking place at the state and local levels.” Beyond legalizing pot, the MORE act would also make it easier to expunge arrests for marijuana possession as well as any past criminal convictions. That eases the path to a college education and to finding a job and getting housing. Democrats calculate that legalizing cannabis is a political winner and something that promotes equal justice and economic opportunity. By removing federal penalties, there will be fewer arrests and a better chance for many to succeed in life – especially in an industry that will reinvest much of its profits into communities devastated by the war on drugs. It’s all a far cry from the time back in 1992 when the then Democratic presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, infamously admitted to having “experimented with marijuana” once or twice but added, “I didn’t inhale it.” The comedian Johnny Carson later quipped: “That’s the trouble with the Democrats. Even when they do something wrong, they don’t do it right.” These days, such wimpiness about smoking a spliff might do a candidate more harm than good. A 2019 Galluppollfound that 66 percent of Americans support legalization of the drug, including three-quarters of Democrats and about half of all Republicans. Which is a big turnaround in sentiment: back in 1969, when Gallup first asked the question, just 12% were in favor. So what implications might this all have on the presidential race this November? Most senior Democrats clearly feel it can be a vote-winning position, but others – including Joe Biden – are a little more wary. The presidential candidate opposes outright legalization, although he supports decriminalization and the use of marijuana for medical purposes. His position may be a result of his son Hunter’s battles with cocaine, and a fear that cannabis use can lead to the use of more dangerous drugs. NCIA spokesman Fox says that the so-called “gateway” link between marijuana and more addictive drugs has been debunked, and that legalization would ensure users would buy from well-regulated stores – not from drug dealers trying to up-sell them. He believes Biden, if elected, would eventually back the bill. “Regardless of Biden’s position, Senator Harris is the lead sponsor, and it is unlikely that Biden would stand in the way of more comprehensive legislation,” he said. “This issue is more popular than any politician, and one that could swing this election.” But others believe that the push might muddle the Democrats’ message with just weeks to go before Election Day. “You re harming your ability to defeat Donald Trump,” Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research, toldPolitico. “He and his Republican allies get to say, ‘See, Joe Biden s not going to be in control. Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are in control.’” So, what might President Trump do? He has opposed legalization, but he is also a political opportunist who may be tempted to jump in ahead of the 66 percent who favor legalization. He also understands business – and cannabis is rapidly becoming big business. Fourteen states have so far legalized recreational use, while a further 33 have done so for medical purposes, and marijuana legalization is on the ballot in five states this November – measures that range from allowing adult use to permitting it for medical purposes. Marijuana Biz Daily says thatretail salesof the drug in the US will be $15 billion this year – and will rise as high as $37 billion by 2023. The number working full time in the industry is likely to hit 385,000 next year. Colorado, the first state to legalize marijuana in 2014, now gets $1 billion of its $30 billion budget fromthe cannabis industry. It has almost 3,000 licensed marijuana businesses, who employ more than 41,000 people. Marijuana-related tourism is one of the big hits, with cannabistours, wellness retreats, cooking classes and private smoking lounges catering to out-of-state visitors. Around 25% of people who traveled to Colorado between 2013 and 2018 listed cannabis as one of the reasons they chose to visit the state. The state, furthermore, had a 2.5 percent unemployment rate before Covid-19 hit. All of which adds up to the sort of economic boost both presidential candidates would dearly love. Like this story?

"7 Sep, 2020",NFL s big kickoff: Five things to look out for as COVID-hit season gets underway,"One of the most unique NFL seasons in recent memory begins this week as the league s 32 teams take to the field amid uncertainties about how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact the sport in the coming months. Even the most seasoned NFL experts will tell you that there are more than a few question marks ahead of the 2020 season. The specter of the ongoing global health crisis has made an indelible mark on most major sports across the globe and, of course, the National Football League has not been immune. The worldwide sporting shutdown has severely restricted teams abilities to effectively prepare. Practice times have been reduced, team activities that traditionally take place in person were instead conducted over Zoom calls, and multi-million dollar training facilities sat empty, with players instead attempting to physically prepare themselves in home-made gyms in their garages. So, how will these limitations impact the forthcoming season, and what else should we look out for when the season gets up and running this week? With each team scrambling to ready themselves amid much-reduced training times, this will likely result in a spate of errors as players work their way to full game fitness. You can expect to see more than a few blown plays as players – and in particular rookies – grapple with their playbooks. Furthermore, tackling technique – which is often an issue early on in NFL campaigns – will almost certainly be lacking among some players, so look for the league s more experienced running backs to rack up some lengthy runs and take advantage of any uncertainty in opposition defensive schemes. Conversely, if this season will present challenges to the league s younger players, some of the veterans – the so-called plug n play players – will rely upon their wealth of experience to identify holes. Essentially, teams who rely on tactical schemes (hello, Bill Belichick) could struggle early, while others with dependable veterans adept at reading the game will likely take advantage of any second-guessing among the opposition. A post shared by NFL (@nfl)onSep 6, 2020 at 12:17pm PDT Dozens of NFL players have already opted out of the forthcoming season due to the potential risk of the virus, with most citing concerns about the health of their families – especially those with newborn children. Each team in the league locked in their 53-man roster this past Saturday, but you can be sure that these rosters will be chopped and changed if and when players in the league test positive for the virus and undergo enforced quarantine periods. One suspects that more than a few headlines will be generated should some of the league s standout teams be forced to play without a host of recognized stars - and things could get even worse if there is a localized outbreak within a team s training facility. And we can only imagine the havoc this will play with fans Fantasy Football teams! A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)onJul 30, 2020 at 6:06am PDT There was considerable angst in New England this year when Tom Brady confirmed that he was ending his two-decade association with the Patriots, placing a bookend on the most storied quarterback career in history. Brady s famous #12 shirt now comes in the black and red of the Buccaneers, where famed coach Bruce Arians looks to harness the gas left in the 43-year-old veteran s tank to propel the underperforming Florida team towards the playoffs. Brady has been joined in Tampa by his old New England cohort Rob Gronkowski, while veteran running back (and recent addition) LeSean McCoy was also joined by former first-round pick Leonard Fournette. The new Tampa Bay roster now reads like an all-star roster and this certainly would have been an incredible assembly of talent five years ago. But in 2020? The jury remains firmly out. A post shared by Nick Chubb (@nchubb27)onDec 5, 2019 at 5:33pm PST If Brady is in the twilight of his career, space exists for someone to step out of the shadow to be regarded as the best arm in the league. Last year s MVP Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens and the Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes, who recently inked a mammoth $503 million contract, look set to be the two quarterbacks who will duel with each another for the next decade or more. Elsewhere, young talent like New York s Saquon Barkley, Cleveland s Nick Chubb (and a host of others) look set for breakout seasons where they will hope to take further steps towards a Super Bowl and eventually Hall of Fame status. Given that a large amount of the ongoing "" blacklivesmatter "" protests found its genesis when former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to kneel during the national anthem three years ago, you can be sure that the current social malcontent in the United States will continue to be referenced on NFL sidelines. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has already given his blessing to players peacefully protesting at games (much to the chagrin of Donald Trump) and this will almost certainly continue to be a divisive issue among sections of the viewing public.

"6 Sep, 2020",Trump warns that schools implementing 1619 Project’s America ‘founded on racism’ teachings will lose funding,"President Trump has said the Department of Education is investigating schools that implement the New York Times’ 1619 Project, which teaches that America was founded on racism, and those institutions could lose federal funding. Trump made his declaration in a Sunday tweet, responding to a message claiming that California schools have begun teaching the 1619 curriculum. “Department of Education is looking at this. If so, they will not be funded!”he tweeted. Department of Education is looking at this. If so, they will not be funded!https://t.co/dHsw6Y6Y3M The 1619 Project has inspired heated debate about American history and how it is viewed. It is based on a series of essays from the New York Times Magazine that claims US history began in 1619 – the year recognized as that when the first African slaves arrived in Virginia. The Project also claims capitalism was founded on slavery and black people have contributed more to democracy than white people. Several schooldistrictsacross the country have adopted the 1619 Project into their curriculum. Republicans have been staunchly opposed to schools using this as a basis for how they teach American history. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) even introduced a bill in July that would strip funding from schools that use the 1619 Project as part of their curriculum. The NYT s 1619 Project is a racially divisive, revisionist account of history that denies the noble principles of freedom & equality on which our nation was founded. Federal funding shouldn t help indoctrinate young Americans w/ this left-wing garbage.https://t.co/YmWD0xOC8z The project was awarded the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, but it has been disputed and slammed by critics as inaccurate and agenda-driven for its more outlandish takes on history, such as the claim the American Revolutionary War was fought partly to preserve slavery in the US. Still, the project has plenty of support on the left, and Trump’s declaration has only inflamed those supporters, and the project s leader, on social media. Do those concerns about cancel culture and McCarthyism and censorship only apply to the left or do they apply to the POTUS threatening to investigate schools for teaching American journalism? Silence is deafening here.#1619Projecthttps://t.co/rrRf8rLdZ0 I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. Removing statues of glorified slave owners: Erasing history.Teach the 1619 Project in schools because it’s what ACTUALLY happened: Defund the schools. How does teaching ACTUAL American history make it unrecognizable?pic.twitter.com/x4OtPG6I8E The president’s 1619 tweet was posted after he directed the Office of Management and Budget to crack down on federal agencies teaching racial sensitivity training related to“white privilege”and“critical race theory,”which was blasted in a Fridaymemoas“anti-American propaganda.” If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"6 Sep, 2020","Black militia, armed ‘Patriots’ & blacklivesmatter protesters face off in Louisville on chaotic Kentucky Derby day (VIDEOS)","Hundreds of protesters from rival groups have descended on Louisville, with armed pro-police activists facing off with anti-racism protesters, as members of all-black NFAC militia staged yet another demonstration of force. Dressed in black combat fatigues and carrying rifles, around 200 members of the Not F**king Around Coalition (NFAC) gathered in Louisville on Saturday.

"3 Sep, 2020","Biden follows Trump to Kenosha, meets with Jacob Blake’s family despite father’s anti-Semitic posts surfacing","Days after President Donald Trump visited Kenosha, Wisconsin the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is doing the same. The ‘healing’ visit started with meeting the family of Jacob Blake, including his controversial father. Ahead of the visit on Thursday, Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris released a TV ad promising to impose a nationwide standard for police use of force and declaring that“now is the time for racial justice.” New: Biden, Harris unveil new we re listening ad focused on racial injustice and policing, hours before Kenosha trip where he will meet with the family of Jacob Blake.https://t.co/cPUIyCRNGDpic.twitter.com/7Bd44DE2YD Biden has also called for criminal charges against the police officer who shot Blake, a 29-year-old African-American man who was shot seven times late last month. Blake was reportedly armed with a knife and had shrugged off a taser. He survived the shooting, but the Wisconsin city was rocked by several nights of violent riots in the aftermath. Trump had visited Kenosha on Tuesday, meeting with law enforcement and pledging almost $4 million to businesses that were looted or set on fire. While he prayed with Blake’s mother’s pastor, the president chose not to meet with the family. Biden, on the other hand, made Blake’s family a centerpiece of his visit, meeting them privately at the Milwaukee airport before proceeding into town. NEWS:@JoeBidenand@DrBidenare meeting with the family of Jacob Blake now at the Milwaukee AirportList of attendees via the Biden campaignpic.twitter.com/v2cfcXkeaA While Blake’s mother spoke by phone, his father Jacob Blake Sr. was there in person – even after conservative media outlets dug up a sizable amount of his sordid social media posts, includinghighly offensiveanti-Semitic and anti-Christian statements.. The revelation has not tempered Democrats’ efforts to portray Biden’s visit as totally different from Trump’s,sayingthat the former VP is coming with“compassion, a desire to heal, and a fire extinguisher”to Trump’s“matches and kerosene.”Biden would provide“the selfless leadership and constructive voice we have sorely missed for almost 4 years,”is how former Obama aide David Plouffeput it. The reception in Kenosha certainly seemed different. While Trump’s visit drew crowds of both supporters and protesters, Biden’s visit seemed to have attracted only the media, with locals apparently conspicuously absent. A different angle. There are no Biden supporters in sight. Only Media. Where is the support for Biden?

"2 Sep, 2020",Biden campaign tries to seize ‘law and order’ message from Trump with new ad condemning rioting,"With violent protests and riots chipping away at his poll numbers, Joe Biden has released a new ad condemning looting and “lawlessness.” His ad comes as the Trump campaign gears up to push similar but more extreme TV messages. Since the killing of George Floyd in May triggered a summer of nationwide protests and riots, President Donald Trump has savaged Democrat mayors and governors for not cracking down hard enough on criminality, and roasted Joe Biden for his reluctance to condemn the violence strongly enough. With reaction among Washington Democrats ranging from denial (Rep. Jerry Nadlercalledstreet violence in Portland a“myth,”for example) to outrightencouragement, the riots finally appear to havehurtBiden’s polling, narrowing the gap between the former vice president and Trump to single digits. Biden has now switched tack. In a campaign video released on Tuesday, the presidential hopeful declares that“Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple.”Biden accuses Trump of“fanning the flames”of violence, his supporters of“acting as an armed militia,”and his“divisive”rhetoric of instilling“fear in America.” The ad does not directly call out the violence of Antifa rioters or blacklivesmatter supporters. Trump’s often-armed supporters, like those who turned up and faced off against rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin – claiming they were there to protect property –  are the only group of citizens criticized for violence. Nevertheless it is the strongest ‘law and order’ statement from Biden to date. It will be aired in key battleground states this month as part of a $53 million TV spending push. The Trump campaign has spent a similar amount of cash, with around $49 million worth of TV airtime booked for September, according to a recent CNN report. Trump’s latest ads hit the airwaves on Wednesday. One ad, which will air in the riot-hit state of Wisconsin, paints Biden’s response to the riots as weak, taking a knee in support of blacklivesmatter while“lawless criminals terrorize Kenosha.”A similar ad focuses on Minneapolis, where rioting first kicked off in May. Trump, by contrast, is portrayed as a“strong”leader, whose mobilization of federal resources in Wisconsin and Minnesota saved these Democrat-run states from further anarchy. Anotheradset to air in a number of battleground states accuses Democrats of“fanning the flames of lawlessness,”while portraying Trump as the guardian of America’s“hopes and values and faith.” According to an NBC poll released in mid-August, Trump leads Biden 43-39 percent on fighting crime, though it is still unknown how the destruction of Kenosha may have changed that figure. In a visit to the Kenosha on Tuesday, Trump kept his rhetoric strong, standing amid the ruins of the city’s businesses, the president called the recent spate of riots“domestic terrorism,”and pledged his support to the nation’s law enforcement. Biden will visit Kenosha on Thursday, though he is unlikely to directly ape Trump’s unequivocal pro-law enforcement stance. Instead, his campaign said that he will“hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.” Think your friends would be interested?

"2 Sep, 2020","In dramatic U-turn after public anger, BBC says patriotic anthems WILL be sung at Proms but by ‘select singers’","Anthems ‘Rule Britannia!’ and ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ will still be sung at this year’s edition of BBC Proms, the broadcaster revealed after it faced an avalanche of criticism over the decision to play them without lyrics. The BBC previously made headlines nationwide after it announced the two anthems – which historically caused controversy because of their perceived association with colonialism and slavery – will feature as“new orchestral versions”in the 2020 concert. The decision was explained by the existing coronavirus restrictions as chorus singers couldn’t be safely gathered at the Royal Albert Hall, where the Last Night of the Proms takes place annually. The Proms are among the oldest yearly performances of classical music in the UK, culminating with the Last Night, a concert leaning toward popular numbers. An unwavering feature of this part are the British national anthem and other patriotic songs. Some previous media reports suggested the traditional songs would be possibly dropped as organizers felt the lyrics of ‘Rule Britannia!’ and ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ would be an affront to blacklivesmatter protests spreading in both America and Europe. Conservative voices – among them 10 Downing Street and prominent government figures – met the news with shock and outrage. On social media, viewers and observers accused the broadcaster of being utterly out of touch with millions of license-fee paying Britons. On Wednesday, the BBC made a remarkable change of mind, saying“we have been looking hard at what else might be possible and we have a solution.” Both pieces will be performed by“a select group of BBC singers.”This would mean the words“will be sung in the hall, and as we have always made clear,”it said in an announcement, inviting audiences to“sing along at home.“ Think your friends would be interested?

"1 Sep, 2020","400,000+ Americans sick of political duopoly turn out for virtual ‘People’s Convention’ & vote to launch new anti-corporate party","Fed up with decades of two-party rule, hundreds of thousands of Americans tuned in for the People’s Convention, where they voted to form a new political alternative unbeholden to corporate power or the military-industrial complex. The event drewmore than 400,000 viewersto its livestream on Sunday, organizers said. It continued to trend on Twitter through more than 5 hours of speeches that culminated in a vote to create a“major new corporate-free political party in America.” Among the speakers at the convention were several disgruntled Democrats, from Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2020 national co-chair Nina Turner to a candidate in this year’s primaries, Marianne Williamson. The roster of speakers also included former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, comedian Jimmy Dore, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges, who summed up the spirit of the convention in a fiery address. “There is only one choice in this election, and that is the consolidation of oligarchic power under Donald Trump, or the consolidation of oligarchic power under Joe Biden,”said Hedges, who also hosts RT s On Contact. “The oligarchs with Trump or Biden will win again, and we will lose.” Only one thing matters to the oligarchs, it is not democracy, it is not truth, it is not the consent of the governed, it is not income inequality, it is not the surveillance state, it is not endless war… it is the primacy of corporate power, which has extinguished our democracy and left most of the working class and the working poor in misery. The People’s Convention was held on the heels of the Republican and Democratic national conventions earlier this month, which event organizers said“erased the needs of poor and working people in a time of mounting national crisis.”It ended with a vote to create the People’s Party in 2021, in which some 99 percent of its 400,000 viewers took part. Williamson, who made an unsuccessful bid for Democratic nominee in the 2020 race, slammed an economic system that for decades has stranded“millions of people without even a life vest,”concentrating massive amounts of wealth upward and leaving the American middle class“completely devastated.” We have reverted to aristocracy; it is now a corporate aristocracy. “It is health insurance companies, it is big pharmaceutical companies, it is big oil, it is food companies… and of course, it is the military industrial complex,”she said. A former Ohio state senator and a senior figure in the Sanders campaign, Turner told the convention that“we are in a fight for our lives and for future generations,”adding“We don’t believe in the lies and the bribes and the contentment in a lousy peace,”quoting from a 1938 poem by Langston Hughs. “How can we have peace in moments like this, when over 90 million of our sisters and brothers are either uninsured or underinsured?”Turner asked.“How can we have peace when on the streets of America right now, black lives have been reaching out, calling out the racism and the white supremacy and the bigotry of a system that was created for black lives to languish.” How can we have peace when you got a Congress that goes on recess while millions of people are facing evictions from their homes? “We need a third or fourth entity to step in. The lesser of two evils is still evil,”said Ventura, who was elected Minnesota governor on a third-party ticket in 1998 and has since been involved with the Libertarian and Green parties. Ventura has also hosted RT’s ‘Off the Grid’ (ending in 2015) and ‘The World According to Jesse.’ Harvard professor and social critic Dr. Cornel West also addressed the event, calling to“transform the American empire into a more democratic space,”while dubbing the two major parties the“neo-fascist”and“neo-liberal”wings of the“ruling class.” “We are living in a moment of massive imperial meltdown, spiritual breakdown, and we need prophetic fight-back,”West said, arguing the new party would provide just that. The Movement for a People’s Party, the organization behind the project, now says it is working to establish local branches around the US, which will“form the building blocks of state parties”and work through the long and often arduous process of securing ballot access. The group has set a lofty goal for the new anti-corporate outfit, hoping it will be“poised to sweep Congress and the White House”by the next election cycle in 2024.

"31 Aug, 2020",‘Blackmail Americans into voting’: Biden condemns riots & violence in language Trump supporters say amounts to extortion,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has finally spoken up against the riots and looting occurring across the US, blaming President Donald Trump. A poorly worded tweet has seen Biden’s critics accuse the ex-VP of blackmail. “Rioting is not protesting,”Biden said during a speech in Pennsylvania on Monday.“It’s lawlessness, plain and simple... Violence will not bring change.” The Democratic nominee’s remarks come shortly after a Trump supporter wasgunned downin Portland, Oregon and almost a week after three rioters were shot – two fatally – in Kenosha, Wisconsin. While Republicans have hammered Biden’s comments as too little, too late, critics of the former vice president have also zeroed in on a tweet from right before the speech, in which he asked if anyone really thought there would be less violence in America if Trump is reelected. Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected? Journalist Caleb HullparsedBiden’s words as“Vote for me or else my supporters will burn down your cities.” Biden’s strategy was to“blackmail Americans into voting for me by threatening more violence unless I win,”tweetedFederalist editor Mollie Hemingway, describing it as“so impossibly evil and strategically unwise.” They were far from the only ones, with thousands of responses by critics who heard Biden threatening more violence if Americans didn’t vote for him. Threatening more violence if people don t vote for you proves that your party is the one causing all the violence. I can t wait to vote against you in November. America will not cave to the demands of the violent left. Others offered video evidence of Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris telling friendly TV host Stephen Colbert that“they’re not gonna stop before election day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after election day.” I believe there would be less if Kamala didn’t proudly and openly encourage it. Great strat guys... see how it plays out.pic.twitter.com/7xTpmctMl5 While Harris was referring to blacklivesmatter protests across America, the Democrats and the mainstream media have spent months referring to the riots as“mostly peaceful protests”even against thebackdropof burning buildings. Another Twitter user offered a list of cities where riots have taken place, pointing out they are all run by Democrats. Trumps?#BidenRiotspic.twitter.com/XY5BItrVQq Not all the responses were critical, however – there were plenty of Democrats who agreed with Biden, calling Trumpan instigatorof violence and a Nazi, while seeking to shut down anyone who disagreed with them as“Russian.” pic.twitter.com/aqVGNWmVwM While Trump condemned the riots at the Republican convention last week, Democrats had not mentioned them at all during theirs. Biden’s strong statement comes after CNN hostDon Lemon panickedthat the issue is hurting Democrats in the polls. On Monday, Biden argued that Trump“can’t stop the violence we re seeing today – because for years he has fomented it.”However, the first blacklivesmatter riots happened in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, when Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president. Reacting to Biden’s remarks, Trump tweeted that the Democrat was blaming police far more than the rioters,“which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left.” Just watched what Biden had to say. To me, he’s blaming the Police far more than he’s blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie supports! The latest political violence also comes after a long string of escalating comments by Democrats denying Trump and his administration legitimacy and urging their supporters to confront them everywhere.

"31 Aug, 2020",Russia now also to blame for US protests & Covid-19 disinformation – latest conspiracy from former intel head turned CNN analyst,"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper went on CNN to accuse Russia of interfering in US affairs including the Covid-19 pandemic, Portland and Kenosha protests, and election meddling while giving no real evidence. Clapper, who has previouslysaidRussians are“typically, almost genetically driven to co-opt, penetrate, gain favor, whatever,”was more than happy to push more xenophobic Russia conspiracy theories during a Monday CNN interview when prompted by anchor Alisyn Camerota. After bringing up violent protests in cities like Portland, Oregon, and Kenosha, Wisconsin – both of which have seen shooting deaths occur during demonstrations and riots – Camerota asked Clapper if he sees“evidence as we saw in 2016 that some of this unrest, some of this online ginning up of discord, you see Russian fingerprints?” “Absolutely,”Clapper replied without hesitation, before also blaming Russians for spreading“disinformation”in regards to the Covid-19 pandemic, including how it“disproportionately”affects minorities. Though conspiracy theories about the Russian government interfering in the 2016 presidential election have been backed up by no real evidence, but rather only second and third-hand information, Clapper used 2016 as his only evidence of this new conspiracy theory. “There’s no question the Russians are exploiting this. Why shouldn’t they? They had huge success in 2016. Why not do it again in 2020?”he said. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) was similarly asked on Monday during a CNN interview whether Russia was at all to blame for making race relations worse in the US, to which Schiff also replied yes and claimed they“are once again doing their best in social media, in the overt media and other means to grow this division again.” Besides consistent history of xenophobic remarks toward Russians, James Clapper has also been accused of lying under oath. Some politicians, including Sen. Rand Paul, have said the former director of national intelligence should beprosecutedfor denying his knowledge of the existence of the NSA’s warrantless spying program.

"29 Aug, 2020","‘Safe’ v. ‘unsafe’ gatherings? In Dems’ Covid HYPOCRISY land, it all depends on whether the event will help get Joe Biden elected","Democrat hypocrisy over which large gatherings are deemed dangerous in the era of Covid-19 reached new heights when a US senator went berserk over Thursday’s Republican National Convention festivities at the White House. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. “Can we take the gloves off and tell the truth?”Senator Chris Murphy said Saturday on Twitter.“Trump is deliberately killing people. He holds rallies where people get infected.”The Connecticut Democrat added:“His plan is to kill people. Let’s just say it.” Can we take the gloves off and tell the truth?Trump is deliberately killing people. He holds rallies where people get infected. On Thursday, no social distancing or masks, sending a clear message that the CDC should be ignored.His plan is to kill people. Let s just say it. I wasn’t aware that the Democrats had been leaving the gloves on in their nearly four years of conspiracy theories and coup efforts against President Donald Trump. Nor have they demonstrated any interest in telling the truth, so this may be a new wrinkle. But the insanity and inanity of Murphy’s statement are something to behold. He thinks he’s cracked the code on the Trump campaign strategy: killing people. One of many problems with this theory is that Trump would first be killing his most enthusiasticsupportersif his scheme were to infect people at his rallies with the virus, which hardly seems like a good way to get more votes. Nevertheless, Murphy is not alone in wearing a tin foil hat. Followers agreed with his theory and added their insights to the plot. One Twitter user suggested that a pandemic simulation done in 2019 might have been a“trial run”for the current murder scheme. Another suggested that Trump knows he will lose the November election, so spreading Covid-19 is his way of“paying back”Americans for abandoning him. A netizen who apparently overlooked the fact that Trump is already president said the pandemic is saving him the trouble of amilitary coup. Strangely, though, neither Murphy nor any other Democrat leader expressed concern over the large mob of protesters who were gathered outside the White House as Trump capped the convention with his speech accepting the party’s presidential nomination. It couldn’t be that Murphy is only concerned about Republican lives because neither he nor any other Democrat leader condemned the mob for surrounding and threatening people trying to walk back to their hotels from the White House after the speech. The woke brigades certainly weren’t following social-distancing guidelines when they accosted Republican Senator Rand Paul, Paul’s wife and other White House guests. Nor were there any Democrat rebukes of Friday’s massive March on Washington, where crowds jammed the National Mall to hear civil rights leaders decry police violence against black people. In fact, we’ve heard not a peep from the left about safety concerns arising from the massive blacklivesmatter protests and riots that have embroiled the nation’s cities for the past three months. Look at all of these people trying to kill other people! What is wrong with them?#CovidIsOverhttps://t.co/fq537fKorq Media outlets and establishment-friendly researchers have told us that the gigantic gatheringsdidn’tcause an increase in Covid-19 cases. Some even went so far as to say the protestsslowedthe virus’ spread. A University of Colorado Denver professor theorized that while the protests brought large groups of people together, they caused even more folks to stay home. Yes, the protests are only to be revered, no matter the number of buildings torched, stores looted, people beaten orpolice peltedwith rocks. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Friday that when she sees“theswift and powerfulprotests that have risen up around the country,”her hope for positive change is revived. Even when the blacklivesmatter gatherings gravitate from noble marches for racial justice to block parties with music and dancing, Senator Murphy and his kind will not accuse anyone of murder. That’s because they see the blacklivesmatter movement boosting voter motivation to help elect their enthusiasm-lacking presidential candidate, Joe Biden, in November. “It’s not safe to open up schools”pic.twitter.com/L7HKW5avpW Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, is among Democrats who haveencouragedviolent protest. She said the protests won’t ever stop – and shouldn’t stop -- and encouraged supporters todonate moneyto bail out people arrested during protests in Minneapolis. Obama said this month in her Democratic National Convention speech that electing Biden is the only hope of“ending this chaos.” The Covid hypocrisy all goes back to power and control. If your activity helps advance the establishment agenda, it’s safe. If it doesn’t, it’s not. Going to church, school or the gym is unsafe. Keeping the abortion clinics and Lottery outlets open is absolutely essential. Abiker rallyin South Dakota is a“superspreading event.”Protesting lockdown restrictions at the state capitol isverboten. A blacklivesmatter mural-painting party in New York is so important that Mayor Bill de Blasio said it“transcendsall normal realities.” Reality is not where the party operates. With the 77-year-old Biden mostly hidden away in his basement to avoid any unscripted moments in public, Democrats have decided that campaign events are especially murderous. If hosting 1,500 people at the White House is bad, holding Trump rallies at 15,000-seat arenas around the country will be downright genocidal. Murphy seems to have left little room for the rhetoric to get even more crazy, but give him time. Calling Trump a premeditated killer may seem tame by November. Like this story?

"29 Aug, 2020",Democrats have directly encouraged violence on the streets. Winding it back isn’t going to be easy,"Protests and riots have spiraled out of control in the US. However, these aren’t spontaneous demonstrations. Instead they’re egged on by Democrats, who seem hell-bent on burning America to the ground. To those fed a diet of mainstream media disinformation, the protests sweeping the US are just that: protests. They’re grassroots affairs, expressions of discontent and resentment at a status quo that oppresses African Americans and denies them the rights and privileges afforded to whites. That may have been true for all of about a day following the death of George Floyd back in May, and some of the protesters no doubt still feel that they’re fighting the good fight. But far more have taken to the streets to commit brazen acts of violence, looting, and criminality. Thousands have been injured, and more than 32 people have been killed, including the two shot in apparent self-defense by teenager Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha on Tuesday night. The riots have been enabled by Democrat leaders who have at best excused and at worst encouraged the most base excesses of the mob. The mob’s latest target was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Paul and his wife were accosted by a screaming crowd of rioters outside the Republican National Convention in Washington, DC on Thursday night. Explaining the event to Fox News on Friday, Paul said that“had they gotten at us they would have gotten us to the ground, we might not have been killed, might just have been injured by being kicked in the head, or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless.” If any Democrat can claim credit for inspiring violent street harassment, it’s California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Back in 2018, Waters told her supporters that if they come across an ally of President Donald Trump in public,“you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” As you watch all the videos of Trump supporters getting targeted and attacked outside the White House tonight, here’s a reminder that one of the Democrats’ leading voices, Maxine Waters, literally encouraged this behavior.pic.twitter.com/v5o4bxWpKO Her supporters followed her words to the letter,harassing and threateningRepublican officials on the streets and in restaurants throughout that summer. However, the violence has since escalated, just as the rhetoric has. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley – a member of the so-called ‘Squad’ and media darling –calledlast week for mobilized“unrest on the streets”against the Trump administration. Way back in June, as Minneapolis and Portland burned, Kamala Harris, now Joe Biden’s running mate, warned the public that the riots are“a movement”that’s“not gonna stop.” Kamala Harris says that the riots are not going to stop, ever, and to BEWARE. With a smile on her face.pic.twitter.com/xkwAUOMJcL “Everyone beware,”Harris exclaimed.“They’re not gonna stop before election day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after election day. They’re not gonna let up and they should not.” A good friend of mine once called the American left wing the“Interahamwe Left.”Given the events of recent months, the comparison is apt. The Interahamwe were a Hutu political movement in the Rwanda of the early 1990s, and helped perpetrate a sickening genocide against the country’s Tutsi minority. Immediately before the butchery began in 1994, a Hutu radio station put out a cryptic broadcast:“Cut down the tall trees.”Hutus across the country took up rifles and machetes and slaughtered an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsis in the course of three months. The genocide was merciless, with neighbor killing neighbor in villages, schools, and churches. That broadcast came after a year of anti-Tutsi radiomessaging, during which Hutu spokesmen ginned up hatred against the Tutsi. Just like the Hutus did in Rwanda, the American left has shut off all avenues for rapprochement and reconciliation. Just look at theharassmentof anyone who refuses to prostrate themselves before the woke mob. Then look at the barbarism that leftist mouthpieceswish upontheir enemies. While it’s true that street violence is a world away from systematic execution, the messaging of the American left is in some way similar. Except the democraticparty doesn’t need to cloak its message in the poetic euphemisms of the Interahamwe. Instead they simply instruct their street fighters to go out and raise hell. Not a single prominent Democrat has issued a clear and unequivocal denunciation of the violence. Joe Biden meekly pleaded with the mob this week to show some restraint, but that only came about after a marked drop in his polling numbers. It’s unlikely that they’d listen anyway. If they were open to reason, the crowd shouting“Breonna Taylor”at Rand Paul would realize that Paul actuallytried to passthe Justice for Breonna Taylor Act in the Senate earlier this summer. The Act would have banned“no-knock”warrants, like the kind Louisville Police Department were serving when they shot Taylor dead in March. But the crowd has gotten a taste for violence, and long since abandoned reason. Biden, Harris and the democraticparty likely saw opportunity in the blacklivesmatter movement. They could praise the protesters in the streets, using the images of thousands of marching demonstrators to highlight the failings of the Trump administration. They could even close their eyes and let the rioters loose as their unofficialTonton Macoutes, terrorizing political opponents. However, even with these boogeymen affecting Democratic poll numbers, it is unlikely that Biden’s wheedling will calm them down. They’ve been fed too much encouraging agitprop for that. Should Biden and Harris manage to win this November, Harris might get exactly what she asked for. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"28 Aug, 2020",FBI running WEEKLY struggle sessions on ‘intersectionality’ in the name of diversity and anti-racism – report,"Christopher Rufo, the researcher who uncovered controversial identity politics courses being taught at numerous US government agencies, is now warning they have now reached the FBI, where they could be politically weaponized. On Friday, Rufo shared screenshots of materials from the FBI Office of Diversity and Inclusion, which began holding weekly“intersectionality”workshops this month. The language and ideology they contain, he says, represent critical race theory, which Rufo calls a“toxic, pseudoscientific, and racist ideology that is taking over our public institutions – and will be weaponized against the American people.” SCOOP: The@FBIis now holding weekly ""intersectionality"" workshops.Let me say it plainly: critical race theory is a toxic, pseudoscientific, and racist ideology that is taking over our public institutions—and will be weaponized against the American people.Time to fight back.pic.twitter.com/N40HJAdTmT The discovery comes just days after Rufo published information about the racially segregated training sessions and“white male reeducation camps”at the Sandia National Laboratories, one of the three major US nuclear research facilities. That publication has reportedly inspired one of the engineers at Sandia to blow the whistle on the entire operation. This twisted and insidious racist push is damaging all sorts of institutions, and seems highly dangerous in one like Sandia National Laboratory. Chris Rufo with Discovery Institute reports on these attacks on white men using ""critical race theory"" -https://t.co/4GxwC9dsNR Rufo has previously documented the content of“diversity”and“anti-racism”workshops being conducted at a number of government agencies in the Treasury Department. Similar materials have surfaced in the US Army, and on the website of the Smithsonian Museum of African-American History and Culture. While the existence of these programs is not exactly new – professional consultants providing them have been billing the government for millions over the past decade or more – it has attracted renewed attention in recent months due to the rise of ‘anti-racism’ literature. Books such as Robin DiAngelo’s ‘White Fragility’ and Ibram X. Kendi’s ‘How to be Anti-Racist’ found themselves propelled to the top of bestseller lists by advocates for“racial justice,”in the wake of blacklivesmatter protests that began in early June and quickly turned violent. In afollowuptweet on Friday, Rufo says the FBI “has tremendous power and if it is corrupted by critical race theory, it could be turned against political enemies–and undermine our republic.” This is arguably an understatement, given all the evidence implicating the top FBI leadership in spying on President Donald Trump’s campaign before and after the 2016 election, as well as manufacturing a pretext to charge his first national security adviser Michael Flynn. Former FBI Director James Comey actually gave aspeechat Georgetown University in 2015, affirming the key tenet of critical race theory – the existence of“unconscious bias.” “Many people in our white-majority culture have unconscious racial biases and react differently to a white face than a black face,”Comey said, urging law enforcement to“redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice.” Under the current director, Chris Wray, the FBI boasts of being named one of the top government employers in 2020 by DiversityJobs – a companydedicatedto promoting“diversity and inclusion in the workplace”by hiring people according to their identity characteristics. “The FBI’s commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion is integrated into every facet of employment,”the Bureau says on itswebsite.

"28 Aug, 2020",Boycott over: NBA playoffs to resume on Saturday after suspension over Jacob Blake shooting,"The NBA has announced that the playoffs will resume on Saturday after an accord was struck with the league s players union which will see the establishment of a social justice coalition designed to tackle inequality. The agreement comes amid widespread protests following the shooting of African-American man Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin and follows the spate of blacklivesmatter protests which engulfed many major sports - and in particular the NBA - in recent months. A tense initial discussion between representatives of the remaining playoff teams was ended when the game s most well-known player, LeBron James, left a meeting in which teams were coordinating a response to the latest in a series of violent incidents between law enforcement and members of the United States African-American community. It was also reported that several high-profile players favored canceling the playoffs before the agreement between the NBA and the NBPA was finalized on Friday. James was followed out of the meeting earlier this week by his Los Angeles Lakers teammates and representatives of the Los Angeles Clippers. Previously, the Milwaukee Bucks announced that they were boycotting their playoff game against the Orlando Magic in protest against Blake s shooting. The decision made by the Bucks was underscored by the other remaining teams in the NBA bubble in Florida and its echo was felt in several other sports including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League. However, the terms of the agreement announced by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts on Friday state that the league will allow team arenas to be used as venues to vote in the upcoming elections on November 3 in addition to the formation of a social justice coalition . Additionally, a wave of advertising promoting voting rights will appear throughout broadcasts of the recommenced playoff games. Joint NBA and NBPA statement:pic.twitter.com/EFp6fG9oZs Per an official release from the NBA, the terms of the agreement are as follows: 1.  The NBA and its players have agreed to immediately establish a social justice coalition, with representatives from players, coaches and governors, that will be focused on a broad range of issues, including increasing access to voting, promoting civic engagement and advocating for meaningful police and criminal justice reform. 2.  In every city where the league franchise owns and controls the arena property, team governors will continue to work with local elections officials to convert the facility into a voting location for the 2020 general election to allow for a safe in-person voting option for communities vulnerable to COVID. If a deadline has passed, team governors will work with local elections officials to find another election-related use for the facility, including but not limited to voter registration and and ballot receiving boards. 3.  The league will work with the players and our network partners to create and include election spots in each NBA playoff game dedicated to promoting greater civic engagement in national and local elections and raising awareness around voter access and opportunity. Various teams have returned to practice on Friday, though several media appearances have been cancelled. It is understood that the games scheduled to have taken place on Wednesday will now take place on Saturday, and those intended for Thursday will now happen on Sunday. The regular playoff schedule will then be observed after that. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"28 Aug, 2020","Widow of retired police officer David Dorn, slain during blacklivesmatter riots, to speak at RNC as Dems lose ground on lawlessness issue","The widow of retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn, who was shot to death in June during a violent blacklivesmatter protest, could become the most important voice among Thursday’s Republican National Convention speakers. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. That’s because Ann Dorn will broach and humanize a subject that has emerged as perhaps the most troubling issue facing Democrats heading into November’s election: law and order. Dorn will talk about the horrible pain she has suffered as a result of her 77-year-old husbandbeing murderedwhile trying to protect a friend’s pawnshop from rioters. She will offer the additional perspective of a current law enforcement officer, as she’s also a St. Louis police sergeant. Her words will call attention to the escalating violence and criminality that has occurred since protests broke out across the nation in the wake of Minneapolis black man George Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have successfully turned that issue against Democrats, who for months have tried to downplay and ignore the mayhem. It’s one of the biggest reasons that Trump’sapproval ratingshave risen in recent weeks. Support for Trump got another boost with this week’s deadly protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a black man was shot in the back seven times by police on Sunday. CNN host Don Lemon acknowledged the political problem on Wednesday, saying the riots are“ablind spotfor Democrats.”Lemon suggested that lawlessness is the one issue that could torpedo Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s chances of winning:“It’s showing up in the polls. It’s showing up in focus groups. It’s the only thing right now that is sticking.” Media outlets have posted articles critical of Ann Dorn’s speech even before she speaks. Several of those pieces, including an International Business Times story on Thursday, citedDavid Dorn’s daughtersas saying they don’t want his widow to speak at the RNC.“It’s very frustrating because I know my dad did not agree with a lot of Trump’s policies or procedures,”said one of the daughters, Debra White. The other daughter, Lisa Dorn, was quoted as saying:“We don’t want his death or his legacy or any of his images to be used for political gain.” Another line of attack came in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial on Wednesday saying that Ann Dorn’s speech would miss the point. Trump has sought to blur the line between peaceful protests against racial injustice and opportunistic criminals who exploit such protests, the newspaper said. The widow also will fail to address thereal crisisthat contributed to David Dorn’s death, easy access to guns, the editorial added. Unfortunately for Democrats, as the focus groups cited by Lemon have shown, Americans are increasingly inclined to blame those who are committing the violence and those who are trying to look the other way.

Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi The six letters inR.I.P.O.F.F.best describe how America has quickly transitioned from a democracy to an oligarchy and how left-wing totalitarianism is just around the bend. What s happening in America now is a class war, plain and simple. The democraticparty and its media propagandists will tell you it’s systemic racism, social injustice, or white supremacy. But it’s a class war that is egged on by the democraticparty ’s politicians and their water-carrying partners in the mainstream media echo chamber and if you disagree, you are a racist who must be cancelled. The 2016“resist everything Trump”movement was founded by Hillary Clinton, who has spent four years refusing to admit or accept her stunning defeat in the last presidential election. For hundreds of years, America has always had a smooth transition of power after the people voted. This was not the case in 2016. No former president (or failed candidate) has ever spoken out or actively interfered with the peaceful transition and transfer of power after a political election. Barack Obama s most recent visceral attacks on President Trump have fanned and acted as an accelerant fuelling the flames of civil unrest, discord, and tribalism across the nation. Michelle Obama s recent speech mentioning her“oppression,”given from their 11-million-dollar summer residence on Cape Cod, was tone-deaf and out of touch with America’s 40 million unemployed workers, Americans who cannot feed their families, and the victims of the violent mobs murdering, looting, and creating anarchy in the nation s biggest cities. During the Obama/Biden administration, racial tensions escalated markedly as manufacturing jobs left and wealth inequality increased, resulting in the Occupy Wall Street movement which was later rolled into a refinement of the blacklivesmatter movement. All blacklivesmatter but many disagree with the ideology of the ‘movement’ which does nothing to protect all black lives. Too many Americans and the media are conflating the“ blacklivesmatter movement,”which was founded by three socialists and contains very destructive elements within its ranks, as a shield to destroy capitalism. Elements within the movement have embraced violence as a“means to an end”and have openly accepted Antifa as a pervasive force within the movement to force the establishment to capitulate to the demands of it, such as defunding the police, income redistribution and reimagining our entire system of social and legal justice, by any means necessary. Where was the national debate? No, it was shut up and obey, or you will be deemed a racist, fired from your job and cancelled. Antifa are domestic terrorists who are burning and destroying cities across America. Skyrocketing rates of murder, violent crime, looting and arson have displaced the rule of law in America. Not one uber-liberal democraticparty politician has condemned these riots and race conflicts, which are leading to broader race wars and tribalism becoming the new reality. It s laughable how the media continue referring to this obvious anarchy, chaos and lawlessness as“peaceful protests”(I thought that yesterday’s CNN one was a parody at first - but no!). I thought this was disinformation when I saw the screenshots; It s not.A CNN reporter is genuinely stood in front of a burning neighbourhood telling viewers that violent riots were in fact mostly peaceful protests , after the shootings, of course! 🤯MSM is a parody of itselfpic.twitter.com/ZNioZXf8Zi The media are losing their last sliver of credibility as they accelerate this death and destruction by denying the violence and shifting the narrative, rather than condemning it and demanding immediate action to stop the anarchy now. The entire Democratic National Convention focus was not on policy or how to improve the lives of every American, but rather on“Orange Man Bad, vote for us.” It’s almost as if the media s tech oligarchs’ corporate masters are demanding that the unrest continues, so the oligarchs instil fear in order to punish those daring to vote for Trump and to gain a monopoly on global business. The more small businesses that are destroyed and the more cities that are hollowed out, the faster globalism is achieved. The oligarchs of Silicon Valley control the news flow via Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. And soon Amazon will dominate all of retail and food distribution. These oligarchs seek to have a class of obedient workers reliant on big government. Why wouldn t they support riots that destroy the competition? Intolerance and intimidation only work until they backfire catastrophically with extreme retribution. The retribution is likely to be severe as most people are done accepting being“beat up, harassed, bullied and lied to by the media.”When law enforcement is absent, the silent majority will be forced to protect themselves from this infestation of lawless criminal thugs who disregard life, destroy property, loot, demand income redistribution and the defunding of the police – all under a banner of social justice and equality. One of the protest organizers encouraged rioters to“burn down the businesses because they have insurance.”This will get ugly quickly. Once upon a time, one would only see this in a banana republic, not in America. People pay taxes on the basis that the government protects the population. The Democratic politicians in NYC, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis and Kenosha have issued a stand-down order to police that has resulted in a massive increase in the number of murders and violent crimes committed, as well as the wide-scale destruction of property and small businesses people have worked their whole lives creating. This is an example of the American dream rapidly becoming a nightmare where politicians have disregarded their oaths of office to protect the people they serve; there is no longer any safety in communities. SHUT UP And OBEY or be fired, cancelled, harassed by the mob, demonetized, and deemed unemployable. The new normal is oppression. The“occupy”movements have been rebranded under the banner of the blacklivesmatter movement and this will cause huge blowback that may result in a civil war, which is precisely the outcome the oligarchs are seeking so they may easily implement a tyrannical dictatorship, where everything is rigged and all liberties are permanently suspended. Welcome to Orwell’s 1984. Jacob Blake’s shooting was tragic. The full story has yet to be disclosed, and the investigations are underway. Blake was wanted by police in connection with a sexual assault he committed and had a history as a violent criminal offender. Several new videos are surfacing that show Blake was fighting with police. It is further alleged that Blake had a knife in his hand and told police he was going into his car to get a gun. Is this true? We do not know yet. What we do know is how politicians and jabbering heads from the media immediately condemned the police, without all the evidence, facts and circumstances, because it fits a narrative. In America, we have due process; this new lot of socialist democrats wish to rewrite history and want the power to convict before trial. This is called mob rule. Where is the Department Of Justice’s Civil Rights Division for the protection of EVERY citizen s rights? Their silence is deafening. The fake news media s democraticparty calls Trump s vision for law, order and growth in America dystopian and dark. Hillary Clinton has told Joe Biden he“should not concede the 2020 election under any circumstances because we have hired an army of lawyers to fight the result in case we lose.”This officially signals America s arrival into banana-republic governance, where elections are rigged and meaningless. Well, Joe Biden had 47 years in Washington to straighten out the country – and all he did was to make millions off the backs of everyday Americans. The fake fact-checkers and news media are sowing the seeds of discontent and fear, so that the oligarchs of Silicon Valley can tip the 2020 presidential election in favour of Biden. Fearful people will vote for change. This fear will be manipulated not only by the fake news media but also by the even bigger fraudsters in Silicon Valley. The far left globalist agenda to rule Wokistan, sorry, America, must be stopped. While Trump may not be perfect he is better than hidin’ Biden and he has uncovered the fake media for what they are: the enemy of the people. It’s time to wake up!

And that s exactly what they re deprived of when NBA postpones playoffs because of a political stunt by Milwaukee Bucks, who refused to show up in solidarity with blacklivesmatter protesters. The most vocal, LeBron James Los Angeles Lakers included, have called to cut the season short altogether. Meanwhile, the UFC’s prelim bouts have seen an increase in viewership. It continues to go up from 900,000 average viewers to 1.173 million. Now, preliminary fights for the UFC very rarely have any star power to them, unless it’s the final bout on the prelims. At that point, you may see a promising up-and-comer or someone on the bottom end of the top ten. The real meat is on the pay-per-view, obviously. Such an increase is uncanny, but there is a theory to why we are seeing this rise. Though Dana White is a friend of Donald Trump and has defended him in public, UFC broadcasts are largely apolitical. The broadcasters keep the discussion solely on fighting, and that’s it. You’re not going to hear anything about blacklivesmatter , Joe Biden or Donald Trump. You can expect to get the analysis and the play by play. There are no blacklivesmatter slogans anywhere instead of ads on the Octagon. The social media profiles stick to the combat as well. It’s a nice departure from what other sports are doing. This supports the general theory that “going woke” for an entertainment or cultural outlet leads to going broke. Though that statement isn’t accurate 100 percent of the time, there’s definitely some validity to it. Politics are not a fun thing to think about. Nobody wants to start discussing abortion law or the application of John Locke’s philosophy to politics while they’re watching the Super Bowl. You don’t want to be that guy at the party, because you’re going to be seen as a major downer. So when you’re putting “ blacklivesmatter ” on your play area when people chanting those same words are burning cities, it’s not the best look. The UFC is a great example of focus on product. You know what you’re getting, and it’s reliable. Someone is going to get punched in the head, and someone may tap out. You may even see a bone break. Fun times for all! There’s a security in the programming that you re just not getting with other sports. With the NBA at this point, you may as well watch replays of the DNC or overlay a Joe Biden speech with the programming. It’s just not fun to watch. If you can’t make it fun to watch, people will tune out. People go to sports to escape. If they can’t escape to what you’re offering, are you worth anything at that point as entertainment?

"27 Aug, 2020","The woke left, once useful foot soldiers for the Dems, are chasing voters into the arms of Trump, as emboldened monsters prove","Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden has the right strategy in campaigning from his basement, staying mostly out of public view to avoid exposing his cognitive deterioration and his bad ideas. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. If only far-left activists could have done the same, staying in their mothers basements until after election day, Stealthy Joe might just be able to glide to victory. He might have become president without really having to show voters whether he can coherently utter an unscripted sentence or offer a platform beyond""Trump is evil."" Luckily for President Donald Trump, the woke mobs have been more active and visible than ever. Americans are getting a chance to see more and more what the woke brigades are about, and in this case, to know them is not to love them. Voters also can t help but notice how the cowards who run the party are trying to condone, ignore or deny away the reality of what s happening in the streets. And just as can happen with an unruly child, weak or nonexistent leadership tends to embolden his worst side and bring out ever-escalating lawlessness until someone is seriously hurt or in jail. The adults in the democraticparty have long since either abandoned it or decided that it s better to feign blindness than to be taken to the guillotine by the Jacobin mob. It s gone so far that this week s rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, escalated to the point that CNN host Don Lemon sounded the alarm Tuesday night, warning that Biden will lose votes in November if he doesn t stand up to rioters.""This is a blind spot for Democrats,""Lemon said.""I think Democrats are ignoring this problem or hoping that it will go away. And it s not going to go away."" Lemon s comments marked a watershed moment in the presidential campaign. Here s one of CNN s leading apologists for blacklivesmatter and Antifa misconduct recognizing – out loud – that the Democrats may be in serious trouble. A leading player of the anti-Trump media s CONfidence game is ahead of Biden in realizing that voters are being turned off by the mayhem. Unfortunately for the party, it may be too late. Biden may have crossed the Rubicon with his policy of see no evil, hear no evil. For him to step up now and scold agitators and opportunists who have become drunk on power wouldn t be taken seriously, and he would risk revolt by the Bernie Sanders wing of the party, which doesn t like him to begin with. As Lemon points out, Biden may be afraid to give a speech taking on the rioting. Even if he does, the far left has already authored too many of those seminal moments that can cause voters to rethink where they stand – and whom they stand with. These are the kinds of moments that stick in a person s mind and help shape their world view much more powerfully than a brilliant speech or a clever campaign ad. Kenosha has already given us a few of those moments, such as when an elderly man was beaten up for trying to protect his business from looters and arsonists, or when a man pleaded with rioters to not""destroy people s businesses,""only to be told,""We ll burn your shop down, too."" Looters assault an older business owner trying to defend his business in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 24, 2020.pic.twitter.com/LdlLnOpvfJ Riots in other cities have given us such heartbreaking moments as the murder of retired police captainDavid Dornin St Louis and the vicious beating ofAdam Hanerin Portland, who was attacked after trying to help a transgender woman who was allegedly being robbed by a group of blacklivesmatter activists. “We’ll burn your shop down too.”#Kenosha#BlackLivesMatterpic.twitter.com/m41xhcbowt To watch the horrifying violence and destruction play out on social media while the mainstream media and Democrat politicians speak of""peaceful protests""is both scary and infuriating. As conservative author Mike Cernovich said Wednesday on Twitter,""These rioters are unintentionally Trump s interns."" Kenosha Wisconsin is burninghttps://t.co/fOhuA4jf4S Democrat Congressman Jerry Nadler went so far as to call the Antifa violence in Portland a""myththat s being spread only in Washington, D.C.""Speaking of lying, opportunists in Chicago pounced earlier this month when police shot a black man who allegedly first shot at them. Police say manipulators lied about the suspect s age and stirred up an angry crowd. That night, caravans of""protesters""drove to Chicago s poshMiracle Mileshopping district to loot such stores as Nordstrom, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Democrat-run cities have done little to protect property and law-abiding citizens. Some, such as Portland, have refused help from federal forces to quell the violence. Prosecutors have not only declined to put rioters in jail in many cases but have filed charges against those who resist the mob, such as theSt. Louis couplewho brandished guns after demonstrators broke down the gates of their private neighborhood and allegedly threatened to burn their house down and kill them and their pets. blacklivesmatter activists have made their demonstrations more in-your-face to the general public in recent weeks. In Portland and Seattle, they have marched through residential areas late at night, blocking streets and yelling at residents. Last week in Portland, protesters shined lights in people s windows and banged drums as the crowd chanted,""Wake up, wake up, wake up motherfu**er, wake up."" “Wake up, mother f—ker wake up!” chant blacklivesmatter in Portland tonight as they go through residential areas and shut down the streets.pic.twitter.com/DOah2d1yji This week in the nation s capital, groups of mostly white blacklivesmatter demonstrators confronted diners at sidewalk restaurants and demanded that they raise a clinched fist to show solidarity with the group. Those who declined were screamed-at and threatened as the mob chanted,""White silence is violence,""and""No justice, no peace."" The Evergreen College mindset has left the campus.https://t.co/mOTGPdUf6l The display was so disgusting that mainstream journalists tweeted disapproval. Former New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss called the behavior""vile and un-American.""Even MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted,""What horrible people."" It s worth noting that most of the diners confronted by blacklivesmatter s black shirts obediently raised a fist. A lot of people are too cowardly or too cautious to stand up to such intimidation tactics, especially when they re standing alone, but they won t support overheated wokeness in the privacy of the voting booth.

"26 Aug, 2020",Taking cues from Don Lemon? Biden rushes to condemn Kenosha riots after CNN host says Dem silence ‘shows up in the polls’,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has denounced the “needless violence” that has gripped Kenosha for three days, prompting critics to suggest that his delayed response was due to bad poll results. Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.Is this the country we want to be?Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice.pic.twitter.com/WdNqrxA3PK As Kenosha is bracing itself for a potential fourth night of violent unrest that has already seen numerous local businesses ransacked and torched, Biden released a video statement, urging protesters to stop destroying their own communities. Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence – violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community The chaos in Kenosha has alreadycosttwo people their lives. Biden s admission that it was a far cry from a peaceful blacklivesmatter rally came shortly after prominent CNN host Don Lemon opined that, by keeping quiet on the crisis, Democrats risk losing the demographics the former VP needs to have on board in the November election. “It’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups,”Lemon said, speaking to fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo on Tuesday evening. In the rare criticism of the democraticparty , Lemon said that it was“ignoring this problem or hoping it will go away,”adding that neither appears to be happening any time soon. The timing of Biden’s statement was not lost on conservatives, suggesting that he was moved by his polling numbers rather than by the plight of the businesses he referred to in his message when he took aim at rioters and looters. “I noticed that CNN said your polls were probably down because of the rioting. I’m guessing that’s why you finally mentioned about rioting and the violence being wrong. I think it was Lemon that said it,”a commenter said. I noticed that CNN said your polls were probably down because of the rioting. I’m guessing that’s why you finally mentioned about rioting and the violence being wrong. I think it was Lemon that said it. Well, it seems, at least,@JoeBidenlistened to Don Lemon’s advice.pic.twitter.com/tRhzAp3xmw Just say ""I got the new polls and people do not like riots, looting and violence so I’m gonna pretend now after months of calling them peaceful that I now discourage it"" Others accused Biden of jumping on the bandwagon by coming out against the violence“90 days too late.” Joe, this plead and running mate’s attempt to finally come out against the violence is 90 days to late. You continue to amaze most of America with your lack of addressing issues real time. You continue to show your true lack of empathy to Americans. Some maybe fooled but most not The poll numbers cited by Lemon have not been made public. However, public polls tell a similar story. Asurveyreleased by Marquette University Law School on Wednesday found that approval of street protests has dropped from 61 percent in June to 48 percent this month. Support for the blacklivesmatter movement has also fallen by 10 points, to 49 percent, while support for the police has increased and only 17 percent of respondents agree with defunding police departments – a core demand of some blacklivesmatter activists and Democratic politicians. While parts of Kenosha have been almost reduced to scorched earth in the three days following the Sunday shooting of black man Jacob Flake by police, violence has also marred the protests against police brutality for three months in the wake of the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody in late May.

"26 Aug, 2020",Taking blacklivesmatter protests to a whole new level? Toronto Raptors discussed BOYCOTTING playoff matches over Jacob Blake shooting,"The Toronto Raptors have discussed boycotting Game 1 of the NBA second-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics to protest against the shooting of Jacob Blake by Wisconsin police. On Tuesday the team held a meeting to discuss how they can react to the widely-discussed case of Blake, a 29-year-old unarmed black man who was shot in the back by a policeman on Sunday.

Toronto Raptors Masai Ujiri releases footage of deputy sheriff initiating assault after NBA Finals Blake s father said that his son was shot seven times while trying to enter a car when three of his children were present. Video of the accident recorded from a window across the street was widely shared on social media, producing a bombshell effect in the US, with many NBA players raising questions about whether the playoff games should be held at all. “We knew coming here or not coming here was not going to stop anything, but I think ultimately playing or not playing puts pressure on somebody,” Raptors guard Fred VanVleetsaid. The question of holding the NBA games preceded the 2020 Bubble opening last month, with many players, led by Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, speaking out against resuming the championship, saying it could distract people from nationwide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. In the wake of Flyoyd’s death, large-scale protests swept across the country, with many athletes from different sports kneeling during the national anthem to protest against apparent police brutality. If the Raptors boycott the upcoming play-off game they will bring the blacklivesmatter movement to a brand new level, as a team’s protest could affect TV broadcast schedules, the outcome of the game and sponsors’ interests.

"25 Aug, 2020",‘You don’t recognize my existence!’: Former DNC head Donna Brazile has meltdown on Fox News (VIDEO),"Former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile melted down in spectacular fashion on Fox News, accusing fellow commentator Tammy Bruce of racism and demanding she “recognize my existence.” Discussing Monday night’s Republican National Convention on Tuesday morning’s Fox & Friends, Brazile accused the republicanparty of“speaking to the choir”with their unabashedly pro-Trump lineup of speakers. Conservative contributor Tammy Bruce shot back, accusing the Democrats of being out of touch with ordinary Americans, and slamming the left for not speaking out strongly enough against the blacklivesmatter riots ripping through US cities. Brazile saw red, and immediately accused Bruce of“ignoring”racism in the US.“It sounds like I will never be an American in your world, because after 400 years, my family cannot walk out of this house without fearing violence!”she shouted. “No-one is saying that,”Bruce tried to interject, but Brazile continued.“You need to listen as well as talk,”she declared.“You ignore the pains of people that are hurting… You do not recognize my existence!” “You’re the shameful one Tammy, because I will not allow you to erase my existence.” Brazile and Bruce bickered and sniped for more than a minute, as host Brian Kilmeade attempted to restore some sort of order.“I’m not too sure anyone benefited from that,”Kilmeade remarked as he cut away from the debate. Brazile’s meltdown was mocked online. The former DNC chief“went careening off the cliff of sanity and fell into a sea of crazy”pundit Wayne Dupreejibed. Even some of Brazile’sfanswere disappointed to see her pull“the race card with hyper speed.” I just gotta say@HeyTammyBruceis a saint for not walking off during Donna Brazile’s tantrum on Fox today. 😇 .@donnabrazileis getting her butt handed to her, so she decides to inject race and emotions. This doesn t belong on television@foxandfriends I haven t watched#FoxandFriendsfor months, I turn it on today and Donna Brazile was lecturing Tammy Bruce about 400 years of slavery. Fox is a dumpster fire. Fox’s decision to hire Brazile as a contributor last yearangeredplenty of conservatives, including President Donald Trump. Before she was taken on board by Fox, Brazile was ousted from CNN in 2016, after leaked emails revealed that she slipped debate questions to Hillary Clinton’s aides ahead of Clinton’s debate showdown with then-candidate Trump.

"25 Aug, 2020","Day one of the RNC: Good sentiment, but too little substance","The Republicans opened their convention by largely speaking about cultural issues, to show they are still sane.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC With the DNC’s daily loony statements, it’s no wonder more time was spent making memes about the convention than seriously discussing it. In this regard, the Republicans just had to come out and say“Hey, we’re not crazy.”That’s exactly what they did – but it wasn’t exactly a high bar to top, and Republicans need to do more if they want to sway anyone. There were some very good and rousing speeches given by Republican heavy hitters such as Senator Tim Scott and former Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. However, the topics of those speeches were things that were purely cultural and purely emotional. Granted, against the backdrop of two Democratic cities literally burning because of blacklivesmatter protests, the Republican message hits home with its target audience. But sentiment must always be followed up with solutions. Of the two major political parties in the United States, patriotism is more a part of the Republicans’ platform than the Democrats’. But patriotism by its nature only goes so far. As a conservative, it s nice to have a convention where people are not saying that everything is racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic etc. But where s the beef? There are issues of law enforcement, border security, economy, and Covid-19 response that need to be addressed. People are going to want to know what s going to happen with the border. To boil it down to one question,“what about the wall?”You can also tie law enforcement to that same area. Over the last couple of months, we have seen city after city succumb to massive riots and property damage. Lives have been lost as well. People standing in the middle are going to want to know exactly what the government under Republican leadership can do to solve these problems. Is the National Guard going to get deployed? Will there be more involvement by federal law enforcement? Will Antifa finally be declared a terrorist organization? These are pressing concerns, and if they re not addressed, you can kiss the independents’ vote goodbye. As for the economy and the Covid-19 response, citizens want to know how we are going to heal. Is there going to be work done to lower taxes for businesses? What about the tax rate on medical care? Is there going to be another stimulus package that would be passed by Congress? These are all elements the people are thinking about for the health of their own families, both physically and with the pocketbook. As with law enforcement, if these questions aren t answered you re going to have a hard time hooking moms in the suburbs who are worried about their husbands’ paycheck and their kids health. In essence, for the republicanparty to score an easy victory we ll have to be the party of solutions. Right now, Americans do not want fluff jobs. They do not want the political equivalent of a sales call from a telemarketer. They want something that s going to be in their hand. If that s not the strategy, then it s going to be just as destined to fail as when Mike Tyson fought Buster Douglas and just tried to knock him out with one punch.

"25 Aug, 2020",Nikki Haley fuels speculation of 2024 run with republicanparty convention speech,"Former US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley has sparked rumors that she is eyeing the White House, after using her address to support US President Donald Trump while also laying out her own vision for the country. Haley accused Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his party of“blaming America first,”and pushed back on the notion that“America is racist.” “That is a lie. America is not a racist country,”Haley said.“This is personal for me.” As the daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley argued that she was able to excel despite growing up as a“brown girl in a black and white world.”She noted that South Carolina had elected her as the state’s first minority, female governor. Describing the United States as a“work in progress,”she criticized the Democrats for their divisive rhetoric and for“turning a blind eye towards riots and rage”amid months of blacklivesmatter protests that have erupted across the nation. If you missed my speech tonight, here’s the video. ❤️🇺🇸https://t.co/4w89mVGAP1 Her speech was hailed by many conservative pundits, with some even labeling her a clear contender in 2024.

Haley’s tenure as UN ambassador was highly controversial, with the former governor using her seat on the Security Council to give dramatic presentations about alleged chemical attacks in Syria, as well as accuse Iran of providing missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen.

"20 Aug, 2020",Tire ire: NASCAR s Trump 2020 car to stick with Goodyear tires despite US president s call to boycott brand,"The car bearing President Donald Trump s name on the NASCAR circuit has stated that it has no choice but to stick with Goodyear tires after Trump called for a boycott of the Ohio-based company on Wednesday. Corey LaJoie has driven the Trump 2020 car at numerous races this season, with it s MAGA-inspired decals coming as a result of a sponsorship deal between his team, Go Fas Racing, and a political action committee called Patriots of America which supports Trump s 2020 re-election campaign, and while he says he is generally supportive of Trump s policies, the deal that NASCAR has in place with Goodyear means that he has no choice to but use the brand which is currently in the White house doghouse. ""We just have one way to run them,"" Go Fas Racing general manager Mason St. Hilaire told US media. ""It’s either those tires or no tires. We don’t have much of a choice. There should be two. I don’t know if you should just have one. You’ve got to keep something for the competition, right? Putting another one in would probably be a little bit of fun, both for cost and competition."" Trump s ire at the tire brand can be traced to a re cent announcement in which they barred employees from wearing any political messaging at work in the lead-in to the US Presidential election in November, with The Donald s squarely framing the situation as a ban on his popular brand of red MAGA hats. Indeed, political messaging in opposition of the Trump administration was also outlawed. Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!). NASCAR has yet to comment on the situation. The car racing league also came under fire from some sections of its support earlier this year when a ban on fans flying confederate flags are their races was announced in the wake of the wave of blacklivesmatter protests following the death of George Floyd in May. It should also be noted that Trump s presidential limousine uses Goodyear tires. Who wants to tell him.pic.twitter.com/cMrvwxbpm1 NASCAR and Goodyear extended their partnership 2017, some 20 years after first linking and has become the most popular tire brand in the United States - and one of the most popular in the world. Goodyear is based in Akron, Ohio and employs almost 70,000 workers - around a thousand of which are US military veterans. Meanwhile, Go Fas Racing s St. Hilaire has expressed his reluctance at being central to an ongoing political debate. ""You’ve just got to look at all the information, I guess, you look at both sides,"" he said. ""It doesn’t look like whatever was out there on the internet came from corporate. It looks like maybe it was some sort of independent-type form that came out. It’s unfortunate. How does that even get out there? I feel bad for Goodyear to deal with this stuff with everything going on right now. In a competitive atmosphere, if you had two different ones, you’d play who’s stronger.""

"18 Aug, 2020",Women leering over Kamala Harris’ husband & hailing him as a ‘Hot Jewish Dad’? Further proof that feminism is fraudulent,"It’s apparently fine for female journalists to sexually objectify the vice-presidential candidate’s spouse, labeling him the Democractic Party’s ‘DILF’. But imagine if men did this to a male candidate’s wife. ByPeter Lloyd, journalist and author based in London. If it weren’t for double-standards, the left wouldn’t have any standards at all. That’s the sort of politically-motivated joke we can expect to hear much more of in the run-up to America’s 2020 election, which reaches fever pitch on November 3. And, to be fair, it’s hardly unjustified... When footage appeared of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attending a party in black face, he wasn’t canceled by die-hard progressives who believe blacklivesmatter . He simply carried on regardless. Then, when Elizabeth Warren fraudulently self-identified as a Native American, earning herself the nickname Pocahontas, she was duly forgiven and even protected by fellow comrades, who described any valid criticism of her as sexist. More recently, liberals barely batted an eyelid when America’s favourite lesbian, Ellen DeGeneres, faced accusations of tolerating a toxic work environment on her daily talk show. She too survived the wrath of the pitchfork mob, who – in their bid to end discrimination – seem to, err, discriminate against their targets whenever it’s expedient. So it’s perhaps not surprising that feminists are the latest to indulge in double standards by sexually objectifying Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. That’s right, people – the election coverage has already sunk to a new low and we still have three months to go! Forget whatever we’re supposed to have learnt from the MeToo movement, the Guardian’s Poopy Noor said that she’s“obsessed”with the high-profile entertainment lawyer and devoted father-of-two, hailing him as the “DILF” of the democraticparty ’s inner circle. According to her, it’s not only acceptable to leer at him, but it’s an act of girl power. “It is feminist to obsess,” Noor says. “Emhoff does, after all, give off the opposite of toxic masculine energy. While it is commonplace in some quarters to pejoratively refer to men who like women too much as ‘simps’; here is a man who’s proudly a fan of his wife on Instagram!” Meanwhile, Jenny Singer atForward.comdescribed Emhoff as“a Hot Jewish Dad.” “I cannot stress this enough: you have the option to skip debating Kamala Harris appearance and choose instead to objectify her husband Doug Emhoff, a Hot Jewish Dad,” she wrote on Twitter. She added: “If Bernie Sanders is a Zayde [a Jewish grandfather], then Doug Emhoff is a Zaddy. (‘Zaddy’ is a slang term for a mature man who has raw sex appeal and possibly, a mortgage.)” Hilariously, these crass comments come just days after Hillary Clinton urged the media not to indulge in ‘sexist’ journalism during the election process. The ex- democraticparty leader, who famously lost both of her high-profile bids in 2008 and 2016, demanded an end to the cat-calling of candidates; something that’s pretty rich when you consider no leader in history has ever suffered more scathing scrutiny than Donald Trump. In the past four years he’s been ridiculed over everything from his hair to the (alleged) size of his penis. But, of course, none of this matters to feminist activists who masquerade as journalists. Their sole motivation is to oust Republicans from the White House at any cost – even if that means betraying other women. After all, Joe Biden remains accused of inappropriate behavior by several alleged victims. The very same women who had the public support of Kamala Harris... until she was announced as Biden’s running mate, when all of her loyalty vanished. How convenient. Like this story?

"18 Aug, 2020","Democratic Convention rides on blacklivesmatter momentum, putting George Floyd family front & center in moment of silence","On the first night of its national convention, the democraticparty has sought to cash in on months of raging protests over police brutality to sell 2020 nominee Joe Biden, trotting out George Floyd’s relatives at the event. “George had a giving spirit, a spirit that has shown up on streets around our nation and around the world. People of all races, all ages, all genders, all backgrounds, peacefully protesting in the name of love and unity,”said Philonise Floyd, the brother of the man slain by Minneapolis police in May, bringing in a moment of silence to honor the memory of“the many other souls we lost to hate and injustice.” It’s up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions will be their legacies. ‘They should all be alive today’: Speaking from Houston, Philonise Floyd introduced a moment of silence to honor his brother George and others killed at the hands of police. Follow live#DemConventionupdateshttps://t.co/8mtXh0wSovpic.twitter.com/2OT0guA2ct Though both Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have frequently backed ‘tough-on-crime’ policies that have taken a disproportionate toll on black communities – with Biden helping to write acontroversial 1994 crime billand Harris working as a career prosecutor with aless than progressive record– the democraticparty has thrown its weight behind growing calls for police reform in recent months. The blacklivesmatter movement has led those demands, and is expected to feature heavily throughout the four-day convention, with DNC Chair Tom Perez saying ahead of the event that the party shares blacklivesmatter ’s“commitment to justice and hears their demands for change.” When we nominate Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer, we will not miss this moment to ensure those values are reflected in everything we do.

"16 Aug, 2020",America the elites ignore: Driving through US ‘flyover country’ in a time of Covid-19,"The establishment clustered in big coastal cities often derisively refers to the rest of the US as “flyover country.” It’s this area, though, that makes the beating heart of America – as I realized during a recent road trip. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Earlier this month, due to a tragic family event, my wife and I found ourselves on the road to Minnesota from Washington, DC. Normally we would fly, just like most Americans traveling across such distances, but there was no time to make those arrangements. So we drove 1,100 miles across eight states – and back again – within a week. Though the plural of ‘anecdote’ is not ‘data,’ those looking at America strictly through the lens of statistics and models tend to focus on the forest but miss the proverbial trees. With that in mind, here’s some of what we saw along the way. Make of it what you will. Whenever we’d get close to a city, the roads would fill up with vans and small trucks rented by movers. This would track with themounting evidencethat Americans who can afford it are picking up stakes. Whether it’s because of their city or state’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, job opportunities elsewhere, or the collapse of law and order in the wake of“racial justice”protests-turned-riots that broke out at the end of May, I can’t even venture to guess. On the long stretches of highway between cities, we spotted quite a few big trucks used for long-distance moves, too. These big rigs are the actual primary users of the US Interstate Highway System. The 18-wheeler tractor-trailers dominate the US cargo industry, carrying nearly two thirds of all freight. Moreover, most American businesses are structured around the idea of just-in-time delivery, rather than keeping stocks of unsold merchandise. That actually caused massive shortages of certain products at the start of Covid-19 lockdowns in March. Anything that gets in the way of the big rigs, then, spells bad news for the US economy. As we passed them on the road, I recalled a June report from awebsiteserving commercial drivers, saying that four out of five truckers polled would refuse to deliver to cities that defunded their police departments, citing safety concerns. Austin, Texas just voted to cut its police budget by a third. Another dozen cities havealready done so, from New York City and Los Angeles to Baltimore. Portland and Seattle, still plagued by rioters, have cut funding to their police as well. Minneapolis, where the most recent wave of blacklivesmatter protests began in late May over the death of George Floyd, actually voted to abolish its police department entirely! One doesn’t have to be particularly observant to spot a potential problem with this, barreling down the road like an out-of-control tractor-trailer. In most gas stations, restaurants and convenience stores we visited along the way, employees and customers dutifully wore face masks. A few people, locals by the look of them, seemed otherwise inclined. Nobody hassled them or made a scene. Halfway through Illinois, an older gentleman sitting across from us at a burger joint groused about the governor’s tyrannical mask mandates. He was diabetic, he said, so he needed to work out – but just quit his gym membership because they demanded he wear a mask while exercising indoors. His story reminded me of the ongoing saga of a New Jersey gym, which tried reopening in defiance of the governor’s orders, only for its owners to be arrested and their premises boarded up. Later I found out that the state took away their business license – just as Michigan did to a barber that reopened in defiance of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s orders, back in May. The barber was eventually vindicated by the state supreme court. The owners of Atilis Gym are still fighting their fight. Small business owners like these took the brunt of the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns. Others profited from them; many of the big rigs we saw along the way belonged to Amazon, whose stock has skyrocketed as physical stores closed and shopping moved online. Driving halfway across America and back – 2,200 miles, give or take – we saw some evidence of the sentiments along the way by the political signage put up alongside the roads. During the entire trip, we spotted exactly two signs supporting Joe Biden, and at least a dozen supporting President Donald Trump. They ranged from a cargo container parked next to the interstate and used as a canvas, to a hand-written cardboard sign posted at the entrance to a farm. Cars with Trump bumper stickers also vastly outnumbered the near-nonexistent Biden (or Clinton-Kaine) ones, so common in the greater Washington, DC area. More than one person we spoke with also joked that the pandemic will mysteriously vanish on November 4, the day after the election. Oh, the virus is real, they elaborated, but the media and the political establishment have overhyped it for partisan purposes. Looking back on this on Day 150 of“15 days to stop the spread,”I can see where they re coming from. What happens in parts of America we drove through largely doesn’t matter to the NY-LA-DC establishment. Even Minneapolis, where the George Floyd riots started, was quickly forgotten as the“cultural revolution”emerging from them went national. Only a few independent reporters, like Michael Tracey, actually bothered to travel to places devastated by the riots. I m finally home today after two months. A sincere thanks to everyone who made this trip a success!https://t.co/j4L1Heqdtf Yet it is these vast expanses that grow the food the coastal“elites”consume – once in pricey restaurants, now via  high-tech delivery. Though they have happily outsourced much of America’s manufacturing overseas – turning the once-proud industrial states into the Rust Belt – some things required for US global hegemony are still made in the Midwest; we drove past the sprawling M1-Abrams tank plant in Lima, Ohio. This relationship bears an uncanny resemblance to the attitudes of the Capitol toward the Districts in the ‘Hunger Games’ novels. Those were supposed to be a dystopian warning, however, not a roadmap. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"15 Aug, 2020",Radical? Inspirational? A token choice? What s the truth about Kamala Harris?,"Kamala Harris’s appointment as Joe Biden’s vice-presidential running mate has sparked myriad opinions from all along the political spectrum. But what’s true and what’s myth? ByAndrew Dickens, an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. After much rumour and debate, Joe Biden has announced his running mate for this year’s presidential election and… it’s no great surprise. Kamala Harris was named on Tuesday, months after it was known that Biden would pick a female VP candidate. The choice of Harris, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidential nomination, has triggered a huge reaction from all areas of the political playground. From dangerously radical to disappointingly establishment, from inspirationally different to much of the same, people are currently talking more about her than Biden or his opponent, Donald Trump. But is Harris a radical or inspirational choice, in any sense of those words? Is she really that different or is she just like the rest? Which of the things being said about her are true and which aren’t? Here’s a closer look, with some myth-busting and opinion-verifying facts. She represents a radical shift to the left by the Democrats This comes under the myth category, despite Trump claiming that Harris will be“the most radical, far-left vice presidential nominee in US history.” She’s definitely left of most people to run for this office, but far left and radical? Even in conservative US terms, it’s hard to make a case for that. Her voting record puts her to the left of Biden (not too difficult) but not as far as her former rivals for the Democrat presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Economically, she’s pretty much straight down the middle. She doesn’t moot tax increases on the wealthy, so Wall Street types will be happy with her pick –indeed, they’ve said as much. Which means conspiracy theorists shouldn’t expect that ‘Marxist coup’ anytime soon. Her suggested version of Medicare for All, too, was watered down and more accommodating of private medical insurance than others. The bottom line here is that she’s basically a centrist. She’s also seen by many as very ‘establishment’, which can be a curse or a blessing. A blessing if you’re looking to appeal to moderately conservative voters disillusioned by Trump, but a curse if you’re looking to enthral younger, more liberal voters. She’s a soft liberal Probably not true. When she ran for the presidential nomination, she listed several ‘carefully progressive’ rather than radical aims around the legal system. She wanted to legalise cannabis and end the use of private prisons. She also wanted to abolish solitary confinement and the death penalty. She talked of the“failed”system of mass incarceration. Not particularly controversial stuff, and she was never going to appeal to the “hang ’em and flog ’em” brigade, anyway. However, her record as a public prosecutor in California would suggest that she’s not exactly a bleeding heart liberal. Despite criticism for not seeking the death penalty in some high-profile cases, she (ironically) appealed against a court decision that found the state’s death penalty unconstitutional. She also took a hard line on truancy that went as far as fining and even jailing parents if their kids missed enough school. Indeed, her reputation has caused some people to see her closer to law enforcement than the public, particularly in light of the recent blacklivesmatter protests. Whether this helps or hinders Biden is another matter. It’ll probably lose her some social justice points with certain sections but gain some tough justice points elsewhere. And Republicans won’t be able to take easy potshots at her when it comes to law and order. She’s a token appointment Well, this all depends on motive, about which we can only speculate. If Biden’s team decided they wanted a black or female running mate for purely tactical reasons and then decided,""why not have both?"", then that’s tokenism. If they didn’t, then it isn’t. That’s because, either way, Harris is well qualified for the post. As well qualified as most, anyway – she’s been a public prosecutor and a senator, which is about as regular a route to the White House as you can get. She’ll win Biden the black vote Born in Oakland, California, Harris is of black Jamaican and Indian parentage. The first thought that came to some minds, therefore, was that she’d help Biden win a ‘minority majority’. Actually, despite his best efforts to alienate them with some bizarre recent comments about black people who contemplate voting for Trump over him not “being black”, and the black community being less “diverse” than the Latino community, and despite a divisive record on race relations in his early career, Biden is still very popular with African-American voters. In fact, in the race for the nomination, they favoured him over Harris. So, having a black running mate probably won’t make Biden any enormous gains. However, it might improve voter turn-out and possibly get him enough ticks on the ballot to avoid Hillary Clinton’s crucial loss of support from that demographic in the 2016 election. What’s less clear is how her popularity among the growing South Asian vote will affect the bigger picture. She’ll win Biden the female vote Black female voters are the most loyal Democrats around so that demographic doesn’t need much persuading. But what about women in general? Far more of them vote in elections than men (there are more of them in total, after all) which is why Biden was always going to pick a woman as a running mate. It’s hard to know if Harris will win votes simply by being a woman, but if she does, those votes have to be in all the right places. Hillary Clinton took 59 percent of the female vote in 2016, compared to 39 percent for Trump and, while she comfortably won the popular vote, that didn’t translate into power, as Trump took the White House. She and Biden don’t get on “When she said things during the Democratic primary debates that were horrible about Sleepy Joe, I would think you would not have picked her,”Trump said, failing to see the irony. In fact, he said she was“nastier than Pocahontas”, reviving his racist nickname for Warren. As you d expect in a debate, mud was slung between the two rivals. As you’d expect, this mud will now be portrayed as water under the bridge. However, the one sod that might not wash off is the one that got turned into T-shirts. In an effort to dent Biden’s popularity with African-American voters, Harris accused Biden of past opposition to ‘bussing’ - a policy introduced to racially integrate public schools. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,”Harris said, before delivering the killer line:“That little girl was me.” She later endorsed Biden for president, however, and though they might not be pals, it seems unlikely that Biden would pick someone with serious beef against him. That said, the public might take some convincing, and Republicans certainly won’t let it lie. She will want a pro-environment campaign Without doubt. We’re not talking Extinction Rebellion levels, but Harris’s policies and track record will add environmental weight to Biden’s campaign. As District Attorney in San Francisco, she formed an environmental justice unit aimed at investigating eco-crimes that affected low-income people. As Attorney General of California, she took on ExxonMobil and Chevron. She also refused donations from gas and oil companies when running for the presidential nomination. Her environmental policies in that race were centred around the Green New Deal and her pledge to see it passed, even if it meant getting rid of the filibuster to do so. “From wildfires in the West to hurricanes in the East, to floods and droughts in the heartland, we’re not gonna buy the lie,”she said when launching her campaign.“We’re gonna act based on science fact, not science fiction.” In short, she has green credentials but isn’t seen as radical. Thegrowing importance of eco issueswith US voters could make putting her name on the ticket a smart move. She’s an historical choice You can’t really argue with this. Only two women in US history have previously been appointed as presidential running mates by a major party – Geraldine Ferraro (D) in 1984 and Sarah Palin (R) in 2008 – and Harris is the first VP candidate from a minority background. So, firsts have been achieved, barriers broken and so on. Will her getting the job lead to the kind of social and political change that goes down in history? With her fairly middle-of-the-road views, that’s much more debatable. She’s an inspirational choice Again, it depends what Biden’s looking for. If he’s looking for someone to upset the Republicans, then you could make the claim that she’s a smart choice. The stream of abuse since her appointment, much of it racial and misogynistic, and some of it coming from Trump, proves she’s feared on the right. Trump has even launched one of hisfalse ‘birther’ conspiracies. The panic has set in, for sure, but was she the only running mate who could have achieved this effect? Maybe. Maybe not. If we’re being literal, as the first woman of either black or South Asian heritage to get this far up the US political food chain (and only the fourth woman at all, when you include Hillary Clinton), then she could well inspire a lot of people who might find, or think of, themselves as marginalised. But that’s not Biden’s concern – he’s all about November. However, if we’re talking about a radical, out-of-the-box, left-field, Trump-slaying masterstroke by Team Biden, then it’s a no. Her differences are mainly symbolic, which isn’t to belittle them, but dig deeper and you’ll find a solid centrist politician, albeit one with seemingly few skeletons in her closet (not that such things seem to be a barrier to success these days). This doesn’t make her a bad choice – she’s a very good operator who’s already battle-hardened after the nomination debates and clearly gets the Republican goat, and it’s arguable who else would have been better. But inspirational isn’t the word. She’s different but notthatdifferent. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"14 Aug, 2020",Kamala Harris is not a ‘left radical’ or a ‘Marxist’. I wish she were,"Within moments of Joe Biden announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate, the Trump campaign and the American right-wing propaganda machine began portraying the California senator as a “far-left radical” of the “Marxist” variety. ByPaul Street,the author of numerous books, including They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy (Routledge, 2014) and The Empire s New Clothes: Barack Obama in the Real World of Power (Routledge, 2011). Paul Street’s latest book isHollow Resistance: Obama, Trump, and the Politics of Appeasement(CounterPunch Books, September 2020). Follow Paul on Twitter@Streetwriter17 There’s nothing wrong with being a leftist (I am one), but the charge (I might say compliment) is ludicrous and undeserved. Harris has long been firmly lodged on the right wing of the democraticparty , which Richard Nixon’s former strategist Kevin Phillips accuratelydescribedas“history’s second most enthusiastic capitalist party.” As both a Bay Area prosecutor (1990–2003) and California Attorney General (2003–2016), the Big Business-backed Harris earned a reputation as a friend of the police and an agent of racially disparate mass incarceration. She boasted of her high felony conviction rates, achieved with significant violations of defendant rights. She fought back any attempts to change California’s vicious prison system, institute a criminal justice reform and abolish the death penalty. She even resisted a court order to release low-risk inmates by arguing that it could cost California an important source of cheap labor to be used, at risk to their lives, to fight wildfires for $2 a day. She was hardly the “progressive prosecutor” she claimed to have been when announcing her presidential candidacy in 2019. Anyone who thinks ‘Copmala’ Harris was a criminal justice ‘progressive’ should watch ashort TED-style talkshe gave on behalf of racist mass incarceration at the Chicago Ideas Week conference in 2015. One really must take in her derisive voice and body language as she launched into a scornful attack on reformers’ supposedly naïve call to move taxpayer money from mass imprisonment to education: “We all have these posters [sarcastic posture] in our closet [pained look on face] that is attached to a stick that we sometimes will cart out when we’re talking about criminal justice ... and we run around with these signs [disdainful face] ... ‘Build More Schools, Less Jails! Build More Schools, Less Jails!’ And we walk around everywhere – ‘Build More Schools!’ We protest [mocking face, hand pretending to hold up a placard] ... ‘Put money into education, not prisons!’ [loud mocking squeaky voice]. There’s a fundamental problem with that approach, in my opinion. And it’s this:...You have not addressed the reason I have three padlocks on my front door.” Attorney General Harris and her multimillionaire white husband had “three padlocks on [their] front door” because the class rule and racial oppression system she spent her adult life serving and protecting had reached such stunning levels of savage inequality that the top tenth of the American One Percent possessed as much combined wealth as the nation’s bottom 90 percent while the median householdblack-white wealth gaphad reached six black cents on the white dollar. These disparities were only worsened by the giant racist mass arrest and incarceration regime that she and her future presidential running mateJoe ‘Three Strikes’ Bidendid so much to advance. During her very brief stint (2017 – present) in the Republican-controlled US Senate, Harris has tried to develop aprogressive personaby speaking on behalf of liberal causes such as immigration reform, marijuana legalization and increased pay for schoolteachers. She scored more points with liberals by aggressively questioning Trump’s right-wing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In her disastrous and prematurely concluded presidential campaign, Harris clumsily tried to play the great game of Americans politics –“the manipulation of populism by elitism”(Christopher Hitchens) – by inauthentically posing as a candidate of “the people.”  She briefly took up Bernie Sanders’ call for “Medicare for All” but then reversed herself on ending private health insurance in favor of a federally financed system. She promised to protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients from deportation and opposed Trump’s border wall with Mexico, but, tellingly,failed to voteagainst Trump’s network of immigrant detention camps along the US-Mexico border. She backs a boosting of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but says nothing about how such an increase would leave millions of workers poor while ineligible for food stamps, housing subsidies and Medicaid. Harris has also been a big player in the Democrats’ Russiagate campaign, demanding Trump’s impeachment, not for his chilling violations of the US Constitution or his nativist persecution of immigrants, but for being an alleged Russian “stooge.” That has earned her points from the US national security establishment. Vice presidential candidate Harris will make no calls for a real Green New Deal, genuinely progressive taxation, or single-payer health insurance (Medicare for All), which the arch-corporatist Biden says he would veto – this, even though single-payer isbacked by seven in 10Americans. Biden chose her because she will be safely on board with the corporate agenda while her deceptive progressive pretension and her nonwhite and female identity cloak her loyalty to an American System run by and for the mostly white corporate, financial, and imperial establishment. It’s an old game in American politics: Democrats posing as populists and progressives when they’re owned by the nation’s imperial ruling class. The Republicans are also playing an old game: absurdly labelling corporate and imperial Democrats “totalitarian,” “radical leftists,” “Marxists,” “socialists,” and “communists.” From the New Deal (1932–1940) on, not a single Democratic president or presidential contender (no matter how militantly corporate, imperial, and anti-communist/-socialist), has escaped this“paranoid-style”charge from the American right. (The deeply conservative Barack Obama was ludicrously described as a “socialist,” a “Marxist,” and even a “Marxist-Leninist” by the Tea Party right, even as he governed in strict accord with the interests of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and the military-industrial Pentagon System.) It’s a bit harder than usual for the right to make the neo-McCarthyite charge stick on Biden.  He’s an old and conservative, racially problematic white man with a long congressional and vice-presidential record as anabject warmonger and a tool of the corporate class. Things are different with Harris. As a more recent arrival on the national stage, a product of the supposedly radical San Francisco Bay area, and a black female, Harris is much easier to sell to the Republicans’ disproportionately rural, white, and male voting and street-fighting base as a radical, big-city threat. It’s all very ironic. As with Obama, Harris’s identity attributes help conceal her captivity to the capitalist profits system that the right religiously supports. At the same time, as neither of the two major US parties will ever admit, the United States could use a good dose of the socialism that Kamala Harris and other top Democrats are absurdly accused of supporting. Like something straight out of, well, Marx, the nation’s capitalist ruling class is grinding the American ‘democratic’ experiment into arch-plutocratic dust, rendering longstanding majority-progressive public opinion irrelevant while wealth and power concentrate yet further upwards, and millions of ordinary Americans are thrown out of work, off health insurance, and into poverty and misery in the middle of an epic pandemic.

"12 Aug, 2020",Wanna bet? US statisticians give Trump ‘exact same odds’ against Biden as the ones he beat in 2016,"The major statistical analysis website FiveThirtyEight has US President Donald Trump’s odds of winning the November election at 29 percent – exactly the same chances he was said to have had in 2016 before he went on to win. Nate Silver’s website, named for the total number of electors in the US electoral college, unveiled its forecast,basedon 40 thousand simulations, on Wednesday. Democrat Joe Biden came out the overwhelming theoretical victor, with a 71 percent chance of getting into the Oval Office. Biden’s formidable performance in the renowned agency’s modeling, combined with the comfortablepollinglead he’s been enjoying for months, might seem to spell doom for Trump’s campaign. Silver himself noted it probably doesn’t, however. “Coincidentally, these are the exact same odds as in our final forecast in 2016,”he tweeted, adding that while Trump’s eventual win went against most professional predictions, FiveThirtyEight was one of the few outlets that did not completely write off the current president. Coincidentally, these are the exact same odds as in our final forecast in 2016!!! (Clinton 71%, Trump 29%)As was also the case in 2016, our model gives Trump a MUCH higher chance than other statistical models. “It’s way too soon to count Trump out,”says Silver in anarticledetailing his forecast.“If the election were held today, [Biden] might even win in a landslide,”he said, adding“but the election is not being held today.” Historically, it’s been common for polls to shift“fairly radically”from mid-August to Election Day, Silver noted, and no model can predict the unpredictable, from the Covid-19 pandemic and the possible development of the vaccine to the ongoing blacklivesmatter protests. In 2016, multiple prominent analysts concluded there was a 99 percent chance of Hillary Clinton becoming president. Since her loss, much of the faith in polling and modeling of any kind seems to have been shaken, as Trump himself oftenspeaksabout“fake polls”while reminding Americans he’s overcome the odds once already.

NY Times tried to ‘debunk’ it with actual FAKE NEWS,"Mainstream media have denounced RT’s Ruptly video agency for documenting Portland protesters burning Bibles, dismissing the unaltered footage as ‘Russian disinfo’ in an attempt at bad-faith ‘shoot the messenger’ gaslighting. Protesters gather around a burning Bible, chanting“F*** Trump,”as they neatly drape an American flag over the flames. A few of the demonstrators rub their hands over the tiny fire, aping warming themselves as the flames devour the book. The 90-second clip was part of a 4-hour livestream. It’s an incendiary image (no pun intended) – protesters already denounced from some corners as anti-American taking aim at beloved national and religious symbols – but Ruptly didn’t attempt to interpret the video beyond explaining the events took place on the 65th day of protests, after federal agents had left the courthouse. The images speak for themselves. But according to the New York Times, the video’s rapid spread through social media and the conservative infosphere was not the organic result of its newsworthy content that appeared to support their political beliefs – it was instead a deliberate Kremlin propaganda campaign,“one of the first viral Russian disinformation hits of the 2020 presidential campaign.” How Russia amplified a misleading story about the Portland protests and how it spread in American media.@AllMattNYTand I take a dive into the world of disinfo.https://t.co/EU5nxEVCM0 The Times doesn’t explicitly accuse the Ruptly photographer of faking the video, but the outlet does everything else it can to cast the clip’s authenticity into doubt –“the truth,”the paper insists,“was far more mundane”than the outpouring of dramatic headlines would have one believe. Not only was the fire“far from the main action of the protest,”the Times wrote, claiming this was obvious from how the footage“looks and sounds,”but the act itself was hardly the shocking display it’s been presented as:“A few protesters among the many thousands appear to have burned a single Bible – and possibly a second – for kindling to start a bigger fire.” Anything beyond that, they suggested, was Russian disinfo, and the conservative commentators who“took the bait”and ran with the story are useful idiots misled by those notorious sowers of division. Case closed? This simplistic morality play raises more questions than it answers, starting with“how many Bibles is it considered acceptable to burn during a ‘peaceful’ protest?” Ruptly s footage was unaltered, and its original title –“Portland demonstrators set Bible and US flag alight on 65th night of protests”– is merely a straightforward description of the video’s contents. The video description is no more speculative than the title, and a media agency (no matter where it’s based) can hardly be blamed for what viewers read into its footage. Far from“disinfo,”Ruptly has accrued a total of 1,900 minutes of live footage from Portland between the end of July and the start of August, showing all aspects of the demonstrations. One viral clip taken from the live coverageshowsfederal agents tackling a woman and pinning her to the ground. The video racked up 5.2 million views. It was conservative social media provocateur Ian Miles Cheong who claimed“left wing activists”had brought“a stack of Bibles”for a religious-themed bonfire in front of the Portland courthouse – a claim that was then picked up by everyone from Republican Senator Ted Cruz to Donald Trump Jr. But that doesn’t matter to the Times: all subsequent coverage was fruit of a poisonous (Russian) tree. Left-wing activists bring a stack of Bibles to burn in front of the federal courthouse in Portland.https://t.co/lYWY0x8n8P Except Ruptly wasn’t the only agency to film the incident. The New York Postgot its own shotof the burning bible and flag, and local CBS affiliate KOINwroteabout the burning Bible on a live newsfeed of the protest before Ruptly had even posted the clip. It’s no longer rare to see mainstream media running interference for antifa protesters when they commit disturbing acts. Buzzfeed wrote alengthy defenseof a blacklivesmatter “raid”on Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, explaining the pastor’s“bigoted”views in detail and implying they justified the horde of shouting demonstrators laying waste to the house of worship. Oh, and RT retweeted the footage, so that story is disinformation, too. Self-styled propaganda experts and academics have been low-key lobbying – through misuse of the term inacademic papersand morally-bankrupt“experiments”– to redefine“disinformation”itself as“facts arranged to serve a purpose”by governments the US doesn’t like, and mainstream media have eagerly latched on to this new definition. As a result – and with the US election just months away – the message matters less every day. It’s the messenger that determines whether something can be trusted.

"11 Aug, 2020",Trump launches scathing ad on ‘phony’ Kamala Harris as Democrats are torn over Biden’s VP pick,"President Donald Trump is having a field day with the choice of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s running mate. While Democrat elites are rallying behind the ticket, frustrated progressives point to her problematic prosecutorial past. DemocratsannouncedHarris as Biden’s running mate on Tuesday, proving right theJuly scoopfrom Politico based on a leaked campaign email. The California senator of Jamaican and Indian descent was quickly embraced by the party establishment as the perfect fit. Failed 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton said she was“thrilled to welcome Kamala Harris to a historic Democratic ticket.” I m thrilled to welcome@KamalaHarristo a historic Democratic ticket. She s already proven herself to be an incredible public servant and leader. And I know she’ll be a strong partner to@JoeBiden. Please join me in having her back and getting her elected.pic.twitter.com/cmtOO8Gqqv “Thrilled”was also the choice phrase of Stacey Abrams, failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate rumored to be in the running for the VP slot until Harris was announced. My full statement:pic.twitter.com/U9SiSiniag Another endorsement came from Alexander Soros, son and heir of the Democrat mega-donor George Soros, congratulating Harris as“our future vice president”next to a photo of them shaking hands. Congratulations to our future Vice President@KamalaHarris! History in the making!#VPPick#BidenHarris2020pic.twitter.com/1erAGp6vt8 The Lincoln Project – former Republican strategists now eagerly working to get Biden elected out of their hatred of Trump – was also thrilled about the choice of Harris, quickly rolling out a video message. Kamala. It’s time. Let’s go.pic.twitter.com/ZsZVrIiofY Progressive firebrand Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) was also on board, declaring that the former prosecutor“understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history.” Congratulations to@KamalaHarris, who will make history as our next Vice President. She understands what it takes to stand up for working people, fight for health care for all, and take down the most corrupt administration in history. Let’s get to work and win. While Sanders bent the knee, other progressives were not convinced. “Nothing says blacklivesmatter like the one-two carceral punch of Joe ‘Crime Bill’ Biden and Kamala ‘School or Jail’ Harris,”tweeted Shadowproof editor Kevin Gosztola, pointing out the irony of a Biden-Harris ticket as a way for Democrats to“honor the legacy of George Floyd,”the African-American man whose death at the hands of police in Minnesota started weeks of riots across the US. Nothing says blacklivesmatter like the one-two carceral punch of Joe ""Crime Bill"" Biden and Kamala ""School or Jail"" Harris Harris got her start in politics as a district attorney in California, becoming the state attorney general in 2011 before getting elected to the Senate in 2016. Her prosecutorial record got her labeled a“cop”by progressive Democrats now campaigning to defund or abolish the police. President Trump reacted to the announcement by releasing an attack ad arguing that“phony”Harris was rejected by Democrat voters long before the primaries began, but Biden is just“not smart”enough to do the same. pic.twitter.com/jXoffXyZed At a press conference later on Tuesday, the president said he was“a little surprised”by Biden’s choice, calling Harris his“number-one draft pick” thanks to a “very, very [poor]”primary performance.“She was expected to do well; she ended up at right around two percent,”he said.

"11 Aug, 2020",Seattle’s 1st black female chief RESIGNS after city council chops police budget & officers’ salaries,"Seattle police chief Carmen Best has announced her resignation following a city vote to slash law enforcement budgets, including her own salary. Best, who was on the force for 28 years, described the cuts as “punitive.” Seattle’s city council approved legislation to enact significant cuts in a 7-1 vote on Monday, which will eliminate some $4 million from the police department’s $400 million yearly budget, including a sizable reduction of $800,000 to the PD’s recruitment spending. Among other measures, the 2020 budget package will also cap Best’s salary at $275,000, reduced from $294,000. Chief Best has been vocal in her opposition to those cuts, and told me in an interview today that she felt targeted by a ""punitive"" proposal to cut her pay by 40%: ""I do feel like it s ... animus toward me specifically."" Hours after the vote, local media were inundated with reports that Best, the city’s first black and female police chief, was stepping down. She confirmed the news in a letter to the Seattle Police Department on Monday evening, saying that her resignation would be effective from September 2. #BREAKING: This is the full e-mail Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best sent to the entire Seattle Police Department at 9:32 tonight, stating she’ll be retiring from SPD, effective September 2nd, 2020. She writes, “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served as your chief.”pic.twitter.com/bEM0VOllw8 Best did not reveal in the letter what prompted her to end her career with the SPD. However,  local media linked the move to the budget cuts, citing sources close to the chief. While the cuts will also see up to 100 officers laid off from the force by November and a $150,000 pay cap for command staff, they fall far short of the 50 percent cut sought by some activists, who have been vocal in demanding to see the SDP defunded following the police killing of George Floyd in late May. Among those calling for a more radical proposal is councilmember Kshama Sawant – the lone dissenter in Monday’s vote – who insisted the cuts did not go far enough, arguing“this budget fails working people.” Best’s attorney, Anne Bremner, previously argued that the police chief was being targeted with retaliation over past criticisms of the city council, alleging that lawmakers had moved against her in secret. “[Best] and Jenny Durkan gave a press conference where they were critical of the council. In my view, this was retaliation because as soon as they did that, the council – in a vote that was not publicized, that was not on the agenda publicly – voted to reduce her salary,”Bremner told a local news outlet. Critics have already weighed in on the reports, with one local journalist calling the move“surreal,”while suggesting the city council had“[chased] off a police chief, a Seattle veteran, and a woman of color.”Others noted the irony that the fight against ‘white supremacy’ had forced a black woman out of her job. It seems surreal the@SeattleCouncil, which met via ZOOM, on a remote basis......could chase off a Police Chief, a Seattle veteran, & a woman of color, who was *in* the streets on near daily basis.Debate funding. Debate tactics. You can t debate how surreal that seems. the fight against white supremacy leads to a black woman having to quit her jobwanna see this explained https://t.co/OfIuvggElU Seattle s first black police chief is resigning after the city council quite randomly cut her pay and then let anarchists repeatedly surround her househttps://t.co/cUppqHcZxm Seattle has been wracked by months of intermittent protests following Floyd’s death, seeing activists take over a section of the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood earlier this summer and transform it into a protester encampment dubbed ‘CHOP,’ or the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest. The zone was shut down in July following a string of fatal shootings, however protests have carried on since, at times seeing clashes between officers and demonstrators.

"6 Aug, 2020","Biden says Latinos are ‘incredibly diverse,’ UNLIKE BLACK VOTERS","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took time out from a question asked by a Latina reporter to state that while black voters all think alike (with “notable exceptions”), Latino voters are “incredibly diverse” in opinion. In the midst of answering a question on whether he would extend protected status for Venezuelan immigrants during a Wednesday town hall, Biden veered off on a self-congratulatory tangent touting his supposed knowledge of the Latino community. What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things. While Biden clarified that he was referring to differences in opinion on immigration between Latinos living in Florida and those living in Arizona, writing off all black voters as being ideologically in lockstep sounded more than a little offensive, especially in the era of blacklivesmatter . Throughout my career I ve witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It s this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place. However, the reporter asking him the question, NPR’s Lulu Garcia-Navarro, didn’t bat an eyelash, instead moving on to ask Biden if he planned to tear down the segments of border wall President Donald Trump had constructed. Biden’s reflection on Latinos triggered a wave of reaction on Thursday, but it was far from the only head-scratcher in the town hall. The candidate also attacked a reporter who asked whether he’d take a cognitive test, arguing: “That’s like saying you, before you got on this program, you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?” But while that exchange was covered in mainstream media, Biden’s “black people all think alike” moment went largely unremarked-upon outside the conservative media sphere. Social media users wouldn’t let him get away with it, however, with many calling the former VP out – orwondering“Why is Biden making the comparison between Latinos and blacks in the first place?” Yikes; Joe Biden said that Latinos differ from Blacks because they hold a variety of diverse opinions about many different things. (Blacks are conformist sheep and too dumb to have their own opinions?) what he’s saying is: We Control Blacks Translation: We (Democrats) already own the blacks mind, body, and soul. Others tried to reinterpret the statement, but still ended up with a racist generalization He s saying that it s a handful of exceptions and that s why it s notable. He s talking about the prominent black conservatives like@ThomasSowell@larryelder@SecretaryCarson, etc. The rest of us are all the same. The question is ""Why is he always ""accidentally"" insulting us? …or got savaged by Trump fans for making excuses for the Democrat. Oh so, as a whole group, black people are all same. A few special blacks stand out but that s it? Lol you did NOT clarify nor improve upon his statement, dear.#madeitworse ""notable exceptions"" translates to ""few and far between"". And many observed it wasn t exactly Biden s first rodeo regarding questionable statements about black people. The candidate infamously told black voters - via an interview with Breakfast Club host Charlamagne Tha God - that if they had a problem choosing between himself and Trump in November, ""you ain t black."" The notable exceptions of the African American community are those that ""ain t black"". Why isn’t@joebidenbeing called a racist? He actually is. He gave himself away. He has no respect for the black community. He doesn’t have to work for the black vote. Why WOULD he have respect for the black community?@TxBornSooner@MontySisco1 Already prone to inappropriate statements charitably deemed “gaffes,” Biden is especially inclined to jam his foot in his mouth regarding black voters, many of whom nevertheless turned out to support him in the primaries. He has accordingly milked his service as VP under Barack Obama, the first (and so far only) black American president, and has promised to nominate a woman of color as his vice president.

"6 Aug, 2020",Michelle Obama’s ‘low grade depression’ may very well be real but framing it politically smacks of attention seeking point scoring,"The former First Lady claims that her ennui has been brought on by a variety of things including the pandemic, racial issues in America, and the “hypocrisy” of the Trump administration. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Mrs Obama says she is suffering from“low grade depression”, coincidentally she also has a new podcast to promote but we’ll leave that to one side for now. Her assessment could simply be filed along with the raft of other statements from ludicrously privileged people whinging about how hard it has been to be stuck in their mansions. What they of course mean is that people aren’t paying nearly as much attention to them as they used to because they have real things to deal with. No doubt the pandemic has somewhat scuppered Michelle’s plans to develop her media career. But I feel like her complaint is more pernicious than the average celebrity moan. Firstly, a woman of her intelligence should know better than to bandy the term “depression” around quite so liberally. Obviously, she may feel she is in a low mood, but from the way she has described her “depression” it certainly doesn’t fall into the category of a psychiatric issue. At a time when millions of Americans are isolated at home or feel legitimately unsafe in their own cities (not everyone has a Secret Service detail, Michelle) this is a tin-eared statement. But even ignoring that, her assessment about the state of America is such a bien-pensant and obvious a metro-lefty one it borders on asinine. This would be irritating if it came from who she is on her own merit, a successful liberal lawyer, but coming from someone whose husband ran the bloody country for eight years it makes you wonder if she was paying attention. She must know that no one would give hoot what she thinks about anything if she hadn’t been married to the president, so the least she could do is offer something more insightful than a mediocre sitcom actress. It also completely ignores both her own and her husband’s contribution to the febrile situation in the USA. I appreciate it is an election year and she is Democratic royalty, but little of what she has said or done has done much to inspire unity. Rather than opting to be a voice of sanity in her party she, like most other senior Democrats is bowing to the outer left fringes of the party. This is allowing the party of people like JFK, Clinton and even her husband, who though left by American standards was still moderate, to be taken over by radicals likeAlexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omarwho are seriously calling for the defunding of police forces. She also appears to buy completely into the narrative that America is a systemically racist country despite her own family being a clear refutation of this. What sort of white supremacist nation would elect a black president, twice, and then lap up the books, tv, shows and podcasts promoted by his wife? The answer is of course that that wouldn’t happen in a white supremacist country, or indeed any country that cleaves as strongly to racial identity as the blacklivesmatter movement does itself and imagines others do as well. There are a great many people out there who are probably a lot more than “low grade depressed” about the state of things for the exact opposite reason. I for one am greatly disheartened by the re-racialisation of Western politics that has spread across the world thanks to hardcore activists in America. My own country of Britain has imported wholesale the divisive politics of blacklivesmatter and its cheerleaders like Al Sharpton and Ayanna Pressley when our nation is immeasurably different to the USA. We’ve seen the ridiculous spectacle of blacklivesmatter leaders in OxfordLARPing as Black Panthersand even a group dressing up as some kind of bizarre Black Power militia group marching through London. This should be deeply worrying to anyone who professes any hope for racial harmony. Obviously, one expects a Democrat like Mrs Obama to heap blame on a Republican President like Trump, particularly during an election year. Michelle cites the president’s “hypocrisy” as another cause for her angst. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what she means by this hypocrisy, but in fairness no one can seriously argue that Trump is above reproach. But surely the fact that the only viable alternative is Joe Biden is surely equal cause for upset? Her husband’s old VP hasn’t exactly been inspiring confidence with his all too in frequent public appearances. Normally at this stage of an election year one can’t get the candidates off the screen whereas trying to get Biden on a show seems to be more difficult than coxing a badger out of its set. However, on the rare occasions his team reluctantly agree to put him on camera, it is not difficult to see why they want to keep him locked up. Every appearance seems to result in him making somebizarre gaff, like telling black Trump voters they “ain’t” black or forgetting what state he is in (I knowVermont and New Hampshireare close Mr Vice President, but really?). And then there is the pandemic. Plainly this has affected virtually everyone on the planet but not in the same way. Michelle says the pandemic has left her feeling “powerless”, I would venture that pandemic or not, that is a feeling every former occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue feels after they vacate the property. But despite not having the ear of the president anymore, she is by most standards and incredibly powerful figure. She is a bestselling author, a podcast host, pre-Covid she sold out arenas on a book tour and Netflix can hardly write checks to her family fast enough for any project they wish to work on. What of those people who have been robbed of their ability to work by the outbreak and the lockdowns? What of those whose businesses that have been destroyed in Democrat run cities across the US thanks to rioting endorsed by your side of the aisle? That is real powerlessness. Obviously, anyone from any walk of life can suffer from depression, I know that from my own experiences. But these interjections from immensely privileged people frequently serve to trivialise the condition and couching them in political issues, to my mind, just seems like a cheap way to score points and sympathy, especially when they are presented in such a one-sided fashion. Perhaps I am expecting too much from the former First Lady in hoping she would be above such things, but one can’t help feeling that a woman of her clear intellectual substance should really be saying something, well, more substantial.

"6 Aug, 2020", I m just going to act responsibly : Nick Kyrgios admits he s UNLIKELY to play at the French Open due to COVID-19 concerns,"Australian tennis ace Nick Kyrgios has cited concerns about the continued safety issues surrounding COVID-19 as he revealed that he is unlikely to play at the French Open this year. Kyrgios announced his withdrawal from the U.S. Open on Sunday, and revealed to Australian TV station Channel Nine that he intends to wait until the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic is safer and more stable before he commits to playing tournaments in Europe. ""It s a very slim chance I ll play in Europe. Almost slim to none, to be honest,""he admitted. ""I m going to use this (time) to stay home, train, be with my family, be with my friends and I m just going to act responsibly, and wait till I think there s better circumstances to play."" The French Open at Roland Garros was set to take place at its usual timeslot at the end of May and beginning of June, but the advent of the coronavirus meant the tournament was postponed to September. But Kyrgios, who withdrew from the 2019 tournament due to sickness after claiming the tournament ""sucks,"" looks likely to be a notable absentee in 2020. Before attention turns to Roland Garros, however, the U.S. Open will take place behind closed doors at Flushing Meadows between August 13 and September 13. Already confirmed as missing from the field are Kyrgios, plus world No. 2 Rafael Nadal and women s world No. 1 Ash Barty. Kyrgios said the decision to withdraw from the U.S. Open was a straightforward one. ""Even with the ( blacklivesmatter ) movement and the whole protests and that type of stuff going on over there, I just don t think at the moment it s the correct time to go ahead with sport, in my opinion,""he said. There are also concerns over the status of next year s Australian Open, with a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 in Melbourne placing the city into a second lockdown and raising an element of doubt over the running of the first Grand Slam of 2021. Plans are in place for the tournament to go ahead, even if it means doing so behind closed doors, but Kyrgios admitted he s unsure about the viability of the tournament in the current climate. ""With the pandemic in Melbourne, I heard on the radio today I think 700 new cases, we reached new heights in deaths,""he said. ""I m not sure the Australian Open will go on.""

The raid on Paul’s Calabasas residence was captured in photos and videos that circulated on social media. The officers were seen carrying a number of rifles out of the mansion. The FBI has raided the Calabasas mansion of YouTuber Jake Paul. The raid is in connection to Paul’s involvement in a looting at an Arizona mall. Multiple firearms were removed from the residence.No arrests are currently planned.pic.twitter.com/se4AVgqSHl Paul was charged in June with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly after appearing in a video at a mall in Scottsdale, Arizona, near Phoenix, where protesters were seen vandalizing and looting stores. While police in Scottsdale have clarified that those charges have since been dropped, they said a federal probe is ongoing. “It has been decided that in the cases charging Jake Paul, Arman Izadi and Andrew Leon, it is in the best interest of the community to dismiss misdemeanor charges without prejudice so that a federal criminal investigation can be completed,”the police said in a statement on Wednesday, referring to two others who had been charged alongside Paul. I was one of the few who pointed out that when Jake Paul went to a mall while it was being looted he did so comfortably making videos because he was accompanied with men holding rifles.

Paul’s attorney has acknowledged Wednesday’s raid, saying his client intended to cooperate with the investigation and that his legal team is“still gathering information”on the incident.

"5 Aug, 2020",Picnics and celebrity weddings are the latest to be added to the ever-growing list of things that are racist. Pass the sick bucket,"According to disingenuous race hustlers the simple act of eating outdoors is evocative of lynching and Ryan Reynolds getting married at a old plantation glamorises slavery. How is anyone taking this nonsense seriously? Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Picnics are the latest activity to have the shadow of racism cast across them by the perpetually offended, who must devote inordinate amounts of their waking hours searching for new “outrages” to be outraged about. The theory behind why the simple act of eating outdoors may be an act of white supremacy apparently stems from the fact that terrible people in old Dixie sometimes had picnics at lynchings. According to Treva Lindsey, an associate professor of women’s studies at Ohio State University, “The word, picnic, carries with it the memory that there was a time when white folks gathered to eat outside, burning black flesh would be on the menu.” This is palpably insane. Is professor Lindseyseriously suggestingthat saying “picnic” immediately transports black people back to the antebellum South like something out of a Jordan Peele horror movie? Is she arguing that people of colour are reminded of their ancestors being brutally murdered if they see a white family enjoying an al fresco sandwich? Does the song “Teddy Bears Picnic” need to be consigned to the dustbin of history along with “Deutschland Uber Alles”? Apparently, the facts that the termderives from the French phrasepique-nique,and first appeared in English in aletter fromLord Chesterfieldin 1748,and has absolutely nothing to do with race whatsoever doesn’t matter. Neither does the fact that most picnics in the history of picnicking had nothing to do with lynching. No, what matters is that some racist people did something and now that thing is itself racist. This is a ridiculous way to view the world. There is a worrying tendency these days to view certain things in the worst possible light. Like in this instance, all the picnics that had nothing to do with racial murder are now viewed through the prism of those that were. But why would we allow the worst people who did something to own that act or activity when it is, in reality, completely neutral? If it is argued that picnics, or the use of the word, are to go the way of the dodo because they occasionally happened near lynchings, what else is to end up on that list? Rope? Trees? White sheets? All these things are only offensive in a certain, very specific context, and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. If we were to expand it beyond the remit of slavery and Jim Crow then all manner of things could become problematic, virtually every German company still going that existed before 1933 would surely be on the list for starters. In a similar vein, there is now a fad for apologising for using things that were once associated with some centuries old sin. Just this week actor Ryan Reynolds felt the need to apologise for his choice of wedding venue because it was on an old plantation. When the Deadpool star tied the knot with Gossip Girl’s Blake Lively in 2012 they chose a stunning South Carolina mansion calledBoone Hall. The settlement itself has been a working plantation since 1681 and remains one to this day. The hall, in which the Reynolds’ got hitched, is a colonial revival house that was built in 1936. Obviously, architecture is a matter of taste and opinion, but I’d wager most couples would be thrilled with it as a place to wed. It appears that eight years ago Mr and Mrs Reynolds did enjoy their big day and no one had a problem with it at the time, but then 2012 was a few years before the world went woke. Apparently, Reynoldsfirst got grieffor having his wedding at Boone Hall after he tweeted praise for the movie Black Panther in 2018. Your guess is as good as mine as to why his choice of wedding venue is in any way relevant to him liking a movie about a superhero from a fictional country, but I digress. This viral bout of rage clearly fizzled out quickly and probably would have stayed that way ifFast Companyhadn’t decided they wanted to score some woke points. Reynolds has given an interview to the September issue of this magazine, in which his interviewer raises the topic of his wedding venue, or, as Fast Company calls it, his“complicated personal history”. He tells us that the actor was forced to confront this“complicated history”again after the death of George Floyd, because obviously a Hollywood wedding that took place eight years ago is inexorably linked to a death in police custody in May 2020. We are told that the Deadpool star is“still clearly pained by the hurt the wedding caused, as well as by his own lack of judgment.”Reynolds himself describes it as variously“something we’ll always be deeply and unreservedly sorry for”,“impossible to reconcile”and“a giant f***ing mistake”. From those statements anyone would think that he’d had a slavery themed wedding officiated by a klansman. But he didn’t, he had a small and very private wedding, the couple didn’t publicise it, there weren’t splashes in Vogue or Hello! Magazine and, obviously, its connection to slavery was not why they chose the venue. They chose it because they liked the look of it, as did the director of the 2004 filmThe Notebookin which Boone Hall featured. Why is this anyone else’s business? The biggest problem with all of this nonsense is that I don’t believe any of the parties involved are sincere. I do not believe there are people who see picnicking families in the park and immediately think of someone stringing up a runaway slave. I do not believe that people were genuinely offended by a Hollywood actor’s wedding venue. And I don’t believe the people apologising for offending people with these “hateful” picnics and weddings are sorry. All of this is performative, virtue signalling, woke b*llocks. It doesn’t help mend any fences or improve race relations, it just lines the pockets of race hustlers and massages the egos of celebrities who like to imagine they are far more important than they are.

"4 Aug, 2020",Society’s obsession with the ‘n-word’ ignores the real issues plaguing black communities & encourages racial division,"Multiple public figures have landed in hot water in the last week for using the ‘n-word’ in the context of condemning its use. Such an absurd catch-22 is emblematic of a sick society in which wokeness is used to control behavior. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Perhaps the most notorious racial slur in the English language, the “n-word” is generally considered anathema in US and UK society. This is 2020; we’re supposed to have moved beyond using race and ethnicity as insults. But the pre-Civil Rights era is resurfacing in strange ways: ‘woke’ agitators are pushing for everything fromreinstituting segregationin schools topurging controversial figuresfrom history, all in the name of (supposedly) improving race relations. Instead of making race irrelevant, as civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. hoped to do, they’ve appointed it the most important attribute that can define a person. Accordingly, racial slurs have been elevated from venal to mortal sin, and the n-word has once again become a lightning rod for controversy. Two white BBC presenterswere excoriated on social media last week for using the dreaded word, even though both broadcasts roundly condemned its use and incorporated plenty of warning and context. In one case, it was a historical quote from Abraham Lincoln’s assassin John Wilkes Booth that set off the woke alarm, from a program that aired in 2019 with no issues. Despite being prefaced with a ‘health warning’ and providing some valuable historical context on why Booth might go on to shoot Lincoln, the use of the word was deemed inexcusable, and presenter Lucy Worsley took to Twitter to apologize. But in the other case, the segment concerned a racist attack on a 21-year-old black musician that left him in the hospital with multiple broken bones. The perpetrators rammed him with a car while shouting the racial epithet, which presenter Fiona Lamdin uttered uncensored. The BBC defended her use of the word by pointing out the victim’s family “wanted the full facts made public,” but social media nevertheless seemed more upset by a white reporter quoting the word on air than by the attack itself. This kind of laser focus on appearances (use of the n-word) over reality (a racially motivated attack) is depressingly typical of 21st-century woke racial politics. In this type of magical thinking, cracking down on racial slurs is the equivalent of stopping racism itself. If a company like Johnson & Johnson, whichcontinues to hawkasbestos-laden talcum powder outside North America, can be hailed as racially progressive for releasing a line of Band-Aids corresponding to darker skin tones, or PepsiCo can get off the hook for flooding black communities with obesogenic high fructose corn syrup by merelychanging the nameof its Aunt Jemima pancake syrup to something less offensive, attempting to fire a football coach for pointing out the n-word is bad seems perfectly reasonable. Football players at Texas Christian University boycotted practice on Monday after their coach, Gary Patterson, ordered player Dylan Jordan to stop using the n-word around his team-mates. It didn’t matter that Patterson was only using the word (in a private aside with Jordan) to denounce it - “that word is unacceptable under all context,” the boycotters roared after Jordan tweeted about their conversation. I only speak the truth........# blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/7YpY6JvjgM Though he never denied using the word himself, Jordan nevertheless led the witch hunt against Patterson,squealing“This behavior is not OK now or ever”and calling for“repercussions to these actions”.  As calls for his firing mounted, Patterson had no choice but toissue a public apology. Such incidents may sound like the plot of a South Park episode, but they’re reality in two countries that once considered themselves bastions of free expression. Unlike other racial slurs, which fell out of favor with the arrival of the Civil Rights movement, the n-word has lingered like a bad smell on the fringes of society and in the mainstream alike. Many blame hip-hop music and culture, in which a variant of the word (“n***a” as opposed to “n***er”) has multiple non-derogatory meanings, for its ubiquity in inner-city black communities. As hip-hop came to dominate the music charts, so too did its argot spread into white and suburban communities, occasionally bumping up against actual racists who may have been surprised to learn it was now OK to say the n-word as long as you pronounced it a little differently. Rappers like Ice Cube, who popularized the word’s ‘reclamation’ in the 1980s, have pushed back against responsibility for glorifying either the word or the violent lifestyle their music portrays, however. In a bitterly sarcasticsongcalled “Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,” Cube argues that his lyrics, harsh as they may be, are merely a reflection of the unpleasant realities Americans live with. “You the ones that we learned it from,” he tells white authorities who seek to ban his music; “I heard n***er back in 1971.” Certainly, black people have the right to decide whether a racial slur demeaning them has any place in modern society. But declaring the word off-limits only for all other groups opens the door to the kind of fetishization that now swirls around the n-word, the use of which can get a person fired based solely on the color of their skin. It also begs a series of increasingly absurd questions: is a person who’s only 1/16th black “allowed” to use the n-word? What if they’re another dark-skinned minority, but not technically black? The arguments over whether white rappers or fans of hip-hop culture are “allowed” to use the word can be downright farcical, and completely gloss over the real issues - generational poverty, separate-but-unequal race-based policing tactics, mass incarceration, the school-to-prison pipeline - that continue to cause immense suffering in black communities, even as corporations pour millions of dollars into the coffers of blacklivesmatter and other race-grifters. Adopting melanin-based double standards only fans the flames of racial animus. It’s become painfully clear that the leaders of the blacklivesmatter organization do not really want a post-racial society where all groups live together in harmony - they want division along every “intersectional” line in existence, and are willing to invent a few to further atomize the working class while collecting fat checks from corporations terrified of running afoul of the new thought police. This aim does not reflect the wishes of the vast majority of black activists, a growing number of whom arespeaking outagainst blacklivesmatter ’s cooptation of their efforts. But those who profit off racism will do anything to ensure it continues. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"4 Aug, 2020","Media lives matter? More assaults on US journalists in 2020 than in previous 3 years combined, says press freedom watchdog","The number of violent incidents directed at journalists has skyrocketed, according to the US Press Freedom Tracker, which said heavy-handed police tactics during blacklivesmatter protests have made 2020 a uniquely dangerous year for reporters. There have been more than 612 press freedom incidents so far this year, according to the group’s July tally. The figure includes more than 87 arrests, 140 physical attacks, 143 injuries from rubber bullets or projectiles, and 76 cases where equipment was damaged. There have also been dozens of cases of journalists being teargassed or hit with pepper spray. Latest reported aggressions against the press as of Thursday, July 30*612+ total press freedom incidents*87+ arrests140 physical attacks (90 by law enforcement)143 rubber bullet / projectiles80 tear gassings42 pepper sprayings76 equipment / newsroom damage44 other / TBD The press freedom watchdog said that the number of assaults against journalists so far in 2020 is“unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history.”The group has documented more incidents so far this year than in the previous three years combined. The organization typically records around 100-150 press freedom violations in the US each year. Journalists have repeatedly found themselves in the crossfire of nationwide blacklivesmatter protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police. According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, the cases of aggression against reporters are spread out across 72 cities and 35 states. Portland, Oregon currently has the highest reported numbers of assaults against the press, as well as the highest number of journalists hit with projectiles. Federal agents deployed to protect the city’s federal courthouse have been accused of using excessive force against protesters and media who have been covering the demonstrations. A judge recently placed a temporary restraining order on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) forces to prevent them from using crowd control measures against members of the press. The federal agents have since been put on ‘standby,’ with state and local law enforcement tasked with ensuring public safety during the protests, which have lasted for more than two months. Although the huge increase in assaults is concerning, some journalists have complained that protesters have been identifying themselves as press, even as they hurl projectiles at police. These alleged tactics have put actual journalists in danger, according to one reporter who has been on the ground in Portland. Blaze TV’s Elijah Schaffer claimed in a recent tweet that activists were using press immunity to“harass & in some cases assault officers.” This fake Antifa press problem is a pandemic This man defies orders, insults officers, and makes sexual references to them And claims he’s press with a $40 handicam mounted on a gas station tripodDue to a court order police can’t do anythingThis puts real press in dangerpic.twitter.com/cVvenAof0S “This is a new tactic ahead of the election to create mayhem.

"3 Aug, 2020",Portland records highest number of monthly murders in ‘OVER 30 YEARS’ as city slashes police budget,"Portland saw the highest number of homicides in July in more than three decades, officials say. The uptick in violence has strained police resources, which have already suffered from budget cuts. The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) is investigating 15 murders that occurred in July, making the month one of the deadliest for the city in recent memory, local newspaper the Oregonian reported. The city has registered 24 homicides so far this year, meaning that last month alone accounted for more than half of the city’s violent deaths in 2020. July also saw 63 shootings, compared to 28 during the same month last year, the PPB said. Police Chief Chuck Lovell expressed concern that the surge in murders was thinning out limited police resources, as officers who would normally patrol the city had been reassigned to help with investigations. The increase in murders coincided with the city council’s decision to shave more than $15 million from the PPB’s budget. The budget cuts, which took effect on July 1, led to the disbanding of police units that work in schools, investigate gun violence, and patrol the city’s public transport system. Lovell suggested that the loss of the city’s 34-member Gun Violence Reduction Team was particularly regrettable. The budget cuts were part of an ongoing nationwide movement to“defund”the police, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police. Portland is still reeling from demonstrations that have been held every night for more than two months. The protests became increasingly violent in July after federal agents were deployed to protect the city’s federal courthouse. A deal between the state of Oregon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has called for the federal forces to be replaced by state and local law enforcement, which will likely place further strain on the city’s police.

"3 Aug, 2020", Karma : NBA star who refused to kneel for blacklivesmatter is cruelly TAUNTED as he exits in wheelchair with knee injury (VIDEO),"Fans and analysts have turned on Orlando Magic star Jonathan Isaac and each other after he shunned the blacklivesmatter T-shirts worn by his teammates, stood during the anthem and left in a wheelchair with a painful knee injury. Forward and ordained minister Isaac was the first NBA star not to kneel during the national anthem as part of the blacklivesmatter movement, standing in his team colors while his teammates observed the gesture in T-shirts bearing the name of the campaign. He explained that""black lives are supported through the gospel""before enduring an agonizing end to Magic s win over Sacramento Kings on Sunday, collapsing to the floor and leaving the court in a wheelchair with what proved to be a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The 22-year-old was playing just his second game since returning from hyperextending the same knee on New Year s Day, missing 31 games with a posterior lateral corner injury and medial bone contusion. Prayers up for Jonathan Isaac after being taken off in a wheelchair with a knee injury. 🙏pic.twitter.com/tWoMEcDjKr This is super ironic.

""Refused to kneel so 2020 had to take the knee away,""another crueller response said, while one argued:""Isaac won t get a lot of empathy here as he didn t exhibit any [earlier]. ""I m sure people will try to chastise folks for not caring about him but who gives a f*ck about an injury? Why should I care about an athlete s career when he doesn t give a f*ck about people s lives?"" Before making his stand for the first time ahead of Magic s win at Brooklyn Nets on Friday, Isaac insisted:""I do believe that blacklivesmatter . ""I just felt like it was a decision I had to make and I didn t feel like putting that shirt on and kneeling went hand in hand with supporting Black lives. Wait Jonathan Isaac decided not to kneel then got a knee injury?pic.twitter.com/JWyvQnyzkx Seeking woke NBA cheer Jonathan Isaac getting hurt is so metaphoric the disgustingness and idiocracy of these people If you’re celebrating Jonathan Isaac’s injury there’s something wrong with you There is something seriously wrong with the people making fun of Jonathan Isaac’s injruyPrayers up for Issac. ""I don t think that kneeling or putting on a t-shirt for me, personally, is the answer."" Kings reporter Kayte Christensen-Hunter voiced her fury at fans who taunted Isaac in the aftermath of his horrendous-looking injury. ""I got a lot of tweets from people saying that this was karma,""she revealed.""That s just really nasty. ""That is not what sport is about. I implore you all to have some decency. That is disgusting to me."" The taking of the knee during the national anthem has been a point of contention ever since NFL star Colin Kaepernick started the trend in 2016, earning praise from many social justice campaigners alongside rebukes from figures including US president Donald Trump, who has threatened to boycott teams should they opt to kneel.

""This is what courage looks like,""he declared.""When the rest of the NBA took a knee, Isaac stood with pride for America. Sometimes, when you stand for what is right, you must stand alone.

STATEMENT FROM MAYOR TED WHEELER: I m pleased the Governor and the Multnomah County Sheriff responded favorably to my request for mutual aid to implement the great planning work Portland Police have done to be ready for this weekend s potential protests. The additional resources provided by the state police will go a long way to ensuring we are able to do everything possible to be ready when alt-right and white nationalist groups come to our city.We all agree our state and our nation are facing unprecedented threats. I want our entire community to know - first and foremost - our shared priority is to ensure and protect the safety and well-being of everyone in the face of rampant divisiveness and ongoing violence. Having a unified command structure uniting the resources of the state, the county and the city is a timely and appropriate response to the threat we face.I categorically condemn violence of all kinds by all people. But let me be clear, the alt-right and white supremacist groups organizing to come to Portland on Saturday present the greatest threat we ve faced so far.These groups embody and empower racism, intolerance and hate. Those are not Portland values, and they are not welcome here. Hate has no home in Portland. They have actively threatened violence against elected officials and others in our community.For Saturday to remain peaceful, we need everyone s help - the state, the county and the community. We must stand together, and we are. Together, we can prevent white nationalists from achieving their goals of spreading fear and intimidation and of misrepresenting Portland for political gain.We will always support the rights of people to peacefully assemble. And we will always stand against those who provoke violence, regardless of their beliefs.Again, I want to thank the Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff for their support. Because of their leadership, combined with that of Portland Police Chief Lovell, I m hopeful everyone will stay safe this weekend. I also want to thank the City of Milwaukie and the City of Lake Oswego, who also responded to our request for additional officers and support.Finally, I know there s a lot of interest in the use of tear gas. My order banning the Portland Police from using tear gas for crowd control remains in place.This weekend don t give out of town racists and bullies the satisfaction of distracting us, or slowing us down. Let s keep our focus on what s important and keep pressing forward together. And once again, thanks to our partners for responding to our request for mutual aid under these extraordinary circumstances.

"2 Aug, 2020",‘Do as they say’: Minneapolis police warn people to obey criminals for their own safety as violent crime surges amid blacklivesmatter protests,"Embattled Minneapolis police are advising residents on survival skills amid a wave of violent crime, offering such tips as “be prepared to give up your cell phone and purse/wallet” to robbers and “do not walk alone.” “Do not argue or fight with the criminal,”police said in a July 28letterto Third Precinct residents.“Do what they say. Your safety is most important.” The Third Precinct, southeast of downtown, was one of the areas hardest hit by the protests-turned-riots that broke out following the May 25 killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Ensuing demonstrations and riots in the adjoining cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul marked the second-most destructive incident of civil unrest in US history. Police wereforced to abandontheir Third Precinct headquarters for their own safety on May 28 as rioters pulled down a fence and set the building on fire. Minneapolis City Government tells residents to be ready to give up their phones and wallets and to always cooperate with criminals:pic.twitter.com/qQhw4YLRSY Carjackings and other robberies have skyrocketed in the wake of the blacklivesmatter protests. Police said there were 20 carjackings and 100 other robberies reported in July in the Third Precinct alone.“Some victims have been maced, dragged, assaulted and some threatened with a gun,”police said in the warning to locals. In an era of rising crime and a push by many on the left to defund police and“reimagine”law enforcement in Democrat-controlled cities, the self-help tips in Minneapolis may be a sign of things to come. The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously in June to replace the city s police department with a“department of community safety and violence prevention, which will have responsibility for public safety services prioritizing a holistic, public health-oriented approach.” The plan will need approval from voters in November, meaning it will primarily affect police resources after 2020, but the city last month took $1.1 million out of this year s police budget to fund a Health Department program in which staff are sent out to“mediate”violent conflicts. Some Minneapolis residents are already adjusting to deteriorating public safety by setting up armed patrols in their neighborhoods. Minneapolis police are operating under a court order that bans such tactics as choke holds and requires that any use of rubber bullets or other crowd-control measures be approved by the police chief. More than 150 officers filed disability claims for post-traumatic stress disorder and other injuries suffered during the protests. In Seattle, where officers were banned altogether from using crowd-control weapons, Police Chief Carmen Best warned business owners last month that her department would have“no ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.” Seattle City Council members introduced aresolutionFriday to create a new community safety department that would replace much of the police force. Police also have been restrained by city leaders in Portland, which had 15 reported homicides in July, the highest monthly total in more than three decades. There were 63 shootings reported through the first 29 days of July, police data showed, up from 28 in all of July 2019. Newsmax journalist John Cardillo, a former New York City policeman, saidin a tweetthat the Minneapolis letter essentially tells residents to“prepare to be robbed, obey criminals and hand over their belongings. This is where we are now.” Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers won their first game in the 2020 NBA bubble as the league kicked off its extended season on Thursday night, and the craziest thing that he did was worry if controversial out-of-work and overpaid former athlete Colin Kaepernick was happy with theproduct. Yes, Kaepernick is such a great role model, right? It s hard to believe there are so many uneducated idiots in major league sports. If people would stop going to games, stop buying the merchandise, stop buying major league products for their kids, and stop turning on the games, this nonsense would stop. NBA players were able to remove their names from their jerseys and add social justice messages for the first time in the history of the league. The NBA court also bore the message“ blacklivesmatter .” It s a sad, sad day when you want to make a shakedown millionaire happy under the disguise of promoting social justice during this season. But then again, it has now become the norm to kneel, instead of choosing the braver route of taking a stand and actually standing up. The irony here is how the NBA stars are taking billions from China, and sitting on their hands while China runs child sweatshops or pays slave wages, takes democracy away from Hong Kong, and arrests dissenters for speaking out – something they just did in this country because it is their right. I am not going too far in calling these part-time activists a bunch of hypocritical idiots. ESPN ran an explosive story earlier this week, about human rights abuses that allegedly took place at the NBA s training academies in China. This bombshell report alleged that the young participants in the NBA program were physically beaten by Chinese instructors and were not provided proper schooling, despite commissioner Adam Silver s previous commitment that education would be “central” to the program. A former league employee compared the atmosphere when he worked in Xinjiang to Germany in World War II. Hey, LeBron… you with the estimated networthof $450m... do you want to comment on this? Here s an excellent idea: instead of kneeling, why don t these superstars put their money where their mouth is and fund the change they seek? Starting with the culture and lack of parenting that holds much of the black community hostage? Change begins at home. They can use their platform to inspire black people to rise and overcome, not encourage hate and disrespect for our flag and our country. Anyone who hates the US so much just needs to leave. As for the blacklivesmatter organization, they don t care about black lives one bit. If they did, they would address the crime and violence inside of our neighborhoods and work to bring that down on a national scale. They would be just as upset about a black child’s life taken in a drive-by at the hands of criminals and gang members who live for nothing but themselves. Where are the protests by these NBA players denouncing such black violence? Where are the neighborhood protests for the thousands of blacks murdered annually by their own kind? Where are the protests for the hundreds of innocent children that are killed by their kind? The Marxist blacklivesmatter organization is a group of opportunists who are making a killing in donations and monies from large corporations who feel the need to show their participation in keeping the lie alive. James does not speak for anyone but other rich sports players who have made their millions off the backs of Americans who work and contribute to society. You know... police officers, military families, health care workers, trash haulers, teachers, etc. Sport is about entertainment and escape. I don t need to be lectured, especially by a bunch of rich “do I say and not as I do” sorts that only practice activism during their work schedules, not during their family vacation. Many Americans feel that ending racism must always be a goal in our land; never take your eyes off of it! But our flag is our symbol of all that is GOOD about America – NOT what her problems are! The patriot, hand over heart, stands for the anthem in respect for the founding values of the USA (slavery was an accommodated act, not a founding value). To disrespect the flag is to disrespect the goodness and the true hope of America. That hope includes a land free from racism. Every time I stand for the anthem, I stand AGAINST racism and those that promoted and practiced it long before I was born and afterwards. Nothing, therefore, excuses kneeling during the national anthem. Again, it insults the hopes of America, and that denigrates us all. As a military veteran, I believe the true patriot understands the battle against racism is to be fought elsewhere - not when we stand for our nation s anthem. When we are united and thankful for the land of the free and the home of the brave: the greatest nation on Earth! Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"22 Jul, 2020",‘Example of white supremacy’: Activists blame ‘MAGA 2020’ mural request for destruction of blacklivesmatter mural in California,"An online petition states that the removal of a blacklivesmatter mural in a California city is “white supremacy” in action. They say officials destroyed it after a local woman applied for a permit to paint a pro-Trump message. The 17-foot (5m) mural in downtown Redwood City was scrubbed in order to avoid“driver confusion and traffic accidents,”city spokesperson Jennifer Yamaguma told local media, adding that the authorities will no longer permit“art”installations to appear on the streets. The mural was painted earlier this month by a local resident named Dan Pease. Local media reported that the city had not only authorized Pease’s project but supplied him with yellow poster board paint. The man told KPIX-TV that he expected the mural to last“as long as the paint lasted.” Want to get rid of the blacklivesmatter graffiti on the city streets? Apparently this is the best/fastest way to do it.https://t.co/OrCaybpQL7 City officials appear to have suddenly changed their attitude after another person, Maria Rutenburg, applied for a permit to paint a ‘MAGA 2020’ mural.“I saw ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ sign appearing on Broadway Street on the asphalt and I figured that’s gonna be a new public space, open for discussion, and I wanted to get my message out, too,”she told local media. Rutenburg’s request was ultimately denied, and the city did not link her application to the swift removal of the blacklivesmatter mural. However, many on social media are now blaming the woman and her idea for a pro-Trump mural for the removal. A petition was launched online, which alleges that the city destroyed the sign because of“a single complaint by a white woman.”The petition went on to state that“such negation of the community’s voice is itself an example of white supremacy – privileging one white voice over the community’s.” Numerous blacklivesmatter murals were painted on the streets of US cities in the wake of massive protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May.

"20 Jul, 2020","Grab a shovel, America! This election season the fake news, hoaxes and tell-all books are flowing fast down the pipe","Amid an epic political battle for the White House, Americans can no longer believe what they read and hear in the media. This is a dangerous reality for the nation, which needs accurate information to meet a flurry of challenges. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Every four years, the US mainstream media should be required to carry a surgeon general’s warning on its TV and print publications that states: ‘Consuming mainstream media in an election year may critically impair a voter’s ability to make rational decisions due to skewed information. Use at your own discretion.’ Anyone who doubts that statement may wish to consider the impressivehatchetjob that CNN’s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta performed last week when quoting White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. In an effort to explain that the Trump administration was in favor of opening schools amid the Covid crisis, McEnany told a press conference:“The science should not stand in the way of this… the science is very clear on this... We encourage... localities and states to just simply follow the science. Open our schools.” Despite the straightforwardness of the message, Acosta tweeted out to his 1.7 million followers just 10 words from McEnany’s monologue, the part where she said:“The science should not stand in the way of this.”That deliberate distortion prompted thousands of misinformed people to accuse the Trump administration of practically being neo-luddites and ‘anti-science.’ Was Acosta’s shoddy reporting just an oversight, or could it be chalked up as a politically motivated hit job against the Republicans with presidential elections just over 100 days away? Considering the mainstream media’s well-known history of negative reporting on Donald Trump, it is very tempting to go with the latter explanation. pretty dishonest journalism here. CNN’s acosta cuts off the quote, doesn’t give full context, and goes viral.

Thus far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Amid fears that the number of Covid cases is being padded, possibly due to the political incentive, it was revealed that a 20-year-old Florida man who died in a motorcycle crash was listed as a Covid-related death. How many other deathsarebeing wrongly dropped into the Covidcategoryis anyone’s guess, but many high-ranking officialsbelievethere are serious problems with the tallying of numbers. It’s this sort of willingness to jump to unreasonable conclusions over a highly sensitive issue that may have led NASCAR race driver Bubba Wallace to confuse a garage door opener for an actual noose, thereby inflaming racial tensions at the worst possible time. Was there any sort of political motivation behind the claim, which has been debunked by an FBIinvestigation, that a ‘hate crime’ had been committed? That is hard to say, but it cannot be ignored that the incident – coming at the very same time America’s streets were being overrun by blacklivesmatter protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death – sparked a war of words on Twitter between the African-American NASCAR driver and Donald Trump. Has@BubbaWallaceapologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER! Meanwhile, amid the ongoing hysteria over Covid and race relations, Russiagate may seem like ancient history, yet that didn’t prevent it from floating to the surface again last week. It happened as Attorney General William Barrdeclassifiedtwo documents that proved beyond reasonable doubt the FBI was aware of some dozen inaccuracies in a 2017 New York Timesreport, the most devastating being that Trump officials were having contacts with Russian intelligence officers. The discovery presented a nice opportunity for America’s purported ‘paper of historical record’ to set the record straight with regards to the political witch hunt, prompted by unfounded accusations in the so-called ‘Steele Dossier,’ which hounded the Trump administration for four long years. Yet the New York Times has chosen to cling to its story, refusing to provide either an apology or a retraction to its readers. “We stand by our reporting,”saidEileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman. And then there were, of course, the books – tell-all screeds from confidants and even family members close to Donald Trump – with their tantalizing tidbits of information that the media promised would sink the US president’s political career once and for all. Former US national security adviser John Bolton, for example, who Trump dismissed in September 2019, released ‘The Room Where It Happened’ in June. As regularly occurs in Washington DC, which has arguably the worst plumbing in the world, a copy of the manuscript wasleakedonline in January, at the very same time – surprise, surprise – Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry. Despite the heated anticipation over the prospect that the book’s revelations would help drive Trump from office, the fanfare trickled out when even Bolton himselfadmittedhe had no ‘silver bullet,’ as it were, to help the Democrats’ cause. Another election-year blast, entitled ‘Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World s Most Dangerous Man,’ was released by none other than Trump’s niece. Where Bolton hoped to demolish his former boss with a cheap he-said, she-said expose from inside of the White House, Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, hoped to accomplish the same by detailing aspects of Trump’s family life. At one point in the book, Mary Trump revealed how her father’s family had been left out of her grandfather’s will, with the bulk of the family fortune passing to the favored Donald. After that revelation, she writes:“Donald, following the lead of my grandfather and with the complicity, silence and inaction of his siblings, destroyed my father. I can’t let him destroy my country.” Could Mary Trump’s book be dismissed as a case of sour grapes, or even ‘fake news’ by a disgruntled Trump family member? It seems entirely possible. That is precisely the problem with such tell-all memoirs; the veracity of the claims is difficult to prove since they rely on the hazy recollections – not to mention the personal prejudices – of the storyteller. In any case, both books, which have gone on to sell millions of copies, provide fodder against the US president in the most hotly contested US presidential election in many years. This leads us to the question: what can the American voter truly believe this election year? The answer seems to be ‘absolutely nothing.’ From fudged reports emerging from White House press briefings, to the muddled memories of former Trump confidantes and relatives, it seems that everything is tainted in some way by political intrigue. As happens every four years, truth has fled the American house. The difference this time around, however, is that an ominous cloud of violence, unrest and upheaval hangs over these elections like never before. Therefore, with every fake news story that gets circulated, the chances that the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election will turn ugly only increases. After all, people are not stupid, and they are very good at understanding when they are being fooled. Yet the only thing Americans can put their faith in these days is that the uncertainty will only continue, straight up to November 3. What the morning of November 4 will look like in America is anybody’s guess, but I doubt fake news will be able to conceal it. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"19 Jul, 2020",Trump says he’d get ‘50 YEARS FOR TREASON’ for what Obama & Biden did as he launches full-on attack on his rival,"US President Donald Trump has unleashed a fresh offensive on Joe Biden, suggesting his presidential rival should be punished for “spying” and “treason,” and needs to be subjected to a cognitive ability exam. Trump went on the warpath on Sunday, with Joe Biden the target of his rage. In a scathing tweet, he accused Biden of being“totally controlled”by the“radical left,”referring to the leaders of Portland, where blacklivesmatter and Antifa rioters have battered and burned the city’s Justice Center for more than 50 days. The Radical Left Democrats, who totally control Biden, will destroy our Country as we know it. Unimaginably bad things would happen to America. Look at Portland, where the pols are just fine with 50 days of anarchy. We sent in help. Look at New York, Chicago, Philadelphia. NO! Trump then resurrected a long-standing gripe with the Barack Obama administration, which was in power when the FBI launched a surveillance operation on his presidential campaign in 2016. Recently declassifieddocumentsrevealed that this operation involved a number of White House officials, among them then-Vice President Joe Biden. “So we catch Obama & Biden, not to even mention the rest of their crew, SPYING on my campaign, AND NOTHING HAPPENS?”Trump tweeted.“I hope not! If it were the other way around, 50 years for treason. NEVER FORGET!!!!” So we catch Obama & Biden, not to even mention the rest of their crew, SPYING on my campaign, AND NOTHING HAPPENS? I hope not! If it were the other way around, 50 years for treason. NEVER FORGET!!!! Trump doesn’t seem likely to forget, as he’s often accused the Obama administration of“treasonous crimes”against his campaign.“Treason”is a word he’s thrown at the Democrats for a range of other deeds as well. The impeachment inquiry against him, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ‘Russiagate’ investigation, and the Democrats’ effort to block his long-promised border wall have all been described by Trump as“treason”or“treasonous.” However, with November’s election less than four months away, it’s unsurprising that Biden would occupy prime real estate in the president’s mind. Nationalpolls, which Trump has dismissed as“suppression,”currently put Biden ahead of Trump by double figures, as the president reels from the coronavirus pandemic and the recent blacklivesmatter protests and riots. With the election closing in, Trump has also focused on one of Biden’s obvious weaknesses: his apparent mental decline. Biden oftenstrugglesto finish sentences, forgets where he is, andconfusesimportant figures. Trump just challenged Biden to take a live cognitive test with himpic.twitter.com/RZfH0PuiYw In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump asked Biden to take a live cognitive ability test alongside him – the same test Trump took in 2018, which his doctor said he“aced.” “I guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions,”Trump jibed. Before Sunday s interview, the president said that Biden“doesn’t know where he is, or what he’s doing.” Like this story?

"18 Jul, 2020",Leader of radical black-only militia NFAC ‘believes in violence’ & wants a real-life Wakanda for every black person in America,"NFAC, the masked, armed black militia that recently marched through a park in Georgia, deems violence and killing an acceptable response to oppression. Their end goal is to break away from the US as their own black-only nation. ByChris Sweeney, author who has written for various UK magazines and newspapers, including The Times, The Sun and The Daily Record. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney The NFAC (Not F*cking Around Coalition) grabbed plenty of attention on social media with a high-profile public debut on July 4. The sight of an all-black militia, clutching rifles and handguns, marching in the heartland of the Ku Klux Klan at Stone Mountain caused plenty of ripples. But very little is known about them, despite a frenzy of speculation. It’s not even clear when they were created or how many of them there are. So to make their intentions clear, NFAC founder and leader Grand Master Jay (real name John Fitzgerald Johnson) spoke exclusively to RT. There’s a misconception that we’re a terrorist group and want to kill white people. “We are here to protect the black community, as that’s who is under attack. Nobody is protecting black children, men and women in America. What necessitated the creation of NFAC was the need to address a rising tide of police brutality, of racial brutality, of unfairness in the judicial system,”he said. “Most of us like me are ex-miliitary, we’re not young people on the block, we’re voters, we’re your responsible guys, we’re the guys with the good jobs.” While seeing themselves as protectors, Jay has a clear aim of what he wants to achieve – and he’s not playing it small. He feels that black people need to be split from the rest of the US. So he says he, and others, are filing an order of liberation with the International Court of Justice. He explained:“I want them to declare every black person who is a descendent of the Portuguese slave trade a political prisoner of the United States. And to sanction the United States to do one of two things. The first is give us our own land here, so we can go in, set up our own government and the whole nine yards.” Some have speculated that Jay is demanding the states of Texas as this land, but he only used the Lone Star state as an example. The key is to be given land no longer controlled by the White House. The other option is more radical, which most media have refused to publish. Jay revealed:“It s a glaring fact that mainstream media in the United States has completely ignored the NFAC. ABC News tried to do an interview with me but found the information too scary, so they buried the story as a history piece about Stone Mountain.” The mainstream media will not report on us, as images of organized black folks with guns would send shivers down the spine of the racist core of America. “My other aim is for an exodus to Africa, to establish our destiny and build our own nation –  and get a seat at the UN like everybody else. Forty-five million of us is a nation within a nation, so we can take ourselves to a place where two countries friendly to us are willing to carve out some land. That would be in Africa, as it s where we come from, where we have greater numbers, where resources are and I already have relationships with some of the rulers of those countries. Hypothetically, I want to get an area of about  100 miles on each side, declare it a sovereign zone and build an infrastructure.” The exodus would only include black people. The NFAC only allow black members, and Jay doesn’t feel this should be a shocking admission. “Every other entity has their own, we’re the only people on the planet who don’t,”he said. “If something happens to a Chinese person in America, China gets upset. If it’s British person, the Queen has something to say about it. The color black is not a country, so if something happens to a black person in America, nobody gets upset.” The riots that broke out after the latest resonant police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, is apparently not what he has in mind. He wants to take things global. “We have no identity, they call us African Americans but tell me, where in Africa? There are 55 countries in Africa.” If we have our own country, then if something happens in America, we can go to the UN and say ‘that’s a violation.’ Those with a single black parent could be included but would be investigated by the NFAC along with their“pattern of behaviour.” NFAC hasn’t been spawned by the blacklivesmatter movement. Jay was part of blacklivesmatter several years ago but grew frustrated by their direction. He feels a more authoritarian approach is the only way forward. “ blacklivesmatter does not represent the sentiments of the black community.We have distanced ourselves from them completely,”Jay admitted. “ blacklivesmatter doesn’t believe in violence, we do. We chose America’s Independence Day to send that message as we were slaves when that happened, we were not members of this country. We tried to be here for 247 years, we had reconstruction and they burned our towns down, we had Jim Crow when they set dogs on us and told us we couldn’t sit next to them –  we tried that with affirmative action and they rolled that back. It s obvious they don’t want us here.” NFAC s willingness to kill could be why they are shunned by the more mainstream activists. But Jay feels justified as he claims there have been 457 controversial killings since the 2014 police shooting of 18-year-old black man Michael Brown. “If anybody in our group has a personal agenda and just wants to shoot some people, then we’re not the group for them,”he says, before calmly explaining the rules of engagement: But on July 4 before we went to the park my orders were, kill them – not shoot or wound them, kill them. “That was the safety briefing. I told them we were not to initiate anything but if they attack us, then everyone out here will kill everyone in sight. We don t want to hear your excuses anymore, we don’t want to hear let’s talk or wait for the grand jury.” Along with the Stone Mountain march, the NFAC held a simultaneous event in Phoenix’s Escobar Park. Since then, Jay claims he’s been flooded by contacts globally and now has NFAC chapters internationally. However, members’ identities will remain anonymous. “There s a vetting process, we inspect them and then they get sworn into the NFAC,”he said. “We are also a coalition so some existing organizations want to be a part of us too, so we vet their members too. ""We learned our lessons from types of infiltration methodologies.That’s why we’re so secretive about our numbers, that’s why you cannot find out where we train, that’s why we are not as open to giving up the details.” The only name or face that is known is mine. I speak, no one else does. Back in 2016, Jayran for presidentbut felt his campaign was purposely sidelined. He regards 2020 contender Kanye as“a political joke”but did reveal some have urged him to run again. “Since Kanye’s announcement, I’ve received phone calls saying ‘you do know if you run for the presidency right now, you would win hands down,’”Jay said. “But my mission is not to save America, I tried that and I found out that big money and the media can be bought to block out good candidates. I will not go down that road again. “My goal is much loftier than that, not only to facilitate the exodus of the black nation here in America but the implementation of what we would call the United State of Africa.” Since July 4, Jay feels the NFAC had already made a clear difference. Things in his view have calmed down.“They got the message, there hasn’t been one lynching or police involved shooting since and a wave of unity has swept the black community and we’re seeing the judicial system trying to prosecute the cases.” While the NFAC is only for blacks, he does encourage other races to support their cause. Malcolm X said it best, you can help us, but you can’t join us. “Unless we are by ourselves and until we learn to love ourselves, we can’t love another people. When a people are denied knowledge of their culture and history of self, they have nothing to be proud of. “Did you see how proud they felt when they saw the movie ‘Black Panther’ which is make believe? Black people are yearning to belong to something, we have got to give them something to belong to. I would rather give my life for something noble like the liberation of my people, rather than to waste it staying alive being a weakling.” “And what you’ll find is, I’m not alone.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"17 Jul, 2020",A curriculum of indoctrination: How left-wing teaching unions are holding parents & children to ransom,"The refusal of radical union leaders to reopen schools this fall unless their demands are met is not about Covid-19 – it’s a political act aimed at getting Joe Biden elected in November. Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi America s teachers’ unions are composed of racialized political activists who indoctrinate rather than educate our children. For the past 40 years, teachers have been radicalizing and imposing their extreme left values, sold as“progressive ideologies,”on our children. Mirroring the Marxist blacklivesmatter model, the teachers’ unions and blacklivesmatter both demand the destruction of all heroes, symbols and statues to facilitate their total rewrite of history. The“plan”includes imposing hyper-sexualized norms on our children with complete disregard and disdain for their parents’ normative values. The teachers’ unions demand our children be led down the road to Marxism, which will help ensure the destruction of the nuclear family unit along with traditional family values. It is clear that US teacher unions possess a frightening amount of power and need to be broken up, just like Jimmy Hoffa’s Teamsters Union in the 1950s and ‘60s. In the LA school district, the California Teachers Union (CTU) has decided to keep schools closed this fall. The CTU is also making extortionate political demands, such as defunding the police, an end to charter schools (which are autonomous, often-parent led, and largely non-unionized) and money in the form of gigantic federal subsidies, ahead of the needs and rights of students. The CTU uses any opportunity, especially the global coronavirus pandemic, to slam Trump and influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. During an interview on John Catsimatidis s radio show, Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Union, a member of the AFL-CIO and a staunch democraticparty activist,threatenedparents that“there s no way”schools will reopen in the fall unless her union’s demands are met. Weingarten – a regular donor to the democraticparty – is also demanding massive federal funding before reopening schools in the fall, all while fashionably attackingPresident Donald Trump. Not to be left behind, the propaganda rag known as the New York Times recently had their most talented fearmongering race-baiters and propagandists launch into another anti-Trumpscreedtitled ‘Trump Threatens To Turn Pandemic Schooling Into A Culture War’. When in doubt, blame Trump. One must ask if this is about what is best for our children, or is this about evil political operatives who have an agenda to see Biden elected president of the USA? The debate to reopen schools in the US has become more about politics than about actual science. The left ignores the fact that while the number of new infections has increased, the 7-day average number of Covid deaths has dropped from 2,232 in mid-April to 724 deaths as of July 14, 2020 – a near 70 percent decrease, which is terrific news. The left also ignores the fact that there has been no discernible spread of Covid-19 by children below 12 and no mortalities of children below 15 at all. In fact, while America is still arguing about reopening its schools, most children in Asia and Europe are already back in school. These countries have focused on hygiene, hand washing, social distancing and testing. Recently, many countries in Asia and Europe have even gone as far as to drop social distancing limits. In France, experts have found no correlation showing that children transmit Covid-19 to adults. This week, a German study reported schools have a low coronavirus infection rate. The results showed that“the dynamics of the virus spreading have been overestimated”and that schools did not develop a high transmission rate after reopening in May. In the German study of 2,045 blood samples taken from 13 school districts, Professor Reinhard Berner, the clinic director of the Clinic and Polyclinic for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine of the Dresden University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus,concludes: “This means that a silent, symptom-free infection in the pupils and teachers examined by us has so far occurred less frequently than we suspected. These results of the investigation provide evidence that virus transmission in families is not as dynamic as previously thought. More than 20 of the subjects examined had at least one proven corona case in the family; however, antibodies were found in only one of these study participants, which would mean that the majority of schoolchildren did not experience any infection themselves despite an infection in the household. This finding must also be taken into account when it comes to deciding on measures to limit contact."" Not allowing schools to reopen hurts children. It is likely to cause educational and socialization problems and to deprive the most vulnerable, low-income and special-needs children of nutritious meals and a place to escape their dysfunctional and often abusive households. In response to the teachers’ unions push to“defund the police”a week ago, Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, pulled 600 specialist anti-crime police officers off the city’s streets. Has the plan worked? No. A one-year-old boy was murdered in NYC. The plan is an epic failure that has and will cost the lives of our children. In the last week, at least 21 children were murdered in America. Our biggest cities are no longer safe. Enough is enough – people need to fight this madness. Stop the push to demonize and defund our police. Our law enforcement officers need to be supported, not dehumanized. Yes, there are bad cops, but there are also bad doctors, bad teachers, bad bankers and bad people in every profession. Just as a perfect socialist Utopian green new deal doesn t exist, perfect humans don t exist either. Civil society demands unity, not anarchy that features shrieking minorities who use fascist tactics to impose Marxist values on the majority. While I disagree with the massive boycotts the majority are planning against major“woke corporations”for their phony virtue signaling, identity politics and discriminatory practices, the time for people to speak out is now. It s time for a national review of public school curriculums. It’s time to break these powerful unions. It’s time to increase funding of charter schools that allow parents to decide what is being taught to their children. Cancel culture needs to end now if we are to restore democracy, liberty and the American dream for everyone because black lives and, in fact, all lives matter more than political agendas and the left’s repugnant agenda-driven opportunism.

"15 Jul, 2020",NYPD’s top uniformed officer & 2 other cops attacked by blacklivesmatter counter-protest group crossing Brooklyn Bridge (VIDEO),"A small group of counter-protesters assaulted three New York Police Department officers, including the most senior uniformed cop with almost 40 years on the force, during a protest in support of the NYPD on the Brooklyn Bridge. NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan was hospitalized with a broken finger and required stitches after a group of demonstrators attacked him and two other officers on the bridge during a ‘Stop the Violence’ protest on Wednesday. Two other cops – a lieutenant and a sergeant, according to local media – were left bleeding from minor head wounds, according to photos released by the NYPD. These are the injuries our officers sustained.pic.twitter.com/KI9wQKywHH At least 37 people were arrested during the demonstration, which was backed by NYPD union the Sergeants Benevolent Association. Video of the altercation shows a counter-protester running along the upper level of an on-ramp to the bridge and hitting the cops with a big stick as they struggled with two other protesters through a fence. It’s not clear how the skirmish began. Pro-cop protesters, including elected officials, police unions, church groups, and community leaders, marched across the bridge only to come face to face with counter-demonstrators from the Occupy City Hall protest, many of whom have been camped out in a park near City Hall (and the on-ramp to the bridge) demanding Mayor Bill de Blasio defund the NYPD to the tune of $1 billion. The city’s budget was submitted weeks ago, yet some occupiers remain in the park. Monahan, a 38-year officer from the Bronx, was actually filmed hugging protesters and ‘taking a knee’ during a protest last month in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park. However, he also spoke out against a City Council bill introduced earlier this month banning the use of diaphragm-pressing restraint holds – typically involving pressing a knee into a suspect’s back – claiming criminalizing the tactic would be “dangerous.” New York has seen a spike in crime led by a major uptick in shootings – June of 2020 was the most violent month since 1996 – exacerbated by bail reform, the coronavirus pandemic, and the devastating economic shutdowns that have plunged millions of Americans into poverty. At the same time, the police killing of black security guard George Floyd in Minneapolis in May has triggered months of sometimes-violent protests across the nation, accompanied by a steep rise in anti-cop sentiment. Monahan lamented earlier this month that “it’s tough to be a police officer now.” Pro- and anti-police demonstrators also clashed in Brooklyn over the weekend, occasionally coming to blows, and a New York Post reporter was allegedly struck in the face by a protester at Manhattan’s City Hall on Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio has drawn the ire of both sides as he refuses to make a firm commitment to backing either the police, the protesters, or the city business owners and residents caught between both – outside of cosmetic gestures like painting “ blacklivesmatter ” outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, of course.

"14 Jul, 2020",Introducing Kanye Derangement Syndrome: Chance the Rapper asks why Joe Biden would be better than Yeezy… and the left goes crazy,"Chance the Rapper triggered liberals by asking: Why would Biden make a better president than Kanye West? It’s a legitimate question, but the vitriolic response suggests honest debate has fallen victim to cancel culture, too. is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture. He has previously written for outlets such as Breitbart, LifeZette, and BizPac Review among others. Follow him on Twitter@WritingLeeman Since Kanye West announced hisintentionto run for president, numerous theories have been thrown out by talking heads in an effort to make sense of just one more crazy headline in the insanity that is 2020. Is he running tosplitthe vote and help President Donald Trump against Biden, the presumptive presidential nominee for the democraticparty ? Or is he simplytrollingand building his brand? Nobody really knows, but considering the fact that West has gone from a MAGA-hat wearing Trump supporter to wanting his own political party called the Birthday Party, there is little chance we will be seeing a serious three-way race between the rapper, the president, and Biden. Even if he is trolling, it’s an impressive troll. He’s already earnedendorsementsfrom billionaire Elon Musk, and now Chicago musician Chance the Rapper, real name Chancelor Johnathan Bennett, is the latest to warm to the idea of President Yeezy. After West tweeted out a new song and video in honor of his late mother on Monday, Bennett jumped in to show his support.“And y’all out here tryna convince me to vote for Biden,”he tweeted with the video. And yall out here tryna convince me to vote for Biden. Smfhhttps://t.co/JgbGBmPQk5 Bennett continued tweeting about the matter by posing some simple questions to his 8.3 million followers. “Are u more pro biden or anti ye and why? I get that you’ll want to reply that you’re just tryna ‘get trump out’ but in this hypothetical scenario where you’re replacing Trump, can someone explain why Joe Biden would be better??”he asked in one tweet. Are u more pro biden or anti ye and why? I get that you’ll want to reply that you’re just tryna “get trump out” but in this hypothetical scenario where you’re replacing Trump, can someone explain why Joe Biden would be better?? Asking supporters to explain why a man who has been accused ofsexual assault, was part of a controversial administration, and is a walking, talkinggaffe-machinewho continuously confuses where he is would seem like a logical inquiry. But logic does not apply when you are talking about Trump — nor does it appear to when discussing Kanye either. Instead of starting an open dialogue, Chance was barraged with messages typical of Resistance Twitter, accusing him of supporting a racist by not voting Biden, and being labeled a“lunatic”for even posing the question. I’ll say it once again, Kayne West is a redhat wearing grifting MAGA lunatic whose “Presidential campaign” is to help his friend donald strip as many votes away from Joe Biden as they can. Chance The Rapper refusing to see that is disturbing and I guess I’ll sadly block him too. i understand Chance feels affection for his hero but you gotta leave the grenade catching to bruno mars. he should implement a criteria for defending Kanye like ""consult john legend"" or ""log off"" or something I just woke up and saw chance trending I was just hoping my boy was safe and like didn t catch corona or something. If you guys are just flaming him for not liking Biden and being pro Kanye I think it s fair carry on lmao Bennett even called out some critics for being so extreme, deeming them“racist.”Despite the criticism, the rapper tweeted later that he still does not agree with people’s support for Biden. I finally got the answer now. I understand. Yall trust Biden more than yall trust Ye. I think I understand why, I just don’t feel the same way. The rapper even cleverly tweeted about the phenomenon of the woke mob turning on him, later releasing a message that he called his attempt to“get down from this hill without falling and dying.” Ok this is me slowly trying to get down from this hill without falling and dying:Whoever you vote for I hope they abolish the prison system as we know it, honor black reparations and all treaties with Indigenous folk and lastly end homelessness. Whomever that may be God bless em His effort to save face with the left did not stop there. Bennett even rejected support from actor Terry Crews, who recentlyfoundhimself in the firing line from the politically correct for daring to criticize blacklivesmatter . Ok sprinting down the hill now:I understand the improbability of Ye winning the 46th Presidential seat and I understand that everyone voting for Biden isn’t necessarily doing so enthusiastically. I am for black liberation and do not accept my recent endorsement from Terry Crews Crews said the rapper was“thinking for himself”after a user compared the two. Crews quickly deleted his tweet after Bennett distanced himself. Don’t worry bro. I deleted ithttps://t.co/dZ8o7Szlxl Chance: Yall racist if you vote for Biden over KanyeTwitter: You are wrongChance: I will not apologize no matter what yall sayTerry Crews: Chance the Rapper is rightChance:pic.twitter.com/pUDFTWz6oL While Bennett is taking the backlash against him in good stride and with humor, the reaction itself is quite disturbing and part of a trend that relates back to the binary political thinking many critics of the president are trapped in. And his own backstepping shows the fear this groupthink is creating. These Trump Derangement Syndrome-suffering social justice warriors are willing to wave off numerous, legitimate reasons to not support Biden simply because doing so presents the possibility of Trump actually getting re-elected and, you know, Orange Man bad and all that. That derangement has now extended to West, who was already becoming apariahon the left thanks to his past support for Trump. Bennett presented a question that every Biden supporter should be asking themselves: why would he be better than a potential third ticket option like West? While Trump gets accused of being“racist”despite helping to make major progress on issues like prison reform through theFirst Step Act, Biden has been in DC for decades and doesn’t have a whole lot to show for it. Well, that’s not entirely true. Biden does have the support of questionablelegislationlike the 1994 Crime Bill, allegations of sexual assault, inappropriatetouching, suggestions ofcorruption, plus his ability to somehow be more gaffe-prone than stream-of-consciousness Trump. Any logical-thinking society would be looking for another option, you might think. But devoted Trump haters cannot think straight when the possibility of a President West or re-elected Trump comes into the picture. Yet this anxiety is not driven by any real hard facts. Sure, West sometimes seems like even he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, but the same can be said for his presumptive competitors. At least he has an excuse: he’s an artist. And if we are taking the prospect of a West presidency seriously, the conversation should not exclusively be about Trump. West has spoken about mental health issues, the drug war, prison reform, and much more in the past. His wife has become a surprising advocate for prison reform, even getting multiple people out of hefty sentences for non-violent crimes. His other high-profile supporter happens to be the guy whomanagedto send Americans into space for the first time in years. National conversations appear to be driven more and more by the digital hall monitors of the world though, and this has given rise to cancel culture and binary thinking on steroids. Criticize blacklivesmatter ? There is no conversation. You’re cancelled. Suggest that perhaps we should rethink promoting gender change operations to children?Cancelled. Question the idea of choosing between a man who doesn’t know where he is half the time and one who tweets at four in the morning? Get out of here. Start saving face fast before you get — you guessed it — cancelled. With the modern left, you’re either with them or against them. But this mentality has no place in politics or culture. We aren’t stuck in some lame George Lucasscript. We are in a world that is not black and white. If these critics would take their blinkers off and look at situations without an anti-Trump agenda in their heads, perhaps real debate could make a comeback. We could be open to third party candidates, however unique. We could choose not to dismiss a black man when he chooses to disagree with black activists. We could have discussions like human beings. That’s all Bennett was trying to do. Have a discussion. But real discussions have been cancelled and replaced by cancel culture promoters frothing at the mouth to destroy and vilify anything that dares to have a thought not pre-approved by politically correct Twitter mobs. One of those thoughts is now support for President Kanye West. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"13 Jul, 2020",Wayne Dupree: The Left is showing epic panic because they know a November loss is on their doorstep,"The Left’s anger is intense because they were so close to success with their riots, and now they’re terrified Joe Biden will lose his election showdown with Donald Trump. Wayne Dupreewas recently invited to the White House to talk to President Trump on messaging to the black community. He was named in Newsmax’s top 50 Influential African-American Republicans in 2017, and, in 2016, served as a board member of the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump. Before entering politics, he served for eight years in the US Air Force. His website is here:www.waynedupree.com. Follow him on Twitter@WayneDupreeShow I understand the anger and the impulse to vent about it, but this is not the time. Venting may help you feel better, but it doesn t help the cause, it only encourages others to think it s a lost cause, so why bother? It’s time to put things in the proper perspective, which is that the re-election of President Trump takes priority over your anxiety. It s time to stand your ground, regardless of your fears. It’s time to“man up.” The American Left has taken the hammer and sickle of Marxism and is using them to trample out the vintage where the fields of liberty were born. To them, anything in writing must be destroyed because that is history. That explains why they must topple statues and ban books, and even thought. To feel anger, one must have thought, and that s suddenly passé. You would be better off in a zoo according to the Left, whose candidate for office belongs in an assisted living facility. Without thought, the great masses become sheep, all the more easily led and controlled. And what is control? As George Orwell said:“He who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the present controls the past.” The elite has taken that phrase, and they control the press and the courts; therefore they get to define the present, the past, and the future. They have loosed the Marxist lightning of their terrible swift swords, and with that, their truth is marching on most social media sites as well as the reliable propaganda outlets. And presto chango! In just a matter of months, a new crime has arisen, white privilege. Does that call for anger or merely relating the facts? But who controls the facts, and what is the outcome when facts are ignored? For instance, look at James Comey and his statement that Hillary Clinton couldn t be convicted of a crime. She may have committed a crime, but presto chango, she s been washed clean by the magic of a press release. Then there s the other side of the coin. Trump stands convicted of every social faux pas imaginable, and all press releases related to him bring into focus his Dorian Gray moment. The anger of the Left is so intense because they were so close to success. Any candidate but President Trump would have folded under the pressure. The Left knows their screed of rioting and destruction has a limited shelf life. They pulled it out too early because they are panicking. But if you re angry or sad, you re still human. And if you re a thinking sapient, then you re a criminal under the new regime. To them, your constitutional rights are a matter of abject scorn because you re a matter of abject scorn, a deplorable. The Left is attempting an Atlas Shrugged moment, where every white person alive must be made aware they have nothing to offer to the woke society. And there will be no Winston Smith coming to clear you of the charges. If you show anger, you are still thinking, and your thoughts are a danger to the elite. While the elite sit back and count their ducats, nothing is too high for them to sacrifice to get back the reins of power they lost when the public arose and attempted to throw off the shackles of the NWO and globalism. By the way, while an increase in gun possession can be intimidating, my bigger concern is the ability of said new owners to use their guns effectively when needed. Owning is much different than using. Are these people taking any classes on gun use? I have a fear of someone buying a .380 and then buying a box of .45 shells because the box said“cartridges”and they were cheaper. Here s another take on today s situation. If Donald Trump is SOOOO terrible, there must be a million reasons why you should not vote for him. Saying he is a meanie is not sufficient. The Left cannot articulate a policy of his that disqualifies him. Other than, of course, his desire not to have open borders. If the Dems want to run on open borders, they are free to. Maybe they are for allowing China to cheat on trade deals. They should run on that. Maybe for tearing down all our monuments. They should run on it. Heck, they are. Our leader is President Trump. Every one of the rest of us should do whatever we can to help and avoid doing the things that are not helpful. Whining about your fears does not help him get re-elected and could hurt the cause by dispiriting others. As I said earlier, man up and control your emotions rather than allow your anxiety to control you. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

Anti-white racism will make it impossible,"Hollywood’s suffocating new wave of identity politics targets white men, and movies and TV will suffer significantly as a result.

His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Hollywood, despite its reputation as a liberal bastion, has long been a hothouse of vicious reactionary sentiments. For example, the anti-communist mania of the late 1940s and ‘50s was a particularly shameful time in Hollywood’s history. It was during this Red Scare that Hollywood studios created a blacklist where any person thought to be a communist or associated with communists, regardless of their ability, was barred from working in the industry. Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee used the threat of the Hollywood blacklist to force many artists to become informers on their colleagues in order to maintain their livelihoods. Not surprisingly, as the blacklivesmatter panic now rages, Hollywood is once again succumbing to the hideous siren’s call of dehumanization and discrimination. Except this time the accusation isn’t about communism, but rather,“Are you now, or have you ever been, a white man?” The Red Scare is now the White Male Scare. In Hollywood’s current climate of rabid, politically correct, social-justice hysteria, the message is clear: group identity trumps individual talent, skill and artistry, always and every time. The black die has been cast, and the end result of adhering to this devout dogma of diversity is that white men need not apply. Any white men who raise issues with this mandate are racist and will, along with anyone who openly associates with them, be canceled. A recentexampleof this was when black filmmaker Ri-Karlo Handy put out a call on a Facebook group of film professionals for“black union editors.”When white editors took offense at this rank racialization, they were called racist, andoneeven lost his job over it. Black filmmaker Ava DuVernay responded bytweeting“to the white men… if you don’t get that job you were up for, kindly remember… bias can go both ways. This is 2020 speaking.” This is reminiscent of black filmmaker Jordan Peelesaying,“I don’t see myself casting a white dude as the lead in my movie.”Imagine if someone said either of those things about black or Jewish people instead of“white men.” Apparently, DuVernay and Peele feel the best way to fight past racism is with more racism. How ethically and morally repugnant of them. This whole anti-white-male identity politics revolution began in the wake of the #MeToo movement, where studios, in their typical reactionary style, became adamant about telling female-centric stories, regardless of their quality, and hiring women to either write, direct, star in or produce them, regardless of their talent level or ability. This approach resulted in the murderer’s row of cinematic garbage that was ‘Charlie’s Angels,’ ‘Birds of Prey,’ ‘Ocean’s 8,’ ‘What Men Want,’ ‘The Hustle,’ ‘Late Night’and ‘Mary Queen of Scots.’ Now, with blacklivesmatter the movement du jour, Hollywood is even more ferociously committed to disregarding individual talent, skill, experience and artistry (of white men in particular) in their hiring practices in favor of identity politics. There are many who’ll cheer this anti-white male racism and say that white men have discriminated for years and they deserve the backlash. That may, or may not, be true, but regardless, these folks are cutting off their cinematic noses to spite their white-man-hating face. The dark secret people working within the industry know, but are too scared to say publicly, is that this aggressive identity politics not only will destroy the careers and lives of completely innocent, ordinary working-class folks in front of and behind the camera, but will be catastrophic for the art of cinema and the entertainment business. Despite what the uninitiated think, making movies and TV shows is extremely difficult, making good ones is even more difficult, and making great ones is nearly impossible. Industry professionals understand that talent and skill must be the absolute top priority when hiring, or the end product will ultimately suffer greatly. No one would dare say this publicly of course, at least not while the Woke Inquisition rages and cancel culture reigns supreme. But just like the vast majority of talented and skilled people in the NBA are black (despite black men making up only 6.5 percent of the US population), the cold, hard truth is that not all, but the vast majority of skilled people in Hollywood are white men. That is not racist. That is reality. Unlike the woke cultists, I’m not interested in sacrificing quality on the altar of identity. I don’t care about identity. I only care about cinema. Like all true cinephiles, I want the most talented individuals to get hired, regardless of their group identity, in order to ensure the best movies get made. Recently, black actor Anthony Mackie, the star of Marvel’s ‘Falcon and the Winter Soldier,’ unintentionallyadmittedhe felt the same way while, ironically, complaining about Marvel’s lack of diversity. “My big push with Marvel is hire the best person for the job. Even if it means we are going to get the best two women, we’re going to get the best two men. Fine.” I’d like to think that when Mr Mackie says“we,”he means the human race and not the black race, and that he would be“fine”if the“best person for the job”were a white man. But considering the sentiment in Hollywood right now, I sincerely doubt it. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"13 Jul, 2020","Shelter in places apart and unequal: Topple all the monuments you want, but the real racism’s going unaddressed","America pulls down monuments to racist oppressors, renames streets and paints blacklivesmatter all over them. But the real inequalities of cities like Chicago – rooted in class as well as race – are left to fester. ByPaul Street,the author of numerous books, including They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy (Routledge, 2014) and The Empire s New Clothes: Barack Obama in the Real World of Power (Routledge, 2011). Paul Street’s latest book isHollow Resistance: Obama, Trump, and the Politics of Appeasement(CounterPunch Books, September 2020). Follow Paul on Twitter@Streetwriter17 It is good to see Confederate war memorials coming down and under attack in the American South. The Confederacy was a treasonous campaign to keep black people in bondage. It arose and seceded from the United States, leading to a Civil War that killed more than half a million Americans, because top southern slaveholdersdeterminedthat the presidency of Abraham Lincoln represented a mortal threat to the forced labor and torture system that was black chattel slavery. But symbolic change only goes so far. America can take down all the racist historical monuments it wants. It can strip slave owners’ and slave traders’ names from every structure they befoul. It can paint“ blacklivesmatter ”on every major thoroughfare in the nation. But substance matters more than symbols, just as deeds matter more than words (you know, like“hope”and“change”). The technically black Barack Obama held the White House in the land of cotton slavery for eight years. During his presidency, Black Americans experienced an epic collapse in networth.“Racially disparate mass incarceration”(a nice academic phrase for the disproportionate mass arrest and imprisonment of black and brown people) and racist police brutality proceeded apace while liberals congratulated themselves for having voted (twice) for a (deeply conservative) first blackpresident(an imperial Wall Street president who lectured poor blacks on their own responsibility for their poverty while bailing out financial institutions that collapsed black wealth along with the US and global economies). Take my hometown, Chicago, the one-third black city that Obama deceptively claimed to hail from. It recently elected a black, female and gay mayor (a symbolic identity politics trifecta!) and named one its leading downtown streets after the 20th century black civil rights activist Ida B. Wells.  Black people are highly visible on the city’s nightly television news teams, in its sports and entertainment culture and across its entire roster of elected officials. Good. Has symbolic change challenged the massive concentration of deep Black poverty across vast ghettoized swaths of the city’s South and West Sides? Has it brought new opportunity and uplifted those communities? Has superficially integrated Chicago made any substantive effort to reverse the flows of profit, development, andprivilegefrom the richest and whitest parts of the city and metropolitan area to the poorest and most black parts of the metropolis?  Has it switched tax incrementfinancingsurpluses and other government subsidies from lining the already deep pockets of downtown developers to creating affordable housing, livable wage jobs, medical resources, and green spaces in the city’s multiply oppressed Blackcommunities? Has it begun to compensate those communities for more than acenturyof harsh housing and school segregation, restrictive covenants, red-lining, disinvestment, employment discrimination, gentrification, and police-state torture and terrorism? Has Chicago moved to dismantle the giant racist holding pen and coronavirus breedinggroundcalled Cook County Jail?  Has it de-funded its viciously racist and militarized policedepartment, diverting the taxpayer fortune it spends on repression to social protection and enrichment in the city’s communities of greatest need? No, it has not.  And it’s the same in every other American metropolis. Americans need to think about“place”in social as well as spatial terms. They also need to understand the longstanding core national problems of race at a deeper, class-informed level beyond just the color of faces in high places and symbols in public spaces. They could start by reflecting on how differently the phrase“shelter in place”plays out across the nation’s interwoven boundaries of race and class. Think about the spaces where disproportionately middle- and upper-class people have“sheltered in place”in Chicago this year. Comfortable city residents have been harboring in the vast, predominantly white affluent stretches of the city’sNorth Sidealong with other cozy semi-integrated pockets in South Side neighborhoods like Hyde Park and Beverly. Residents of these pleasing neighborhoods work from often spacious, nicely furnished, and well-stocked homes, in good-paying jobs that come with gold-plated health insurance plans. They have high-end coffee shops, health carry-outs, doctors’ and dentist offices, full-service grocery stores with organic food, and well-kept city parks and more nearby. (Some of these neighborhoods’ residents will almost sheepishly tell you that Covid-19 has been a delightful opportunity to work in the comfort of their homes without commutes, business suits, and direct oversight from senior authorities). Things are different in the shockingly impoverished and jobless ghettoes on Chicago’s South and West Sides. There, black Americans shelter in savagely separate and unequal places.  Grocery stores, banks, professional services, and green space are shockingly scarce in black Chicago. So are job networks and decent, well-funded schools. Sidewalks and parking lots in these neighborhoods are strewn with broken glass alongside boarded-up storefronts and ubiquitous liquor stores. Air conditioning is a luxury and social distancing is difficult in overcrowded, rent-racked apartments with shelves that are often all-too-bare. Heavily armed police patrol warily and menacingly. Life expectancy, already low, is plummeting in these neighborhoods as residents struggle with numerous pre-existing“co-morbidities”– including the lack of health insurance and a scarcity of medical services – that make Covid-19 especially dangerous. To make matters worse, Black Chicagoans have been especially exposed to the virus thanks to their disproportionate presence in front-line service jobs.“Working from home,”noted the journalist Carlos Ballesteros last April in theChicago Sun Times,“is not an option for most Black and Latino workers during the coronavirus crisis.” None of this is unique to Chicago. America is telling tens of millions of black Americans to shelter in savagely unequal place as the uncompensated and living, compound-interestlegaciesof slavery, Jim Crow, ghettoization, and more steal and maim black lives on an elevated scale in the coronavirus era. Is it any wonder that many urban black Americans exploded in rage after George Floyd was killed by white police officers in Minneapolis? And that some Black Americans came out of their assigned places to attack property and appropriate goods not just in their own assigned communities but in downtown commercial centers like Chicago’s Loop and Midtown Manhattan? Or that urban black America could be looking at a long, hot violence-pronesummeras misery mounts in the nation’s worst-off places? More statues will come down, more“ blacklivesmatter ”signs will go up, more street names will change. Fine. What’s really required is a massive redirection of wealth and resources understood as reparations not just for past racial oppression but for ongoing systemic and institutional racism, deeply understood – and a related frontal assault on the soulless class-rule profits system that has always underpinned American racism. “The real issue to be faced”beyond surface matters like the technical skin color of an elected official, the socialist Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote near the end of his life,“is the radical reconstruction of society itself.”There’s a word for that kind of reparation: revolution.

"11 Jul, 2020",‘Please pass the guilt’: SJW grifters running woke dinner scam on wealthy whites are amplifying the racism they claim to fight,"Redefining racism as the Original Sin tainting all white people has spawned a parade of grifters. If ‘anti-racist’ literature isn’t your thing, you can pay a pair of white-hating women to abuse you and your friends over dinner. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Former Democratic congressional candidate Saira Rao and her 2018 campaign staffer Regina DiAngelo have found their niche extorting thousands of dollars from guilty white women in return for harassing them about their inborn racism over food and drinks in what sounds like a spinoff of the race-horror flick “Get Out” but is actually a much-hyped “anti-racist” consciousness-raising event called “Race 2 Dinner.” Buoyed by universally positive coverage from a media establishment that can’t get enough of sliming white women as malevolent Karens, R2D has blossomed over the past year from its initial word-of-mouth spread to taking corporate bookings. Rao and DiAngelo make no secret of why they’ve chosen the dinner format as the ideal setting to lambaste their paler sisters. Because white women are “nice” and “polite,” they wouldn’t think of leaving the dinner table, no matter how uncomfortable they get, Rao explained in a recentpodcast, pointing out that the kind of confrontational conversation that characterizes a typical R2D session might otherwise send these avatars of white fragility running out of a conference or a lecture hall. The pair neatly conflate class and race by charging that high entry fee, which lends an unmistakable aura of “fin-dom"" (financial domination) to the proceedings. Wealthy women who can afford to drop thousands of dollars to be harangued by a pair of ultra-woke harpies spitting the kind of negative racial generalizations that would be cause for cancellation if directed at any race other than whites are hardly representative of white people as a whole – working-class whites have more in common with their black counterparts than with the financiers who’ve bled the US economy dry. Pinning the sins of the .01 percent on “white people,” popular as it is in 2020, remains fundamentally inaccurate and will not lead to the kind of societal change that many people (ofallraces) agree is needed. That seems to be the point – Rao and DiAngelo want to reinforce the power structure, not dismantle it, and they’re experts at the divide-and-conquer politics used so effectively by the ruling class throughout history to keep the poor in their place. Just as the Anti-Defamation League must convince its donors that there are neo-Nazis hiding around every corner to get them to cough up those big checks, to the point ofmassaging statisticsto make it seem that hate crimes are through the roof when this is not the case, the R2D crew and others like them must conjure the specter of race-based hatred in order to get people to buy their dinnertime dom sessions. It helps that their version of “anti-racism” is in fact quite racist, requiring white people to evaluate every situation based on the skin colors of the players rather than on the personalities, character traits, class dynamics, or other more relevant aspects of the situation. And their business model is bolstered by the fact that wealthy white women may find a certain novelty, even titillation, in being verbally assaulted by the vengeful pair, especially Rao, who – DiAngelorepeatedly jokedon a podcast back in April – “hates white people.” It’s the same kind of role-reversal thrill their Wall Street husbands might seek in a dominatrix’s dungeon where they’re ordered to get on all fours and bark like a dog. After a long, stressful day oppressing the working class, there’s nothing like a nice professional humiliation session to wash those cares away. The women of Race 2 Dinner are far from the first to see the potential in expanding fin-dom (whose “wallet-slaves” are typically male) into an equal-opportunity wealth extraction scheme within the racial framework. They’re merely taking the baton passed by ‘White Fragility’ author Robin DiAngelo (no relation, apparently) and running with it. Despite being white herself, DiAngelo has made a profitable career out of haranguing white people for their inborn racism, convincing them every fiber of their being resonates with prejudice against black people and the only solution is to become “less white.” As with R2D, this means sitting down, shutting up, and (the important part) paying up – DiAngelo will come consult on your corporate culture, but her disgust will be palpable. The parallels with fin-dom, which often includes emotional or literal blackmail, psychological drama, and a liberal helping of shame, are obvious. But some specters, once conjured, are difficult to lay to rest. The latest wave of outrage grifters may think they know what they’re doing (and indeed, they’re experts at lining their own pockets) but the racism they conjure may outlast them. Many whites believe it’s unfair that they should be blamed for the crimes of those long dead, especially those whose ancestors arrived in the US when slavery was already outlawed, and many blacks see the DiAngelos and Raos of the world as hampering rather than helping the cause of black liberation. As books like White Fragility dominate the best-seller list and white women eager for social cachet add their names to the no doubt prodigious waiting list on the Race 2 Dinner website, Americans should stop to ask who (beyond these low-level grifters) benefits from white and black people being pitted against one another, and who is running a fin-dom scam on the entire nation on a much grander scale.

"9 Jul, 2020",‘Pull up your pants & finish school’: Would CNN s Don Lemon cancel himself over shockingly unwoke 2013 tips to black community?,"A vintage clip of CNN anchor Don Lemon telling black people to act civilized and disregard “street culture” has the woke pundit’s detractors’ jaws on the floor, wondering what happened to him over the intervening seven years. In the 2013 clip, Lemon praises Fox News host Bill O’Reilly as the Republican pundit decries the “disintegration of the African-American family,” even arguing O’Reilly “doesn’t go far enough” when he denounces “street culture.” The video was posted to social media by “Panda Tribune” on Wednesday and quickly circulated among conservatives, who had a hard time reconciling this Lemon with his painfully-PC modern-day counterpart. 🚨📽️Just Watch📽️🚨This is a real video from 2013.It is only edited for time (to fit Twitter’s 2:20 limit), but the context is unchanged.The full video is in the link below.I must admit: Don Lemon genuinely seemed to care about black lives in 2013https://t.co/XSf3nQua7opic.twitter.com/kBFa6SPpH1 Ordering black people to “pull up [their] pants,” stop using “the n-word” and littering, “finish school,” and wait until they’re married to reproduce, the CNN personality of seven years ago comes off as borderline unrecognizable to those who know him as the ultra-woke face of the “Orange Man Bad” network. Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired the segment on his show Wednesday night, marveling that if Lemon or one of his colleagues came out with those lines in 2020, “that would be their last live broadcast ever - they’d be fired immediately.” This is an absolutely staggering take down of Don Lemon by@TuckerCarlson.pic.twitter.com/Gm7P5li6P6 Glenn Beck’s The Blazeconcurred, asking “what are the chances 2020 Don Lemon would cancel 2013 Don Lemon?” Many on the right wondered what had happened to 2013’s Lemon, whom one usercalled“an uplifting news voice for positive change” turned “fear mongering race baiting outrage culture grifter”… He s seems intelligent, reasonable, and well-balanced here. What happened to him? Who took Don s body over to do that? He actually made sense back then. …or even the Lemon of 2014, who’d said he was “tired” of talking about race - but just this week debuted a podcast called “Silence is Not an Option” in which he talks about nothing else. Don Lemon was tired of talking about race years ago. What happened to him?pic.twitter.com/ZoR2CpFCV5 This is who#DonLemonused to be (and probably still really is). When he said these things he was called “Coon” and “Uncle Tom” (sound familiar?)He now hates Trump and pushes black victimhood narratives for a@CNNcheck. SAD!pic.twitter.com/7IwWmYKb8h Many blamed Trump Derangement Syndrome. I can t think of stronger evidence for the debilitating effects of TDS than 2013 Don Lemon vs 2020 Don Lemon.

"9 Jul, 2020","Lady Antebellum, renamed ‘Lady A’ in woke PR move, sues black artist who already has the name","Tennessee country rock band Lady A – known as Lady Antebellum before officially renaming itself amid 2020’s cultural purge of references to the Confederacy – is suing a black artist with the same name in a case of peak woke irony. The band’s lawyers have targeted blues singer Anita White, who also goes by “Lady A,” suing the artist over White’s “attempt to enforce purported trademarks rights in a mark that [the band] have held for more than a decade,” the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Nashville’s District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, reads. Lady Antebellum decided to change their name to Lady A because they’re woke now, only to find out a Black artist already existed under that name so now they’re suing to use the name anyways because they couldn’t come to a deal with her. Leftist virtue signaling in a nutshell. 🤦🏻‍♂️pic.twitter.com/pPHjkkdNxh The Nashville trio had reportedly been negotiating with the singer before their talks fell through, and White has now “demanded a $10 million payment,” a statement from the band alleges. Lady Antebellum officially changed its name on June 11 following weeks of anti-racism and police brutality protests triggered by the death of George Floyd, announcing it wanted to be “more inclusive.” Antebellum refers to the time period before the US Civil War, which resulted in the abolition of slavery in the US. However, Lady Antebellum claimed the band had used the “Lady A” name as early as 2006, citing a page on its website that referred to the nickname and referencing a 2010 filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office. With no opposition to their registering the trademark for “entertainment purposes, including live musical performances and streaming musical programming” – plus later expansions into musical recordings and clothing – the band insisted its ownership of the name was uncontested. “Prior to 2020, White did not challenge, in any way, [the band’s] open, obvious, and widespread nationwide and international use of the LADY A mark as a source indicator” for its music, performances, or merchandise, the suit alleged – as if the Seattle-based blues singer would have been following the legal filings of a band on the other side of the country. White, who has released several albums as Lady A, had harsh words for the country rock band she claimed was opportunistically piggybacking off “a moment in time” represented by the blacklivesmatter protests sweeping the nation. “If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before,” she told Rolling Stone, adding “It shouldn’t have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize their name had a slave reference to it.” Lady Antebellum, because of racist connotations, changed it s name to Lady A (which still stands for Antebellum) is suing Anita White, who has gone by Lady A for over 20 years. And I am showing Anita s face, not Lady Antebellum because F that noise.https://t.co/Q0x9OPVDCbpic.twitter.com/D4LcuV7YUq While the band’s lawyers acknowledged White had performed under the name “Lady A” since at least 2010, using the name to tour and sell her music over streaming services, they pointed out that she had not trademarked the name – or if she had attempted to do so, she’d applied after Lady Antebellum had already nabbed it. However, music attorneys who spoke to Rolling Stone pointed out that White had a “common law trademark” as she’d been first to use the name in commerce. The 61-year-old singer adopted the Lady A name singing karaoke in the 1980s – long before Lady Antebellum formed in 2006 – and has performed under the name throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere under the moniker ever since. The dueling Ladies had apparently attempted to work out a legal agreement following Lady Antebellum’s name change after White called them out for allegedly stealing her name, a pact which included “continuing to share the name and supporting White’s musical career.” However, the blues singer told Newsday last month that she “no longer trust[ed]” the band, claiming “their camp is trying to erase me.” She told Rolling Stone that she had a business trademark for Lady A LLC, slamming the chart-topping country band for failing to even run a search before adopting her stage name as their own. “For them to not even reach out is pure privilege,” she said. Lady Antebellum changed its name to Lady A, “the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start,” last month amid a massive cultural backlash against references to the Confederacy that has included the pulling down of monuments and attempts to rename US military bases. Fellow country band the Dixie Chicks followed suit less than a week later, renaming itself “the Chicks” in a move that was widely mocked. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"8 Jul, 2020",‘Mind your own business’: Foreign Ministry tells US to look in the mirror after it accused Russia of attack on ‘media freedom’,"Russia has hit back at US Embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross after she tweeted that recent arrests of Russian journalists are “starting to look like a concerted campaign against media freedom.” ByJonny Tickle The accusation comes after the detention of former journalist Ivan Safronov, currently an adviser to the head of Russian Space Agency Roscosmos. The Federal Security Service (FSB) accused Safronov of working for Czech intelligence and transmitting classified information about Russian arms sales to foreign countries. If found guilty, Safronov could face up to 20 years in prison. “#Russiathrough the eyes of the media in 2020” is a more current topic. Watching arrest after arrest of Russian journalists – it’s starting to look like a concerted campaign against#MediaFreedom.@mfa_russia Ross was referring to a comment by Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who, on July 7, spoke at an online conference called‘The world through the eyes of the media in 2020’. Zakharova claimed that the US has moved away from the concept of“freedom of the media, freedom of speech, protection of the rights of journalists and generally understanding what freedom of speech is.” Safronov’s arrest is the latest in a succession of journalists to be involved in the criminal system. Earlier this week, Svetlana Prokopyeva was convicted for‘justifying terrorism’, after writing an opinion article explaining the possible reason that a man detonated a bomb in a local FSB office. In late May, Novaya Gazeta journalist Ilya Azar was detained for 10 days for protesting the arrest of Vladimir Vorontsov, an activist focused on the actions of police. Most famously, in 2019, Meduza journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested and charged with a drug-related crime by Moscow law enforcement. He was later released after evidence emerged that drugs were planted on him by police officers. Mind your own business. On Twitter, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the US Embassy to“mind [their] own business.” In recent months, freedom of the press in the US has come to the forefront of international attention after a series of televised detainments during blacklivesmatter protests. Several American journalists also reported being the targets of violence, with police even shooting a camera crew in Louisville, Kentucky. This just happened on live tv. Wow, what a douche bag.pic.twitter.com/dQKheEcCvb According to a tell-all book by former US National Security Advisor John Bolton, US President Donald Trump has also shown dismay for journalists, calling for them to be“executed.”The quote was backed up by Guy Snodgrass, a speechwriter for former US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. ""Bolton alleges Trump privately told him reporters deserve prison. ""These people should be executed. They are scumbags.""""Can confirm.

The billionaire music artist turned sneaker designer told Forbes that he was running to win in November – even though it is too late for him to register as a candidate in some states.

Although billing himself as an independent, West says he is forming a new Birthday Party to defeat Democrat Joe Biden and Republican incumbent Donald Trump. He chose the name“because when we win, it’s everybody’s birthday.” He is reportedly being advised by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and he has selected a little-known preacher from Wyoming, Michelle Tidball, as his running mate. West announced that their campaign slogan is“YES!”– not“YEP”or“YEAH,”he clarified. His platform contains an eclectic array of positions. West told Forbes that he was“extremely cautious”about efforts to develop a vaccine for coronavirus, claiming that“they are trying to chip us”and that the vaccine represents“the mark of the beast.”The billionaire also came out strongly against abortion, accusing Planned Parenthood of doing the“Devil’s work.” West acknowledged that he hasn’t hammered out a foreign policy yet, as he wants to“focus on ourselves first”– a position which sounds similar to Trump’s ‘America First’ worldview. He also has no position on taxes, but he promised to consult“experts that serve God and come back with the best solution.” The Birthday Party has very strong feelings about fun, however. “When I’m president, let’s also have some fun. Let’s get past all the racism conversation, let’s empower people with 40 acres and a mule, let’s give some land, that’s the plan,”he told Forbes. The reference comes from a post-Civil War plan which called for free land for newly freed slaves in the South. The rapper, once a vocal Trump supporter, said he was dismayed by reports claiming the president had taken refuge in the White House bunker during blacklivesmatter protests in Washington, DC. However, he claimed that the current president could potentially be part of his political vision, and said he had no issue with siphoning off black votes from Biden, even if it hands Trump another four years. West urged both Trump and Biden to“bow out”of the race, saying that he alone was“in the service of God.” However, the Birthday Party candidate was noticeably less charitable when describing Biden, calling the Democrat“not special”and arguing that it’s a“form of racism and white supremacy”to tell black people that they must vote Democrat. Biden had claimed in an interview that“you ain’t black”unless you support him in November – comments which he was later forced to walk back. According to Bloomberg, the pop culture icon has yet to file the necessary paperwork to have his name appear on state ballots. In fact, the outlet reported that West has yet to take any meaningful action that would make him eligible to win the White House in November. West announced his presidential bid last week on Twitter. In a recent interview, Trump called the rapper’s candidacy“interesting”but argued he had little chance of winning because he launched his campaign too late. Think your friends would be interested?

"7 Jul, 2020","I was born in New York, and I’ve never seen the city so scared and uninhabitable. I fear we’re on the brink of a second civil war","Residents are fearful to go out after dark. The police are afraid to patrol, and violent crime, murder and looting are rampant, while businesses are collapsing. And war has already been declared on our values and culture.

Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi The world is under attack from a well-organised and well-funded group of anarchists who have launched an ideological cultural revolution to further globalism. The blacklivesmatter movement, the riots, looting, protests and Covid-19 are all about partisan politics and the 2020 presidential election. blacklivesmatter co-founder Patrisse Cullors summarized:“We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories… Our goal isto get Trump outof the White House.”I believe blacklivesmatter . But I m not convinced that black lives are the first priority of the # blacklivesmatter movement. We need to learn lessons from our country s past without romanticising that past. Every civil society needs baselines. Those baselines have to include a colour-blind meritocracy and the rule of law applied equally to everyone. Democracy, liberty, freedom and due process have to be afforded to the entire citizenry. Equality for all is necessary! Each individual has the right to celebrate history or not, but no one can rewrite or erase history and destroy statues or cultural artefacts. Antifa s tyrannical fascist fanatics, aka the mob, seek to erase history and historical figures just like ISIS and the Nazis. The Antifa mob is political and seems to be an extension of the democraticparty : a Democratic militia. The democraticparty refuses to denounce Antifa or the violence its thugs are perpetrating. The New York Times Nikole Hannah-Jones encouraged looting and destruction of property by saying that“destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan s policies for“a summer of love”led to the coldblooded murder of 19-year-old Horace Lorenzo Anderson Jr. He was shot and killed on June 20 in the crime-ridden ‘CHOP’ area established in Seattle under Durkan s watch. Durkan has acknowledged that, after allowing a police station as well as several city blocks to be taken over by violent, anarchic thugs, the crime rate spiked by a whopping 525%. On Independence Day weekend in Chicago, at least 80 people were shot, with 17 deaths reported – several of whom were children, including seven-year-old Natalia Wallace who, was brutally murdered on the lawless streets of Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot s city. And yet, nothing is being done to protect the children of Chicago. US mainstream media refuses to report the news honestly; they state their opinions as news, or they straight-up lie. Not one media outlet or blacklivesmatter conveyed outrage over the five black children murdered over this weekend. WHY? Do blacklivesmatter to blacklivesmatter ? Where is the outrage? New York City was also decimated by this revolution, and the media lied. The media failed to report the crime wave and extent of the anarchy that swept through Mayor Bill de Blasio’s utopia. Servile, lying political elites such as de Blasio and the inexperienced and unqualified democratic socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enabled the looting and property damage as they leveraged mob rule by joining the chant to“defund the police”– a chant which the NYC mayor took to heart. Police need to police, they do not need vilification. Without the police, we have total anarchy. From behind the iron gates of his family home, and protected by heavily armed guards, de Blasio decided to defund the New York Police Department by $1.5 billion. This was done at a time when violent crimes and the murder rate were skyrocketing to new highs across not just New York City, but every major city controlled by democraticparty politicians across America. NYC shootings in June were up 120%, with murders up 30%. And the 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez criticised the $1.5 billion cuts as“not enough.”Seriously? The impact of this insane policy has been a massive increase in crime in the high-crime areas of the city, and those poor souls most in need of the NYPD will not have the NYPD available on a timely basis.These elected officials forgetthat they were elected and sworn-in to protect and serve the electorate that voted them into office. No one pays taxes to allow either a pot-head or socialist ex-bartender to compromise community safety and redirect their tax dollars to “woke” causes that make the community unsafe and turn the city into Wokistan. I was born in New York City, and I have never seen the city like this. It has become uninhabitable. Businesses are gone, and Manhattan is a ghost town. At 10pm on a Saturday, the streets of midtown Manhattan are empty. NYC residents are fearful to leave their apartments after dark. The police are afraid of the citizens so they will not patrol, causing crime to escalate and making city life too dangerous. Crime is rampant, and businesses are collapsing. Sue Lee, one of Manhattan s finest tailors at Cambridge Cleaners on Second Avenue and East 39th Street, told me:“Business has dropped 80% year on year since Covid-19, and the rents have stayed too high.” The “peaceful protests” in New York City as shown by the media, and the destruction that I have witnessed, is a story of two different worlds. There’s the fantasy world of Maddow’s MSNBC and CNN, and then there’s the reality of New York City, the place I am in – a city that looks like a deserted, bombed-out Iraq. The media is just making it up as they go along, and everyone is required to accept, obey and nod helplessly like a bovine and submit to all of the mob s dictates without question. Get on your knees and beg forgiveness to the mob, because if you dare question these ‘elites’, you will become a target and victim. Many people have been brutally attacked on social media, fired from their jobs, vilified and denied any future opportunities to earn a living because they dared to say three words:“All lives matter.” Many of these ‘news’ agencies are run by indoctrinated, spoiled, intolerant, bratty children attempting to rewrite history. Most of the ignorant child wokesters running these legacy media icons know NOTHING about US history and abolitionism. How do the identity-politics-based tactics of these cultural Marxist, virtue-signalling wokesters differ from any fascist or fear-based tyrannical dictatorships? They don’t – when anyone disagrees, they resort to extreme violence, just like the authoritarian regime of North Korea s Kim Jong-un. Is a militant democraticparty , which cannot win at the ballot box, using civil unrest as a useful distraction to mask massive wealth inequality and the crimes committed by those who have continuously been attempting a coup d état to overthrow Trump after he dared to be elected president? It’s my judgement – and I am not alone in thinking this – that many elites in the FBI have committed serious crimes. FBI Director James Comey lied to FISA judges by signing several FISA warrants when he knew these warrants contained outrageous unsubstantiated claims. Comey used these FISA warrants to weaponize the FBI against Hillary Clinton s political opponent. Comey, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page illegally spied on Americans, including Trump and those involved in his 2016 presidential campaign, and then lied about it in a cover-up more extensive than Nixon’s Watergate one. Many others in the intelligence services were involved in this attempted coup d état of Trump, such as James Clapper and John Brennan. While many more were involved, all roads point to Hillary Clinton, and the trail of breadcrumbs, via Susan Rice (Joe Biden s likely VP hopeful should Michelle Obama reject Dementia Joe’s advances), goes all the way to Obama s desk. Some of these people will likely face indictments from US Attorney for DC John Durham later this summer. This is not unique to America. The same “one size fits all” attack is happening around the world, which just goes to demonstrate how our ruling elites say anything to get elected for four years or longer, only to do the opposite. The politicians screw the voters who elected them while selling out to the highest corporate bidders. At the same time, most of the mob remains hypnotised, watching the shiny objects dangled by the fake news media pundits. Just remember: the liberal left are inclusive, diverse, tolerant and accepting – UNTIL you offer an opposing viewpoint, at which point they become part of the violent, intolerant mob. Mob rule never ends well, and this time will be no different. The takeaway: Never trust legacy politicians, and no matter what the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, a civil war in America is likely.

"7 Jul, 2020", Shameful : Tucker Carlson under fire for claiming senator who lost legs in Iraq ‘hates America’,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson is facing fierce backlash on social media after claiming that Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a war veteran who lost both her legs in Iraq, hates America. Speaking on his show on Monday night, Carlson noted that Duckworth was a top contender to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s pick for vice president. He took particular issue with her comment to CNN that it was time to have a“national dialogue”about historical statues in the country, including those to slave-owners like Founding Father George Washington. Here s what Tucker said about Tammy Duckworth tonight that prompted her fiery response:""Most people just ignore her. But when Duckworth does speak in public, you re reminded what a deeply silly and unimpressive person she is... These people actually hate America.""pic.twitter.com/yKZVNfwYFC Carlson began the segment by declaring sarcastically that people are“not supposed to criticize Tammy Duckworth”because of her military service, as if to brace his audience for the impending onslaught. He then proceeded to call her a“deeply silly and unimpressive person”who“most people just ignore.” Carlson said Duckworth was not seriously looking for a dialogue and claimed it was“no longer a question”that people like her“hate America.” “Can you really lead a country that you hate?”he asked, comparing the notion of Duckworth being vice president to a parent hating her own children. Unsurprisingly, the controversial monologue raised many eyebrows on social media. Netizens were so up in arms about Carlson’s“shameful”comment that his name trended on Twitter on Tuesday. One commenter suggested Carlson had""lost his dignity""while others called for the host to issue a public apology. The comments also prompted a reply from Duckworth herself. The double amputee senator fired back at the host on Twitter, asking him to“walk a mile in her legs”before telling her she does not love America. Does@TuckerCarlsonwant to walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not I love America? Simply put:Serving our country, Sen. Tammy Duckworth lost her legs.Serving Fox News, Tucker Carlson lost his dignity. Ironically, Duckworth had already seemingly tried to backpedal on her comments about historical statues, perhaps unbeknownst to Carlson. “This has never been a debate about honoring the complex legacy of those who actually helped build our great nation,”shesaidon Twitter after previously receiving a backlash of her own. The issue of whether or not to remove controversial historical statues has been the subject of tense debate in recent weeks following the killing of George Floyd and renewed blacklivesmatter demonstrations. Some protesters have not been interested in debate, however, and have simply torn down the old statues themselves. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"6 Jul, 2020",Where are the protests? Firearms overtake fireworks as shootings over July 4th weekend leave scores dead in big US cities,"The Independence Day weekend turned deadly across the US as 77 people were shot in Chicago alone, continuing a spate of violence that has plagued largely black neighborhoods amid anti-racism protests focused on police brutality. Tony Cox,a US-based journalist whose work has been published by Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. Between July 3 and July 5, 13 people were fatally shot in Chicago. The latest violence wasn’t out of character in a city that earned the nickname“Chiraq”– likening the bloodshed to that in war-torn Iraq – and where around 80 percent of homicide victims each year are black, according to police data. Father’s Day weekend last month saw 104 shootings and 14 dead. The city suffered its deadliest day in at least six decades on May 31, when 18 people were killed. Chicago had 1,384 shootings in the first six months of 2020, a 45 percent increase from the same point in 2019, according topolice figures. New York City, Atlanta, Milwaukee and other large US cities also registered a spike in violence in recent weeks. The Big Apple had 30 shootings, including 10 fatalities, on July 5 alone. NYPD responded to a 20-year high of 205 shooting incidentsin June, compared with 89 a year earlier. The carnage is taking place at the same time that activist group blacklivesmatter is leading anti-racism protests across the US, after 46-year-old black man George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. According to data compiled by theWashington Post, nine unarmed black people were shot dead by police in all of 2019, in a nation of 330 million people. Some 1,000 people are killed at the hands of US police annually, and in most cases the shootings are ruled justified. African-Americans accounted for29 percentof those deaths last year, in cases where the ethnicity of the deceased was reported. While unjustified shootings by police are tragic, civilian gun violence can be just as heartbreaking and senseless to those involved, such as the July 4 killing of an 8-year-old black girl in Atlanta.Police sayat least two men opened fire after the car in which Secoriya Williamson was riding crossed an illegal barricade that had been set up by protesters. “They say blacklivesmatter ,”said the girl’s father.“You killed your own.” Speaking at apress conferenceafter the killing, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms lamented a recent surge in black-on-black shootings. “We re doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force. We ve had over 75 shootings in the city over the past several weeks. You can t blame this on a police officer,”she said. blacklivesmatter activists have responded to reports of black-on-black violence bydenouncingthem as attempts to deflect from the“unique horror”of police brutality. One of their demands has been to defund police departments across the nation, already resulting in a $1 billion cut to the New York City police budget. Critics of the movement point to a 2016 US Department of Justice stud that found that a spike in inner-city homicides may be attributable to the“Ferguson effect”– a breakdown in trust between police and community members, that occurred after the 2014 killing of an 18-year-old black man by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

"4 Jul, 2020",Austrian Grand Prix: Valtteri Bottas on top as Mercedes DOMINATES qualifying at the Red Bull Ring (VIDEO),"Finnish ace Valtteri Bottas was the class of the field in qualifying for the first Formula 1 Grand Prix of the COVID-19-delayed 2020 season, as he pipped teammate Lewis Hamilton in a dominant session for Mercedes in Austria. The reigning constructors world champions were a class above the rest of the field, with Bottas and Hamilton registering qualifying lap times more than half a second faster than their nearest challenger, Red Bull s Max Verstappen. The Mercedes team sported their new all-black livery to support anti-racism initiatives, while Hamilton sported a special "" blacklivesmatter "" helmet as the team followed up on their headline-making attire with an equally notable performance on the track. Hamilton topped the timesheets throughout free practice, but Bottas chipped away at his teammate s advantage to eventually surpass him during qualifying. The Finn s lap of 1:02.939 saw him head the grid for Sunday s 2020 curtain-raiser, with Hamilton just 12 thousands of a second behind. Not how@ValtteriBottaswould ve imagined taking pole, but it s career pole number 12 for the Finn!#AustrianGP🇦🇹#F1pic.twitter.com/x3jZEzG2V6 Verstappen headed the rest of the field, which saw the remainder of the 10-car Q3 field covered by less than eight tenths of a second, hinting at a close-fought race for the midfield positions. But while the midfield entries may be steeling themselves for a possible shot at a podium, the Ferrari team were left licking their wounds after a nightmare session. Former world champion Sebastian Vettel – who Ferrari announced wouldn t be retained next season – failed to make it through to Q3, while Charles Leclerc struggled to squeeze enough pace from the car to challenge the front runners and ended up seventh.

"1 Jul, 2020","WATCH: blacklivesmatter protesters in New York CHAZ mock cops over college education, call officer black Judas ","Tensions were high in New York’s so-called ‘City Hall Autonomous Zone’ (CHAZ) on Tuesday night, with protesters mocking cops over their education. The scenes left the demonstrators facing accusations of snobbery and privilege. Eyewitness footage shot outside City Hall in Manhattan shows protesters berating the police with a torrent of abuse, suggesting the officers are“getting paid to sit there like f**king idiots.” One man in a skirt even twerked in front of the police before launching a verbal tirade, claiming that hairdressers have to go to school for longer than police do and that cops“can t even read a f**king history book.” Protesters heckled the NYPD officers, including the dancer from above, who called the black officer a traitor to his people and a “fucking black Judas.”pic.twitter.com/uB63nIExrT The beskirted man then directed his abuse at a black officer.“Traitor, traitor to your f**king people! You re like the f**king black Judas! Selling Christ for f**king 33 cents,”he shouted while mincing back and forth before the line of cops. The incident sparked a flood of criticism of the protesters’ actions, with many accusing them of displaying an extraordinary level of arrogance.“Confirms what we already knew. College campuses imbue students with hateful, ahistorical rhetoric and then send them out into the world as smug Marxist clowns,”commentator Erielle Davidsonsaidon Twitter. This is what privilege looks like.⬇️⬇️⬇️“Half of you don’t even have a college education!”https://t.co/7QvfzWJHXP There have been repeated clashes and outbreaks of violence at New York’s so-called ‘City Hall Autonomous Zone’, or CHAZ, in honor of its namesake protest camp in Seattle, which was unceremoniously torn down by police on Wednesday morning. Eyewitness footage from the scene shows that protesters and police alike became increasingly agitated ahead of a New York City Council vote on police financing on Tuesday. The council subsequently voted to cut $1 billion from the NYPD’s $6 billion annual operations budget. Taken nearly at 5:40am this morning at#OccupyCityHallin Manhattan. Even after we obeyed their orders to move to the sidewalk, they continued to push us even further back. We weren’t having it.pic.twitter.com/kvXK3hX8eR Crowd near NYC’s CHAZ chants: “NYPD! Suck my dick!”pic.twitter.com/ZDwwQAE6e4 Opponents and supporters of the vote questioned the authenticity and effectiveness of the move. Some $484 million will be cut directly, including from upcoming training budgets, while $354 million will be shifted to other areas like education and social services. The Co-Chairman of the Council’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, I. Daneek Miller, opposed the cuts, saying it made no sense when crime was rising in the city, not falling. The week-long NYC encampment was established in the last week of June and mirrored other similar protest outposts established across the US in Seattle, Portland and beyond. The New York CHAZ was established amid a backdrop of looting, outbreaks of violence, and a spike in crime including burglaries and murders. There were 38 murders in 28 days in New York City during the peak of the anti-racism protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody, twice the rate recorded during the same period in 2019. So far in 2020 there have been roughly 25 percent more murders in New York City than in the same period last year. Seattle’s CHAZ finally met its end on Wednesday, with police arresting those who refused to leave, but scenes in recent days suggest that New York City’s CHAZ is just getting started.

"1 Jul, 2020",Pole position for virtue-signalling: Mercedes all-black cars show sport is locked in gimmicky race to prove who cares more,"The announcement by Formula One team Mercedes that their cars will be clad in black livery this season is the latest sign that sport is locked in a vacuous, virtue-signaling race to the bottom. In what reeked of a move to placate their star man Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes this week announced that for the 2020 season their cars would depart from their traditional silver arrow colors in favor of a predominantly black design in honor of the blacklivesmatter movement. ""The blacklivesmatter movement has shone a searching light on how much we need new measures and actions in the fight against racism and all forms of discrimination,""said a statement from the team, appearing to believe that adding a new coat of paint to their cars would somehow help combat the lack of diversity which six-time world champion Hamilton has argued is rife within motorsport. A black star in a white-dominated sport, Hamilton has been F1 s most vocal critic during the latest wave of blacklivesmatter unrest,shaming teams and fellow driverswith claims that their silence effectively equates to complicity in sustaining inequality. With Mercedes gesture – which has been accompanied by a pledge to bring in a more diverse range of talent throughout the team – it seems they have at least bought some time with their main man Hamilton, also picking up a few virtue-signaling bonus points along the way. But one suspects that putting Hamilton onto the podium in his new all-black car will be the straightforward part for Mercedes when the season belatedly begins in Austria this weekend; much, much harder will be following through on their diversity pledge, especially as the team s own research indicates that just 3 percent of their workforce belong to ethnic minority groups. In light of those figures, superficial car changes in a sport which loves nothing more than tinkering with designs and engineering seem very much like the easy option. But Mercedes are far from the only ones engaging in increasingly populist but ultimately superficial displays of caring about causes such as the blacklivesmatter movement. Football is another prime example. When the English Premier League recently returned from its coronavirus hiatus, it was no longer enough for players to celebrate a goal by taking a knee or flash an undershirt with a supportive message. Instead, each and every player and match official dropped to their knees in a show of solidarity after the referee blew his whistle to start matches, and each and every player had blacklivesmatter printed across the back of their shirts where their names would ordinarily be. There were similar scenes whenUS women s soccer players took a knee at the weekend, with only a handful risking opprobrium by daring to stand for the playing of the anthem. The NBA, meanwhile, plans to paint blacklivesmatter across courts when it finally emerges from its Covid-19 shutdown at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando at the end of July. There are numerous other examples as sports around the world fall over themselves en masse to prove just how much they care about a movement which, if they answered honestly, many athletes will give little thought to once the current protest bandwagon has moved on. The argument will be, of course, that shows of solidarity can do no harm, that those involved in them are well-meaning, and that any gesture which helps raise awareness is a good thing. True, only the most obnoxious of observers would argue against authentic attempts to stamp out racism. Also true is that when taken selectively and with a genuine grievance to bear, sporting protests can be a powerful, moving force. We ve seen numerous examples of that down the years, and there are athletes around the world of all colors and creeds who genuinely care about the anti-racism cause. But the danger now – as with Mercedes – is that we are straying into increasingly flashy and gimmicky displays of so-called caring which risk making a mockery of the underlying message. A comparison which readily comes to mind is Remembrance Day in the UK and Commonwealth, marked each November 11 in honor of members of the armed forces who have died in the line of duty. Typically symbolized by the wearing of a poppy, in recent years the surrounding commemorations have become ever-more cringeworthy and, in cases such as a human poppy mascot taking to the pitch in one football match, openly laughable. “Yeah, don’t worry it’ll be tasteful”pic.twitter.com/DVmowRNuYx Displays such as this only serve to incite cynicism, eye-rolling and ridicule, and it s not a stretch of the imagination to see this is where we are heading with sport s anti-racism protests. When sport is awash with gimmicks, the underlying issues risk getting drowned. People pat themselves on the back for superficial gestures of support when in reality sport, as with society, would be better off without sporadic, superficial shows which change little, and should instead get their head down and solve the deeper, more complex issues. So painting it black might be an eye-catching step from Mercedes, but a promise to boost the diversity of their workforce will be a much tougher test of their professed commitment to the anti-racism cause. We await to see if they get off the starting grid with that particular pledge. By Liam Tyler RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved.

"29 Jun, 2020",V-shaped recovery of financial markets is a myth: They will be destroyed by a credit default tsunami,"The commercial and residential property markets are on the brink of collapse. And central banks’ promise to print unlimited amounts of money will not solve the problem, but trigger a major financial crisis. Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi Mitchell Feierstein is the CEO of Glacier Environmental Fund and author of ‘Planet Ponzi: How the World Got into This Mess, What Happens Next, and How to Protect Yourself.’ He spends his time between London and Manhattan. Join Mitch on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook –@Planetponzi In New York on Tuesday, June 23, at around 13:45, the NASDAQ Composite Index traded at a new record high of 10,221.85. While US economic data indicates the nation is in the most severe depression in its history, the NASDAQ has surged an unprecedented 39 percent since Wednesday, April 1. Are the current ‘V-shaped recovery’ price actions and stratospheric valuations of the NASDAQ justified or has reckless Federal Reserve money-printing permanently inflated wild asset bubbles in the stock, bond, property and credit markets? Will these prices, manipulated by the extraordinary interventions of global central banks, create the most significant global financial crisis in history? Stock market bubbles have nothing to do with prosperity on Main Street. History is necessary. It provides us with a perspective on what data points would be required to achieve the V-shaped recovery we have witnessed in the NASDAQ from April Fool’s Day to last Tuesday. Consumer spending is a critical engine that drives economic growth in every economy. Accordingly, to have a substantial and sustainable economic recovery, the economy needs to be close to full employment. Is that where the US is now? Not even close. Around 50 million Americans are unemployed, and in the first quarter of 2020, the US gross domestic product contracted by 5 percent. The percentage of full-time employees relative to the working-age population is below 45 percent, the lowest in recorded history. This current negative feedback loop between employment and consumption is not sustainable. The central banks have provided endless liquidity to the markets, which have seen enormous share buybacks, enabling momentum chasers to buy every dip and CEOs to profit handsomely – cannibalizing their corporation’s balance sheets at taxpayer expense, just like American Airlines CEO Doug Parkerdid.Stocks have ignored gravity, aka economic reality. In the words of the day trading community, “Stocks can only go up, right?” One great example of central bank manipulation is Apple. Its shares traded at a new record last week of $372.78, seeing the tech giant’s market capitalization rocket towards 2 trillion dollars. The buyers of Apple shares must be thinking the 50 million debt-saturated, unemployed Americans are desperate to purchase a new $1,700 iPhone or a $4,500 MacBook Pro. Nope. Central banks, specifically the Swiss National Bank and Federal Reserve, have purchased Apple’s shares and corporate bonds, inflating the ‘Apple bubble’ and funding massive stock buybacks. How does this help Main Street? It does not. It creates an illusion of profitability, widening the wealth gap and enriching the technology oligarchy. During his career at Apple, CEO Tim Cook’s total compensation is over 1 billion dollars. It 2018, it was $136 million and in 2019 dropped to $125 million. It is a safe bet Cook’s total compensation for 2020 will set a new record high, above $150 million a year. An even more ridiculous example of irrational exuberance is the share price of Elon Musk’s Tesla. You know, the company that has three or four press releases a day and doesn’t keep to targets or make profits. Tesla’s shares also hit a record new high last week of $1,027.48, seeing its market capitalization surge to $190 billion. Musk’s profitless company paid him a billion-dollar bonus this quarter. Still, I guarantee that those who purchased Tesla shares will regret it. Perhaps even as soon as the company’s next capital raise, because profitless corporations, like Tesla, that burn cash faster than a SpaceX rocket burns fuel, always need more funding. It’s similar to heroin junkies always needing the “next quick fix.” I can say that Elon Musk is one hell of a salesman – he likely put the “s” in snake oil. Meanwhile, central banks have promised to print unlimited amounts of money, but they will never be able to print demand, and fail to recognise the difference between provision of liquidity and remedying basic issues of solvency. Covid-19 has seen workforces across the globe collapse, and those Americans finding themselves among the employed 45 percent are lucky. They are allowed to work from the “safety” of their own homes. Covid-19 has crushed corporate profits and made management realize how it may be more profitable to have employees work from home rather than report to an office every day. Think about the savings: corporations can cut employees and rent payments. The 1,000-pound gorilla in the room no one sees or will acknowledge is the commercial and residential real estate markets. I know of many highly leveraged commercial property developers with massive loans that are either close to or already in default, with no prospect for tenants anywhere in sight. This includes shops on every high street along with the enormous amount of now deserted and vacant strip malls and shopping centers across America. Likewise, with millions of unemployed Americans, the number of residential mortgage defaults is skyrocketing as well. Not only that, but many parts of Manhattan look like hollowed-out war zones, featuring businesses dead, dark and shuttered with plywood boards covered in blacklivesmatter stickers. It is unrecognisable from only a few months ago. In many of the condominium and co-op buildings, commercial tenants are boarded up and have closed permanently. The loss of income revenues generated by these commercial tenants will massively increase the owner’s monthly maintenance charges and instantly devalue the property values by a minimum of 30 percent. The leveraged speculators who purchased these properties to flip or to let have even bigger problems. Firstly, there are no buyers or renters. Secondly, there is far too much supply at astronomical prices. In addition, the laws have been changed so if one purchased and rented out a two-bedroom property for $9,000 per month and the tenant cannot pay the rent, New York prohibits the speculator from evicting the tenant. Good luck servicing the mortgage debt on properties with zero income. How far can Manhattan property prices plummet? Just as real estate prices collapsed in Japan by 90 percent, global property prices can do the same from pre-crime/Covid-19 price levels. Both the commercial and residential property markets are a train wreck in slow motion, and the bubble inflated by reckless Fed policy has popped. Can the Federal Reserve ramp-up moral hazard to new highs by proclaiming: “We are buying all of the commercial and residential property and defaulted mortgages”? Highly unlikely. It already did that in 2008. While the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Bank of England excel at almost unlimited money printing and bailing out bankers while screwing taxpayers, time and time again they seem unable to understand that provision of unlimited capital to poorly managed insolvent corporations now does nothing other than kick the can down the road. Moral hazard – heads I win, tails you lose – is the same as providing unlimited heroin to an addict, except it’s worse. This fiscal profligacy will destroy the global financial markets with a tsunami of credit defaults while also creating the widest and most dangerous wealth inequality in history, which will result in civil unrest and political instability for the next several generations. Bubbles and Ponzi schemes both end the same way – badly. And this one will be no different. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"28 Jun, 2020","Lynching, stoning and burning: The 1919 ‘Red Summer’ race riots that America and Britain want you to forget but which echo today","In 1919, hundreds of people were murdered in race riots across the US and UK. Men, women and children were butchered. So why is it a footnote in history? Because the media and governments don’t want you to know how they reacted. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. Warning: The following article contains images that may be disturbing to some readers Remember when we thought that 2020 was going to be the Year of Coronavirus? Then along came the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, violent unrest and clashes between police, the far right and anti-fascists. Covid-19 is going to have to share top billing. Remember, too, how everyone compared the virus to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918–19? And yet few people compared the protests and violence to another event from that time: “Red Summer”. That’s because these bloody and shameful few months in 1919 aren’t the kind of history that countries want to teach their kids. Red Summer saw hundreds of people killed in a series ofrace riotsacross the US. Most deaths were white-on-black – including people being lynched, stoned to death and burned at the stake – but it was also the first time the black population had resisted the violence, both peacefully and with force. And, while such medieval savagery chills the blood and the levels of cruelty astound a 21st-century sensibility, there are parallels with 2020. So, what fuelled it and why has it been brushed under the carpet of history? The US at the time was a deeply racially divided country led by President Woodrow Wilson – a supporter of the Ku Klux Klan who was against black suffrage and actuallyresegregatedelements of American society. White-led race riots and lynchings were commonplace – from 1889 to 1918, more than 3,000 were lynched, 2,472 of whom were black men and 50 black women. Black people, despite emancipation 57 years earlier, had far fewer rights than white people. But what lit the touchpaper for the bloodshed of 1919, and what made it so significant, was the return of soldiers from World War One. Armed, angry and ready to fight These soldiers, both white and black, were demobilised at a time of already-rising racial tension and economic difficulty. They were trained to fight and, in many cases, were suffering from “shell shock” (nowadays known as PTSD). Violence flared easily. White servicemen jumped on fabricated rumours of white women being assaulted by“Negro fiends”– rumours sensationalised by the press – and went on random sprees of assault and murder. The Washington Post, that famously “liberal” rag, even ran a front-page story organising white servicemen to gather at a certain location so they could attack black people in the cityen masse. The white servicemen had also come home to cities with few available jobs and homes, an economy ravaged by war and a pandemic, and an influx of black workers from the South, due to war-related labour shortages. By 1919, in the first wave of the Great Migration, an estimated 500,000 African Americans had moved to the industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. Between 1910 and 1920, the black population in Chicago grew by 148 per cent and in Philadelphia by 500 per cent. Alongside the economic effects, white people blamed these black migrants for spreading Spanish flu – a foreshadowing, perhaps, of those just waiting to blame a spike in Covid-19 infections on blacklivesmatter rallies. Some black migrants prospered, creating a new black middle class. This both enraged and frightened people used to a “white privilege” that was off the charts compared to today. Black soldiers returned to a different set of ire-inducing issues. Having risked their lives for their country, they came home to discover that their country and its president didn’t see them as complete human beings. At least 13 black veterans were lynched after the war. They weren’t war heroes; they were second-class citizens. But they were also motivated and emboldened. A bloody rampage “Red Summer” - a phrase referring to the bloodshed, coined by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s (NAACP) field secretary, James Weldon Johnson - was a series of violent events. The most serious of these began in April and ended in November. During that time, across dozens of American cities, white mobs, including women and children, rampaged, destroying black properties and churches, and murdering black people. The Ku Klux Klan had a resurgence after decades of slumber, committing 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919. In one of the deadliest events, more than 200 black Americans were massacred in Elaine, Arkansas, after black sharecroppers campaigned for better working conditions. Many of the attacks were focused on thoseblack veterans, who numbered around 380,000 and were seen as a threat to white supremacy and power. Having done their duty, why shouldn’t they be treated the same as everyone else? They had returned battle-hardened and ready to stand up for equal rights and for themselves. This meant that, in some cities, for the first time, black people fought back against the brutality, notably in Chicago and Washington, DC, where riots saw both black and white people killed (albeit still mostly black). In Chicago, 23 black people and 15 white people died after a black teenager, Eugene Williams, drifted on his raft into a whites-only section of Lake Michigan. He drowned when a white man, George Stauber, threw rocks at him, knocking him unconscious. Despite several witnesses, a white police officer refused to arrest Stauber. Black people protested and, reacting to that, white mobs swarmed through the city, shooting at and torching buildings as they went. Still, the police did nothing, so black veterans organised to defend their neighbourhoods. The riots lasted a week and, alongside the 38 deaths, 537 people were injured and an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 lost their homes. Similar riots took place in British cities, too – mainly in ports such as London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff and Hull. Five people were killed – all non-white – as soldiers returned from an even longer war than the Americans endured, to find similar hardship and similarly easy-to-blame minorities, including South Asian, African, Afro-Caribbean, Chinese and Arab sailors. Ignored & forgotten because of shame? And yet few people know about any of this. There is relatively little reference to it in the mainstream or any other media. Nor in any school curriculum. This is probably because the greatest shame was how the press and authorities reacted. In the UK, the British government, still with a huge multi-ethnic empire, intensified its repatriation scheme. It removed colonial citizens to avoid a “black backlash,” offering a resettlement allowance. Between 1919 and 1921, an estimated 3,000 black and Arab seamen and their families were deported this way. In the US, black resistance was politicised. It was leapt on by the federal government and the press as being Marxist and pro-Soviet. This being just two years after the Russian Revolution, black rights movements were labelled “Bolshevik.” Sound familiar? Just about every mainstream newspaper, including other supposedly “liberal” titles, such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, spun the line of black “Bolsheviks.” The Times ran the headline“Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt.” This was in part due to federal briefings to the press. The state was determined to ignore racial inequality and heap the blame on socialists. The attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, reported to Congress on the anarchist and Bolshevik threat, and accused black community leaders of an“ill-governed reaction toward race rioting.” The riots also coincided with the beginning of J. Edgar Hoover’s notorious career. He blamed the Washington riots on“numerous assaults committed by Negroes upon white women,”despite an absence of evidence, and the Elaine massacre on“agitation in a Negro lodge.”He also initiated an investigation of“Negro activities.” While there were most certainly leftist elements at play, the resistance was without question a defensive reaction to years of unpunished violence by white individuals and mobs. There was no grey area in all this, no “very fine people” on both sides. Yet only one major report, by Dr George Haynes, a black civil servant and academic, in October 1919, recognised this,noting lynching as a national problemand connecting it to the riots. He wrote:“Persistence of unpunished lynchings of Negroes fosters lawlessness among white men imbued with the mob spirit and creates a spirit of bitterness among Negroes. In such a state of public mind, a trivial incident can precipitate a riot… Unchecked mob violence creates hatred and intolerance, making impossible free and dispassionate discussion, not only of race problems, but questions on which races and sections differ.” ‘American apartheid’ President Wilson had condemned the violence but refused to take any significant action to stop it. Not only that, but after months in which black people were butchered in the most horrific and sadistic manners imaginable – strung up, stoned and burned alive – the authorities did nothing to improve their lot. No legal protections, no additional rights. Indeed, as Geoff Ward, a professor of African and African American studies at Washington University in St Louis, recentlytold NBC, it made things worse. “That reign of racial terror, where again the exculpatory work of the white press, police, grand juries and others ensured that perpetrators were protected rather than punished, undoubtedly prolonged the period of American apartheid,”he said. The violence continued. More riots occurred, some even bloodier than those of 1919. Nothing changed for black people, but something did change in black people – something that carried through to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and into today. They were now prepared to fight back. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"27 Jun, 2020",Woodrow Wilson faces woke revenge at Princeton University for ‘racism.’ Is Roosevelt next?,"Princeton has decided to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from its public policy school over his segregationist views, in the same way other historical leaders have been targeted during the protests over the death of George Floyd. “Wilson’s racist views and policies make him an inappropriate namesake,”the university’s president, Christopher L Eisgruber, announced in a letter sent to the school community on Saturday. Removing Wilson’s name from Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs had actually been discussed four years ago, though the trustees decided at that time to retain it. It appears that targeting long-dead leaders over views considered questionable by today’s cultural standards has become too much of a trend in 2020 for the school to uphold its previous decision. Wilson, the 28th president of the United States, died in 1924, three years after leaving office. During his lifetime, he supported segregation, and even segregated some federal departments. But he is merely the latest to face the wrath of woke protesters. Historical monuments in cities across the world have been under threat, including those of Ulysses S Grant, who led the Union Army during the American Civil War and thus ended slavery, and former British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill, who played a prominent role in the defeat of Hitler during World War II. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order in response to monuments in the US being torn down and vandalized, promising lengthy prison terms for those who commit such acts. In Britain, the police have taken a proactive rather than a reactive approach – video footage of a blacklivesmatter protest in London on Saturday showed officers guarding a statue of Churchill. Police surround the statue of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as thousands of protesters hit the streets in London in support of#BlackLivesMatterand#BlackTransLivesMatterpic.twitter.com/Df7ijiFFdJ Wilson, Grant and Churchill are unlikely to be the last targets of the protesters, however, despite efforts by law-enforcement officers to protect their city’s civic assets. Given that wartime leaders are under fire, the likes of former president Franklin D Roosevelt could soon garner the attention of the mob.

"27 Jun, 2020", It makes complete sense to me now : Lewis Hamilton says Bernie Ecclestone s comments explain F1 s lack of action against racism,"Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton responded to Bernie Ecclestone s comments about racism, labeling the former F1 owner ""ignorant"" and saying it was no surprise F1 hadn t reacted to improve racial issues during his tenure. Ecclestone had told CNN that,""in lots of cases, Black people are more racist than what white people are."" The comments generated headlines across the world, and sparked a swift response from the current ownership of Formula 1, Liberty Media, with an official statement slamming Ecclestone for his remarks.

In addition, Formula 1 chairman Chase Carey announced Thursday that he had made a personal donation of $1 million towards a foundation to promote and improve diversity in the sport. Hamilton, meanwhile, has been at the forefront of a push to improve racial diversity and inclusion within F1, and has launched his own commission to help engage more people from black backgrounds. He also took part in the recent "" blacklivesmatter "" demonstration in London last weekend. In a post to his Instagram story reacting to Ecclestone s comments, the six-time world champion said,""So sad and disappointing to read these comments. ""Bernie is out of the sport and a different generation but this is exactly what is wrong – ignorant and uneducated comments which show us how far we as a society need to go before real equality can happen. ""It makes complete sense to me now that nothing was said or done to make our sport more diverse or to address the racial abuse I received throughout my career.

"26 Jun, 2020",Why are police across the US piling on the cartoonish violence & racist rhetoric when they know they’re being watched?,"Over-the-top gratuitous violence against unarmed protesters, shockingly racist conversations, all of it somehow recorded for posterity (and maximum virality) – are American police TRYING to get their profession abolished? is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram While police brutality has been an ugly reality for as long as the US has had police, the cartoonish levels of on-camera police violence circulating on social media in the last month are truly mind-boggling. Suddenly, there is no better advertisement for the police-abolition movement than the police themselves. Defenders of the police tend to blame the “few bad apples” who shoot fleeing suspects, choke innocent men, or pepper-spray peaceful demonstrators for cops’ bad reputation. But that absolves from responsibility the supposed “good apples” who have repeatedly closed ranks around those same problem officers, even as their unconscionable assaults are caught on film and broadcast to the world. It would be hard to choreograph a film scene more likely to provoke a backlash against police than the killing of George Floyd. White Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin was filmed kneeling on the handcuffed black man’s neck for an excruciating eight minutes, all but smirking directly into the camera as if he knew it was his big moment of stardom. Ever since, public opinion of the police has been pummeled by a non-stop stream of on-camera brutality, and cries to defund police forces across the country are reaching fever pitch. With so much public outrage against police abuses, one might think that police departments would be hurrying to clean house and get rid of their “bad apples.” Accountability – punishing the truly bad cops in court with prison sentences rather than desk duty or dismissal from the force – would seem to be the only alternative to defunding. Incremental reforms, like the rollout of body cameras and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s move to outlaw chokeholds that were already banned by the NYPD in 1993, are clearly not having the desired effect. But police departments have resoundingly failed to hold their officers accountable, and so – with a handful ofexceptions– have courts. Instead, the violence has only gotten more alarming. It’s worth asking why these officers engage in such disturbing acts of violence, knowing they’ll be on social media and probably the nightly news, providing a glowing advertisement for police abolition. Surely they aren’t all the racist sociopaths blacklivesmatter has, with its “All Cops Are Bastards” slogan, dubbed them? It’s hard in 2020 to find a public place where there isn’t at least one camera on the scene - though that didn’t stop Louisville cops from shutting off their body cameras before local barbecue owner David McAtee was shot, allegedly with a National Guard bullet, earlier this month, an incident that remains under investigation. But cops in the past have gone to great (and possibly illegal)lengthsto stop civilians from filming them in the act of abusing their authority. The man who filmed the 2014 police chokehold killing of Eric Garner even sued New York City two years later over alleged retaliation by the cops, claiming he was arrested on trumped-up charges for documenting the brutal act. Yet 2020 s over-the-top bad cops seem unconcerned with amateur cinematographers. One might expect officers to be on their best behavior post-George Floyd, not auditioning for a spot on the now-cancelled COPS reality show. Even nonviolent policing incidents seem designed to incite popular outrage. The bizarre arrest of a CNN reporter covering the early unrest in Minneapolis – in which sheepish-sounding officers apologetically informed correspondent Omar Jimenez that he was under arrest while live on the air – elicited predictable cries of free speech suppression and a groveling apology from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. And were the three North Carolina cops – referred to as “veteran officers” of the Wilmington Police Department and fired earlier this week after their disturbingly racist chats were recorded via “accidental activation” of a dashboard camera – really unaware those cameras could be inadvertently triggered? Why indulge in multiple in-car hatefests when you know you’re under surveillance? None of this adds up. Even as more communities seem to warm to the notion of “defunding the police,” it remains unclear what will replace them. Are we looking at a future of empoweredcommunity snitches, each snooping on the next in the hope of being rewarded by local government for catching a crime in progress? Or are the rich merely going to hire Blackwater-style mercs to guard their compounds while the poor rob and kill each other in the streets? Americans deserve some answers – preferably before our police departments are dissolved. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC There’s been worry about big tech companies having a specific political bias for many years. Thefiringof James Damore brought major attention to it given how he was let go from his job, and there have been multiple hearings onCapitol Hillon this concern. Republican senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Joshua Hawley of Missouri especially have been keen to point out these issues of bias in those hearings. Independent journalist Tim Pool was featured on the Joe Roganpodcastbringing these issues up directly to the heads of Twitter as well, sadly to no avail. Despite previous concerns and even the possibility of legislation that could affect how these companies run their businesses, it seems there’s little care from the tech giants, who seem to believe they can act as they wish, with impunity. Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, has stated that if a politician gets their video taken down for having – in YouTube’s opinion – indulged in“hate speech,”the mainstream media can reupload it because they provide“context.”I can’t be the only one who thinks that this is backwards. The original clip is the context. I don’t need Don Lemon to shed alligator tears over something for me to understand it. Beyond that, who is it that decides what is and isn’t hate speech? YouTube? In that case, the definition is whatever they want it to be at that exact moment. So if“hate speech”is talking about border security and law enforcement, you’re not going to see much from Conservatives without a spin from CNN or The Young Turks. Twitter also recently suspended the popular pro-Trump memester Carpe Donktum, whose memes have been retweeted by the President before. The ban is also permanent, with the tech giant citing copyrightinfringementin the decision. The problem is that the memes usually shared by Donktum are obviously transformed media, which would fall under fair use protection. Similar tactics have been used on YouTube to silence opinions as well by burying people in copyright claims so that their opinions can be bogged down incomplaintsrather than be seen by the public at large. The game that Big Tech is playing is rather obvious to anyone with a set of eyes. There is a desire by these tech giants to shutter the opinions of people on the right that might sway opinion towards voting for Donald Trump. We live in a time where these big companies have managed to make the public forum into a monetized business, and there have been many positives that have come of it. However, the problem is that there is exactly zero respect for the First Amendment of our constitution. They’re happy to stifle speech they don’t agree with simply because of a different opinion or worldview. However, like thefoolishtactics of blacklivesmatter , these sorts of things don’t go unnoticed. As time has gone on, it’s obvious that these folks don’t understand what the Streisand Effect is. The more they try and sweep these conservative ideas and memes under the rug, the more people are going to want to see them. When people do see these opinions and realize they aren’t“hate speech”or anything of the sort, how do you think they’re going to vote? Here’s a hint. They’re not going to pull the lever for Joe Biden in the fall, that’s for sure. What’s funny about all of this is that American novelist and Daily Wire podcaster Andrew Klavan’s satire of Google’s actions has become areality. Maybe the heads of Big Tech companies should just wear Cobra Commander costumes and be done with it. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

Quick, censor them before it spreads! So says the media establishment, threatened by the continued existence of free speech online. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram One could be forgiven for questioning why the Atlantic would devote a lengthy feature to the internal squabbles of a My Little Pony fansite called Derpibooru, which hosts“millions”of fan-drawn artworks celebrating, exploring, and interpreting the wholesome, brightly-colored world of the cartoon ponies. But the piece has vanishingly little to do with an escapist paradise in which“Friendship is Magic”– the official name of the series, and the defining ethos of the pony universe – and where we all can, in fact, just get along. Instead, it’s all about censorship – the need for even these supposedly warm and fuzzy“bronies""to constantly police themselves, lest“white supremacy”take root among them. The ""bronies,"" adult fans of the children s TV show ""My Little Pony,"" have tacitly allowed white supremacists into their ranks for years. But following blacklivesmatter protests, they re finally waking up,@kait_tiffanyreports:https://t.co/V0mvSbmxYx Derpibooru, it turns out, was founded with an anti-censorship ethos. Users were discouraged from complaining about content, instead told to use filters to hide material they found offensive. The Atlantic admits the vast majority of the site’s users disdain political art – what good is an escapist paradise if the real world keeps jamming its nose in? In the past few weeks, however, a tiny fraction of users for and against the blacklivesmatter protest have apparently been making political art to express their views and down-voting their ideological opponents’ posts en masse. When a faction of anti- blacklivesmatter users steeped in 4chan’s pointedly-offensive troll-humor posted their own pony-fications of popular“white nationalist”memes, the pro- blacklivesmatter broniesreportedly struck back, convincing Derpibooru’s owners to not only tweet a statement in support of blacklivesmatter but also to scrap the board’s no-censorship rule. Now that the censors have gotten an inch, of course, they want a mile. “They banned uploading images that were created for no reason other than to incite controversy, and removed images making fun of the protests. They did not ban expressions of racism,”the Atlantic sniffed, echoing the concerns of users posting on social mediabeggingthe moderators to“remove all the racist s**”nowor“purge all of that racist bulls** imagery that people post on there.”So ends another experiment in free speech on the internet – not with a bang, but with a whinny. Racism is obviously repugnant, and one can argue it has no place on a My Little Pony message board, but it’s important to keep the problem in perspective. Out of millions of uploaded artworks, the Atlantic claimed Derpibooru had 900 tagged as“racist,”less than a tenth of one percent. On top of that, making art that explores a controversial political viewpoint doesn’t necessarily equate to supporting that political viewpoint. The Atlantic says the brony fandom is full of racists and claims there are over 900 images taged ""racist"" on the brony art site Derpibooru.First of all, that s not true.Second, even if it were, 900 is minuscule compared to the most popular tags.https://t.co/v9NccNYUEXpic.twitter.com/N7eSESESt4 The Atlantic may marvel at the bronies’“totally nonsensical hodgepodge of values,”clutching its pearls at the notion that forum users could simultaneously admire“Aryanne, a fan-invented Nazi pony with a pink swastika on her hip”and appreciate the blacklivesmatter -themed art, but expecting devotees of cartoon ponies to march in lockstep with any political ideology is ridiculous. Romanian artist Linda Barasz, perhaps the first to slap a swastika on a My Little Pony over a decade ago, became a star in the art world for the controversial piece. But the world has changed a lot since then (including, apparently, the definition of racism. That bronies have become such a cultural phenomenon at all can arguably be traced to that strain of militant political correctness that told a generation of men it wasn’t their actions but“toxic masculinity”itself that was oppressive to women. These men grew up being told that their mere existence constituted a form of assault on womankind unless they constantly negated what they were told was unconscious misogyny and were praised for“calling out”men who did not broadcast a healthy shame at being born male. Many who populate brony forums and other fantasy fandoms – or 4chan, for that matter – have opted to give the dating pool and sexuality itselfa wide berth, reasoning it’s better to escape into their preferred alternate universe than risk being crucified for violating one of the many unspoken rules of the 21st-century sexual minefield. Similarly, in 2020, it is no longer enough to simply not be a racist. The definition of the term has expanded to include all white people who are not constantly and consciously engaged in“working on”the“systemic racism”that they are told infects every aspect of western society. White people are expected to debase themselves – to literally get on their knees and apologize, or polish the shoes of black people (who, it must be said, didn’t ask for this either) to compensate for centuries of oppression. Better yet, they should hunt down and expose“racists”– using the new, expanded definition. Only then are they fit to call themselves allies. Intentionally or not, this approach marginalizes a large swath of people – especially white people, especially men. The Atlantic quotes a media studies professor marveling that bronies take pride in“the idea that they can make the mainstream uncomfortable.”But how many of these people were rejected by a society whose values categorically excluded them before they made the conscious choice to reject that society’s values? When only so-called“extremists”will unconditionally accept a large segment of western society for who they are, the problem is not with the extremists, but with a mainstream as intolerant as the bigots it claims to see under every rock. It’s easy to mock the trials and tribulations of the bronies, forced to undergo a political reckoning they neither wanted nor, to be fair, needed; indeed, that’s the aim of much of the media coverage of groups like them. But this thought-policing ethos – jamming an ultra-rigid form of political correctness into spaces that have become safe havens from it – is never satisfied with anything short of total control. Before you laugh at the grown men drawing pictures of pretty ponies, remember: first, they came for the bronies. Next, they could come for you.

"24 Jun, 2020","Renaming America: From Rhode Island-sans-Plantations to Obamaland, here’s how your home state could soon be redubbed","In the rush to erase America s problematic past, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo will drop the word ‘Plantations’ from the state’s full name. But why stop there? Why not give the entire US a rainbow-colored woke-over? Raimondo, a Democrat, signed an executive order on Monday to drop the word ‘Plantations’ from ‘Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,’ the official name of the smallest US state. ""We can t ignore the image conjured by the word plantation ,""she told a cheering crowd in the city of Providence.“We can t ignore how painful that is for Black Rhode Islanders to see that and have to see that as part of their state s name."" Our work to dismantle systemic racism in Rhode Island did not start today and it will not end today, but we can rise together and make meaningful progress toward racial equity now.https://t.co/D0nvtC1g8Xpic.twitter.com/6iE1zwMTBL The name was coined in the 17th Century by theologian Robert Williams, an abolitionist. Although Rhode Island would go on to become a hub of the slave trade, the term ‘plantation’ at the time simply meant a settlement, and not a farm worked by slaves. However, multiple attempts had been made before to drop it from the state’s full name. When put to voters in 2010, the effort failed dismally. Times are different now, however, and in the wake of George Floyd’s death, statues referencing the country s troubled past are coming down across the US. In the spirit of progress, reform, and social justice, why stop at Rhode Island? Here are five states overdue a progressive update. The home of logging, rain, and Kurt Cobain, Washington State is considered by many a dreary place. However, Seattle is a liberal lodestar and social justice-minded secessionists across the country have looked to its ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone’ for inspiration, with protesters in Washington, DC attempting to carve out a similar enclave on the streets surrounding the White House last week. The state’s dreariness, its citizens’love for veganism, and its role in exporting left-wing revolution beyond its borders leave us with an obvious choice: The Soyviet Union. Georgia is named in honor of England’s King George II. However, the decidedly un-woke George waged wars of aggression across Europe, and expanded Britain’s colonial interests abroad. In the spirit of progressivism, I propose we rename The Peach State in honor of a more rainbow-colored Georgian, like esteemed Atlanta drag queen RuPaul. LGBT is in vogue, and Republican majority or not, the Supreme Court has shown it’ll back all thingsgay and transgender. RuPaul himself (or herself, depending on his mood), can write a thumping gay bar-friendly anthem, and the state’s motto of“Wisdom, Justice, Moderation,”can be updated to Ru’s trademark“If you can’t love yo’self, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?” Those who disagree with the renaming will be forced to watch all 12 seasons of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ back to back. There will be no dissent. A state whose name means“land of Indians”is far too politically incorrect to stay as it is, and thus the Hoosier State is next on the chopping block. Depictions of Native Americans are a political minefield though, as evidenced by butter company ‘Land O’Lakes’ purging the depiction of a Native American girl in traditional garb from their packaging earlier this year. That’s why 1/1024 Native Americana will be named after the most sanitized representative of the tribe: Senator Elizabeth Warren. Warren has loudly touted her Native heritage throughout her political career, even though a disastrousDNA testrevealed her to have only 0.097 percent Indian blood. Warren, a committed progressive, would be the ideal face for 1/1024 Native Americana, as apart from a single drop of Native blood a couple of centuries ago, she’s as white as the driven snow, and therefore won’t cause too much stress for middle American voters. Warren will be relocated from Massachusetts to the newly-named state as soon as the smoke signals reach her. Named for Queen Elizabeth, the ‘Virgin Queen’ of Tudor England, Virginia in its present incarnation honors a woman who slaughtered the Irish, executed Catholics, and sponsored thelootingof the Caribbean. As such, isn’t it high time to wipe her name from the great commonwealth? The north half of the state can be turned over to the defense sector and CIA, who employ nearly a million people combined there. The state’s coast can then be given over to Governor Ralph Northam to entertain the masses with boardwalk minstrel shows. With Democratic voters clearly okay with Northam’s use ofblackface, this much-maligned art evidently has a place in progressive America, and Northam is just the man to keep it alive. And if that fails to win over progressives, his support forfull-birth abortionssurely will. It has been said that Illinois derives its name from the Algonquian term for“the best men”as rendered in French. This may have been debunked as fake news (the alternative translation being“one who speaks the regular way”), but no one cared about actual etymology in Rhode Island, so why should the Illinoisans? Whether a blatant allusion to patriarchy or praise of ableist supremacy, it has no place in modern America. One solution would be to simply rename it for“the women,”but that would exclude the transgender and non-binary, and deporting these citizens to RuPaul s Drag State would be too costly. Progressive policies have, by and large, failed Illinois. Gun control hasn’t stopped the weekly murderfests in Chicago, Governor Jay Pritzker’s progressive wealth tax plan looks set todrive wealthout of the state, and the state’s credit rating isin the toilet. However, Illinois did give the US Barack Obama, whose presidency the anti-Trump #Resistance so often pines for. So why not honor the former commander-in-chief by renaming the state after him? In Obamaland, progressives can pretend that it’s still 2008, that the country isn’t consumed with race riots, and that the Trump presidency never happened. After all, theydo this anyway, so Obamaland would provide them a safe space to live out the rest of their lives under the watchful eyes of Barry O (and his enormous surveillance infrastructure, obviously). An alternate and obviously crazy idea would simply be to accept that our heroes of the past weren’t perfect; that the entirety of human history is stained by war and conflict, and tearing down relics of the past won’t stop us repeating its mistakes. They remind us that bad people did good things, and vice versa. The best and worst of human nature and capability is captured in these histories and works of art, and erasing them is anti-educational, not to mention anti-reality. But that’s an extremist position in 2020, so let’s welcome The Soyviet Union and RuPaul’s Drag State to the union instead. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"23 Jun, 2020",‘How is this legal?’ Oregon county exempts ‘people of color’ from mandatory face mask rule,"Oregon’s Lincoln County has created an exception for non-white residents in a new compulsory face mask order, citing concerns over racial profiling, but puzzled observers have deemed the move discriminatory, if not illegal. The county’s public healthdirectivemandates that“all individuals”in Lincoln“shall wear face coverings”in all public settings, including outdoor areas where proper social distancing is impossible. However, in addition to people with certain disabilities and children under 12 years old, the new order exempts“people of color who have heightened concern about racial profiling and harassment,”creating a clear racial distinction in the rules. The order has prompted an outpouring of criticism and confusion, with netizens baffled that such a blatantly discriminatory policy could pass muster in 2020, some even labeling it outright racist. What the hell is even happening?One rule for white people, another for everyone else? How is this even allowed?https://t.co/msNyfH68nn Example of the horseshoe theory of racism where you might reasonably confuse a supposedly anti-racist policy with a hypothetical pro-racist one.https://t.co/o7rEsDIWgf The legality of the new order also became a hot topic, as many argued the rule would never stand up in a courtroom. “Get arrested, someone!!! This is a lay-up civil rights case,”one netizenurged, while anotherasked“How the hell is this legal?” Ha, I smell a lawsuit in the futurehttps://t.co/fF9vaXu3Vz Time to file a discrimination lawsuit. This OR county needs to be defunded and all the racists named and shamed and canceled.https://t.co/p3ZmbdJ9vh Some critics saw more sinister forces at work, musing that orders mandating face masks – whose effectiveness are still a matter ofdisputeamong experts – are a“power grab,”having more to do with politics than public health. Similar concerns over politicized health advice were raised amid widespread protests inspired by the police killing of George Floyd in late May, in which many public health expertsoutwardly encourageddemonstrations, despite previously warning that all mass gatherings – including protests over Covid-19 lockdown measures – posed significant risk. Further proof that masks are useless and only a sick power grab by the tyrants we’ve given an ounce of power to. Consistently blown away. “Oregon county issues face mask order that exempts non-white people”https://t.co/2JGhKBDhmovia@nypost Just more proof that this isn’t about your health 🤷🏻‍♀️Oregon county issues face mask order that exempts non-white peoplehttps://t.co/MJw40naM5F Many of the same experts have also cautioned that black and Latino communities are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, making Lincoln County’s new face mask exemption all the more confounding. Black people are unaffected by the coronavirus and no longer have to wear masks or take safety precautions. Only white people have to mask up.https://t.co/IUaVlwrRat Is Oregon county WANTING people of color TO get the virus?? Oregon county issues face mask order that exempts non-white peoplehttps://t.co/Z0n7D0tOnO Some activists have raised concerns that face masks do, in fact, put certain communities at risk, however. According to ReNika Moore, director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program, compulsory mask rules put people of color in a“lose-lose situation”with potentially“life-threatening consequences.” “Not wearing a protective bandana goes against CDC recommendations and increases the risk of contracting Covid-19, but wearing one could mean putting their lives at risk of getting shot or killed because of racially-biased targeting,”Moore argued.
