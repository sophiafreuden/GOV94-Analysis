"13 Mar, 2021",‘Respect to him’: Crystal Palace ace Zaha becomes first Premier League star NOT to take a knee after describing it as ‘degrading’,"Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha made good on his vow not to take a knee anymore as he became the first Premier League star to go against the grain since the gesture was introduced. Zaha stood tall while others around him knelt before the kick-off as Palace took on West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday, making the 28-year-old Ivory Coast star the first footballer in England’s top flight to shun the move. 🗣""I will continue to stand tall""Wilfried Zaha becomes first Premier League player to not take a kneepic.twitter.com/1EKG1WMbyl The former Manchester United star initially explained his decision back in February, saying:“I feel like taking a knee is degrading. “Growing up, my parents just let me know that I should just be proud to be black, no matter what, and I just think we should stand tall. “I think the meaning behind the whole thing is becoming something that we just do now. That’s not enough. I’m not going to take the knee.” Players in England adopted the gesture on the resumption of football last June, amid the swell of the blacklivesmatter movement following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in America. blacklivesmatter signs can still be found at Premier League stadiums, although the league itself has since replaced logos bearing the blacklivesmatter name with a ‘No Room for Racism’ message on players’ shirts instead. On Saturday at Selhurst Park, Zaha stood with his hands behind his back and facing forwards while others on the pitch – including officials – dropped to one knee. The act from the forward won widespread praise on social media. “Respectful decision...I understand where he is coming from. Half the players and people do it to fulfill righteousness, you might as well stop,”wroteone fan. “Stop the kneeling. It doesn’t help anything [or] anyone. We need concrete action,”wroteanother. “Respect to him. Taking a knee isn’t going to change anything and it undermines the whole thing,”read another response. Zaha refuses to add his voice by kneeling! Kept his word. He becomes the only one not kneeling before kick-off in EPL.#zaha#CRYWBApic.twitter.com/gvhtriqaQh Respect to him ✊ Taking a knee isn’t going to change anything and it undermines the whole thing Ahead of kick-off, Zaha had released a statement to reiterate the thinking behind the step. ""There is no right or wrong but I feel kneeling just became a part of pre-match routine and at the moment, it doesn t matter whether we kneel or stand. Some of us still continue to receive abuse,”he said. Wilfried Zaha statement.#CPFCpic.twitter.com/kHF6AKd8D9 ""I know there is a lot of work being done behind the scenes at the Premier League and other authorities to make change, and I fully respect that, and everyone involved. I also fully respect my teammates and players at other clubs who continue to take the knee. ""As a society, I feel we should be encouraging better education in schools...and social media companies should be taking stronger action against people who abuse others – not just footballers – online. I now want to focus on football and enjoy playing. ""I will continue to stand tall."" Zaha is far from the only football figure to question the gesture. Players at second-tier Championship clubs Queens Park Rangers, Brentford, Bournemouth and Derby Countyare among thosenot to drop to one knee before games. Speaking to RT Sport in February, former Liverpool and England icon John Barnes said the gesture was ultimately just a token and could not change“systemic racism.” “Taking the knee highlights the problem, and it s been highlighting the problems since the George Floyd situation.That s all,”Barnes said. “…So if people feel that all they can do is highlight it, then take a knee. But if they feel they want to do more and taking a knee is a token gesture – and in many respects it is just a token gesture – if they decide not to do it because they want to do something else, I m fine [with that]. ""I wouldn t be taking a knee. However, I don t say that people shouldn t be taking a knee. But taking a knee does nothing apart from highlight the problem.""

"11 Mar, 2021","LA police was unprepared for George Floyd protest violence ‘not seen in years,’ believed it would be ‘peaceful’, report says","LAPD was poorly trained, demoralized and disorganized during the May-June 2020 riots, and mistakenly believed they would be peaceful instead of featuring violent and organized “disrupters,” according to a new report. Areportcommissioned by the Los Angeles, California city council faults the police for arresting too many people, and not enough violent rioters; using too much nonlethal ammunition, but not stopping the riots fast enough; jailing too many protesters, but not setting up field jails; and assuming“racial justice”protests would be peaceful based on prior experience, and therefore not being “proactive” about the unprecedented and unexpected violence that followed the death of George Floyd. Those are just some of the things that leap out of the report authored by a panel of former police commanders led by attorney Gerald Chaleff, and published Thursday. BREAKING: First after-action report on LAPD s handling of the summer protests and unrest finds poor planning, inadequate training, disregard for rules on mass arrests and crowd control established after past failures to manage protests (w/@AlpertReyes):https://t.co/KLVcCClJwq Floyd died in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 25, 2020. Riots broke out in the Twin Cities the very next day. Protests in downtown Los Angeles on May 27-28 were“marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality,”the report says, but LAPD treated them as isolated incidents rather than“as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across”the US. The violence caught the LAPD off guard, as they“had believed that the good relationships which had been developed with various communities would cause any protests to be peaceful, as they had been in the past.” Hiding among the protesters were“disrupters”who threw dangerous objects at police and targeted them with lasers, the report noted, in a level of violence that“had not been seen at demonstrations in years.”Yet it faults the LAPD leadership for not being“proactive”about containing the groups whose objective was to“create chaos and confrontation with the police,”among other things. The Chaleff report reveals that some groups of looters“appeared to be well coordinated,”using scouts and“convoys of up to ten cars”to target a location, only to move elsewhere when police responded. Other groups that directly targeted police for violence were“dramatically”different from such rioters in the past, more violent and better organized. They threw“bricks and concrete blocks, using firecrackers or explosive devices, and pointing lasers at officers’ eyes.” Another part of the report talks about the“unrelenting”use of lasers in both LA and places“such asPortland,”as well as“containers filled with urine, frozen water bottles, and caustic chemicals such as bleach.”LAPD reported that 106 officers were injured during the riots. “The Department must do everything it can to provide for officer safety and at the same time protect the safety of those who are peacefully protesting,”the report said, without specifying as to how. LAPD did not establish a command post until May 30 and the first field jail until June 2. More than 4,000 people were arrested between May 29 and June 2 – many of whom have sued the city claiming that under municipal code, they should have only been issued a citation and released. There was also“chaos of command”as officers often received conflicting orders from their superiors. Chaleff and his team found that LAPD had lost nearly half of its senior command staff between 2018 and 2020, leaving it without leadership skilled in“public order policing,”as riot control is now called. The rank and file were also not properly trained in riot control techniques, including the“problematic”deployment of 40mm riot guns, as the dynamics of their use“dramatically change in a crowd control situation when the person engaging in the criminal behavior is not standing still.” The report cited a survey by the Los Angeles Police Protective League showing the department’s morale is close to rock bottom. More than 99 percent of officers do not feel supported by the mayor or the city council, while 86.33 percent do not feel supported by the LAPD leadership. The report made 67 recommendations to the city council,  but the chief among them was to create a high-level position of a“Strategic Emergency Manager”within the LAPD. This displeased blacklivesmatter activists, however, who called it undue criminalization of peaceful protests. What the report“doesn’t do is really critique the notion that LAPD should be putting down righteous protests in the first place,”Melina Abdullah, co-founder of blacklivesmatter -LA, told the Los Angeles Times.

"7 Mar, 2021",New York Times mocked for attempting to downplay 2020 blacklivesmatter protest violence as ‘misinformation’,"The New York Times has been lambasted online for bizarrely claiming that violence surrounding blacklivesmatter protests in 2020 was merely “misinformation” and likening it to Deep State conspiracy theories. The Gray Lady’s Jennifer Medina sought to unravel the mystery behind Latinos in the US voting Republican, in a Fridayarticletitled:“A Vexing Question for Democrats: What Drives Latino Men to Republicans?” Medina teased out the motivations of Latino Republicans through a series of interviews, before attempting to conflate the notion that the “deep state” had taken over the government during the Trump administration or that“ blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence,”dismissing both ideas as “misinformation” within the same breath. “Some of the frustrations voiced by Hispanic Republican men are stoked by misinformation, including conspiracy theories claiming that the deep state took over during the Trump administration and a belief that blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence.” Needless to say, the ever-watchful eye of Twitter did not let this claim about widespread violence slide. One Twitter user was blunt in his analysis:“The New York Times is lying.” The New York Times is lying.pic.twitter.com/3w1AP02B1Q Others criticized the ‘paper of record’ for using weasel words to detract from the gravity and scale of the violence witnessed throughout the blacklivesmatter protests across the US in 2020. Has anybody noticed that the lying media slips in the weasel word “widespread” whenever it wants to hand you a bunch of bullshit? Widespread can mean anything, so no matter how much looting and rioting were done by blacklivesmatter , the NYTs will say it wasn’t enough to be “widespread.” According toForbes, between George Floyd’s death at the hands of the Minneapolis police department on May 25 and June 8, 2020, at least 19 people died during the protests. There were many injuries and hospitalizations on both sides of the security barricades throughout the protests and riots which took place across the US in 2020. Six officers werereportedlybadly injured in just one 24-hour period of the Seattle riots in 2020. According to onestudy,“115 people were shot in the neck or head between May 26 and July 27”by police-fired Kinetic Impact Projectiles (KIPs).

"6 Mar, 2021"," blacklivesmatter backfire? US public opinion shifts on George Floyd s death, law & order, as racial divide widens after summer of riots – poll","US public opinion on the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody has shifted since the early days of last year s blacklivesmatter protests, with trust in law enforcement growing after violent unrest in the streets. Just 36 percent of respondents in a USA Today/Ipsospollreleased on Friday described Floyd s death as murder, down from 60 percent last June. The racial divide in how the May 25 tragedy is viewed is startling, with 64 percent of black poll participants and just 28 percent of whites saying Floyd was murdered. The 24-point plunge in public confidence that Floyd was murdered comes to light just three days before Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was shown on video kneeling on Floyd s neck, is scheduled to go to trial on murder and manslaughter charges. The shift came amid a decline in the blacklivesmatter movement s credibility and rising trust of law enforcement, and both of those trends coincided with riots across the nation. Public trust in blacklivesmatter has dropped to 50 percent this month from 60 percent last June, the poll showed. Just 42 percent of white respondents said they trusted blacklivesmatter . Trust in police and local law enforcement swung conversely, rising to 69 percent, including 77 percent of whites and 42 percent of blacks. But while the racial divide is wide, public opinion has shifted against blacklivesmatter among both white and black Americans. According to the poll, trust in blacklivesmatter has dropped 12 percentage points among black people since last June, while trust in the police has jumped 14 points. The percentage of white people who trust blacklivesmatter fell by eight points, while their trust in police rose 12 points. Along the same lines, Americans were about equally divided on the relative importance of protest rights and law and order last June. At the time, 45 percent said ensuring law and order was more important, and 44 percent said the right to protest is more vital. In the latest poll, 49 percent of respondents favored law and order, while 31 percent said protest rights were more important. The racial divide was evident on that question, too, with whites favoring law and order and blacks prioritizing protest rights. One point on which everyone agreed was the deterioration of race relations in the country. Forty percent of respondents said race relations have worsened, while just 13 percent said they have improved. Among blacks, 54 percent said race relations have gotten worse, and only 10 percent saw improvement. Despite the wide variance in opinions on the cause of Floyd s death and support for law enforcement, 60 percent of Americans want to see Chauvin convicted, including 54 percent of white respondents and 76 percent of blacks. That agreement remains despite increasing numbers of Americans believing that Floyd died as a result of police negligence or by accident. Defense lawyers for the officer havearguedthat Floyd died from an overdose of fentanyl and methamphetamine, as well as heart disease. He told officers,“I can t breathe”as they tried to put him in a squad car, which was before he was pinned on the pavement. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Feb, 2021","‘Those protests were dreadful’: UK Home Secretary says she ‘wouldn’t kneel’ for blacklivesmatter , kicking off online slugfest","Britain’s Home Secretary Priti Patel is no fan of the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ movement, and her latest anti- blacklivesmatter declaration, in which she called the demonstrations “dreadful,” has ignited a storm of controversy online. Speaking to London-based radio station LBC on Friday, Patel told host Nick Ferrari that she wouldn’t“take the knee”for the blacklivesmatter movement, as so many professional athletes, entertainers, and evenpoliticiansare wont to do. “No I would not, I would not have at the time either. There are other ways in which people can express their opinions,”Patel said.“Protesting in the way in which people did last summer was not the right way at all.” Nick Ferrari - Would you take the knee, Priti Patel?#PritiPatel- No, I wouldn t have the time.#LBCpic.twitter.com/yCrovWuRJc Beginning in the US after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, blacklivesmatter protests and riots soon spread across the western world last summer. In the UK, protesters in London clashed with police, desecrated statues, and according to a majority of Brits,increased racial tensions. Patel called the demonstrations, which in London saw a mobpeltbottles and stones at police, as“dreadful.”Though her condemnation was unambiguous, it was not the first time she’s lobbed some harsh words at blacklivesmatter . She described the movement’s protests as rife with“hooliganism and thuggery”in October, and told rioters in June that“there is no excuse”for vandalizing Britain’s war memorials. “There are other ways in which those discussions can take place and, also, quite frankly I didn t support that attempt to re-write history,”she added, referring to certain councilspurgingthe names of ‘problematic’ historical figures from their street names.“I felt that that was wrong.” Her refusal to entertain the idea of kneeing for blacklivesmatter earned her praise from the British right. Quite right, Home Secretary! 👍 Whenever anyone trends on this website - Priti Patel today for example - it s because they ve said something manifestly provable, logical and accurate. Completely agree, well said Minister@pritipatelhttps://t.co/srLl5hnSGU However, she also drew scorn from the left, with one commenterdescribingher as“one of the most repulsive individuals ever to hold high office in a British govt.” Sometimes I think when Boris Johnson needs the public to be distracted from his failures he just pushes Priti Patel out the door and says ""Go be yourself!"". The number of times I’ve needed to protect my energy from the ramblings of Priti Patel... wheww! 🙅🏽‍♀️ Weird how people who are told to protest *peacefully* if they want their grievances to be taken seriously by politicians get criticised by Priti Patel for kneeling. Though Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently issued awhispered declarationthat“there’s nothing wrong with being woke,”several of his ministers have pushed back against the liberal orthodoxy that saw blacklivesmatter celebrated across the west over the last year, often to the chagrin of the liberal press. Equalities Minister Liz Trusscalledon the government late last year to abandon its decade-long focus on“fashionable”issues of race, gender and sexual orientation, and focus on fighting poverty and income inequality instead. Days beforehand, the governmentscrappedmandatory“unconscious bias training”for civil servants, with Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez stating that bias training“may not only activate and reinforce unhelpful stereotypes, [it] may provoke negative reactions and actually make people exacerbate their biases.” Think your friends would be interested?

"12 Feb, 2021",Charges DISMISSED against two Buffalo cops for ‘assault’ on 75-year-old protester who broke his skull in fall,"Two Buffalo, New York police officers escaped criminal charges for shoving an elderly man during last year’s George Floyd protests. Their indictment for breaking his skull prompted the resignation of the city’s riot police unit. Second-degree assault charges against officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were dismissed, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn announced on Thursday. They remain on suspension and still face an internal disciplinary investigation, however. NEW: Charges against the two Buffalo Police officers who shoved a protester to the ground have been dismissed. He suffered a fractured skull after he was pushedhttps://t.co/dLH6RxxhjK The Buffalo Police Benevolent Association was“extremely pleased”that a grand jury decided to dismiss the charges, adding that McCabe and Torgalski“were simply following departmental procedures and the directives of their superiors to clear Niagara Square despite working under extremely challenging circumstances,”according to a statement quoted byWGRZ-TV. The two officers werechargedin early June 2020, after a video emerged of them confronting the 75-year-old Martin Gugino and pushing him away. Gugino, a social justice activist well known in the community, struck the pavement with his head and suffered a skull fracture, spending several days in hospital. As video of the incident made rounds on social media, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo denounced their behavior as“wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,”demanding that they be fired. There was tremendous public pressure on the police, in the light of blacklivesmatter protests spreading across the US in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota the week prior. Members of the Buffalo PD’s Emergency Response Team reacted to the charging of their colleagues as well, however. All 57 of them resigned from the unit, while staying on with the department. In an ironic twist, Cuomo’s Covid-19 lockdown prevented the grand jury from convening to investigate the charges for months, and once it was able to meet, Flynn said he had“higher priority cases”to handle. The two officers are""still suspended pending the conclusion of the internal investigation,""according to a city spokesperson. It is unclear whether they will be reinstated or let go.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the prize with hiscounterpart, Le Duc Tho, “for jointly having negotiated a cease fire in Vietnam in 1973.” Kissinger won despite hisrolein the bombings in Cambodia and in the killings in ‘Operation Candor’. President Barack Obama wasawardedthe Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, inspiring him tobombseven countries as he managed to out-Bush G.W. Bush. The former Nobel secretarytoldthe AP news agency in 2015 that in awarding the prize to Obama, “the committee didn t achieve what it had hoped for.” You don’t say? Yet, one of the biggest jaw-droppers may be a current contender, the corporate-fundedMarxistfront group, blacklivesmatter . The nomination must make blacklivesmatter ’s sponsors proud. And how much do corporatesocialistslike blacklivesmatter ? As ofJune 2020, corporate America had pledged blacklivesmatter over $1.678 billion, led by Bank of America and cheap-labor lover Nike. blacklivesmatter was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian lawmaker. NBC Newsreported: “In his nomination letter, Petter Eide, a Socialist Left member of the Storting, Norway s parliament, wrote that he had nominated blacklivesmatter ‘for their struggle against racism and racially motivated violence.’” By now, much has been said about blacklivesmatter ’sviolentroots. Idiscoveredattempts by blacklivesmatter (and its enablers) to disguise its history and ideology. But blacklivesmatter ’s scrubbing of its shady past has been to no avail, since its goals and tactics were on full display in the blacklivesmatter -inspired riots. Protests and riots, including looting and arson,rampagedthrough the US from May to December 2020. The violence that resulted in theaftermathof the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis was the first “multi-state catastrophe event” ever declared for civil disorder by claim-tracking company Property Claim Services, Triple-I has said. iSnatch? Looters break into#AppleStore during#Washingtonriots over#GeorgeFloydkillingMORE:https://t.co/8mVil0f3HIpic.twitter.com/C7WzcqZvTc blacklivesmatter demonstrations have includedcallingfor the murder of police officers: “What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want it? Now!” On August 29, 2015, during a blacklivesmatter marchoutside the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul, a chant rang out: “Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon.” Inspired by blacklivesmatter , at least two police officers were murdered, one at point-blank range. On September 16, 2020, Axiosheadlined: “$1 billion-plus riot damage is most expensive in insurance history.” But noted in the report was the obligatory leftist cover for those who looted and set many cities ablaze. “The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims.” In late August 2020, CNN infamously pushed the “mostly peaceful” mantra while a reporter was standing in front of a burning building in Kenosha, Wisconsin. CNN’s font actuallyread, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.” In May 2020, MSNBC’s correspondentstoodin front of a building on fire in Minneapolis, during a blacklivesmatter riot. Ali Velshi said, ""I want to be clear on how I characterize this. This is a, mostly a protest. It is not, it is not generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started.” Dedication to the elimination of the family unit, chants to murder cops, the death of at least 19 people, and one to two billion dollars in property destruction – all this seems to have escaped the notice of the Norwegian lawmaker. Or maybe it hasn’t. Perhaps this is the all-encompassing goal of “social justice” – to destroy the fabric of the social body in order to “build back better.” And so, should blacklivesmatter win this coveted award, their honor should henceforth be known as the Nobel ‘Mostly Peaceful’ Prize.

"29 Jan, 2021", blacklivesmatter movement nominated for 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian MP,"The blacklivesmatter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian MP Petter Eide, who claims the impact of blacklivesmatter ’s anti-racism rallies has been felt far beyond the US alone. “I find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,”Eide said. blacklivesmatter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice. In his nomination papers, the MP hailed the movement for its ability to“mobilize people from all groups of society,”including in his native Norway, where some 12,000 people attended an Oslo blacklivesmatter rally in June. blacklivesmatter was initially founded in 2013 in response to George Zimmerman being acquitted of the murder of unarmed black US teen Trayvon Martin, who he shot dead in Florida in 2012. The movement gained traction following the killings of other black people, including George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in July last year after officers put him in a chokehold, sparking global blacklivesmatter -led anti-racism protests. Under therulesfor the prestigious gong, any politician serving in any national government or assembly can enter nominations. The deadline to submit nominations is February 1, and the chosen Nobel Laureates will receive their prize at an award ceremony on December 10 in Oslo. The 2020 prize was given to the World Food Programme for its efforts to combat hunger. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"15 Jan, 2021",Feds charge ANARCHIST who appeared on CNN after telling Capitol rioters to ‘burn this s**t down’,"The Utah activist who captured the fatal shooting of a woman by Capitol Police during the unrest on video, and told CNN and ABC about it, also instigated the destruction inside, federal charges against him say. According to theaffidavitseeking his arrest, filed in the federal court in Washington, DC, John Earle Sullivan didn’t just film last Wednesday’s storming of the US Capitol – he actually took part in the violence and egged on the destruction that led to the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt. According to the FBI, anarchist John Sullivan told police officers to stand down in the Speaker s Lobby, then agitated the crowd to attack the doors and windows while he filmed. Moments later Ashley Babbitt was shot and killed.https://t.co/4dsh8ivgka Democrats accused President Donald Trump of inciting an“insurrection”after a crowd of presumably his supporters broke into the Capitol during the joint session of Congress that was meeting to certify Joe Biden as the next US president. Babbitt was among the five people – including two Capitol Police officers – whose deaths were linked to the unrest. “Go! Go! Get this s**t!”Sullivan says in the video he turned over to the FBI, as the crowd is breaking through the door inside the Capitol, according to the affidavit. Babbitt is shot shortly thereafter as she attempts to enter through the breach. At other times he yells“Let’s go. This s**t is ours! F**k yeah,”and“Let’s burn this s**t down.” Hey@jaketapperI got a big scoop for you.pic.twitter.com/XlqMN8jNo5 He told a different story to CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Good Morning America the evening and morning after, presenting himself as a left-wing activist who just came to document the protest. “I can t tell you that I agree with Trump or MAGA supporters,""Sullivan told Salt Lake City’s KSTU-TVlast Friday.“I can tell you I don t.”He did insist that his footage showed Trump supporters storming the Capitol, not Antifa as some claimed. Officially, Sullivan is a“civil rights activist”who runs Insurgence USA, an organization established in June 2020 amid the protests over the death of George Floyd. They say they“want to build local powers to enable the community to intervene in violence enacted by the state and government vigilantes,”rhetoric commonly used by blacklivesmatter and affiliated groups. John Sullivan faced charges here in Utah after organizing protests. His most recent video post on Intsa.https://t.co/hD7A90Cc2s Sullivan organized a June protest in Provo where a person was shot, and was arrested over it. A journalist with Provo’s KUTV news looked at the hashtags Sullivan has used on social media and they included both # blacklivesmatter and #antifa, as well as #abolishthepolice. Later in the summer, he delivered an expletive-laden speech at a protest in Washington, DC threatening to “rip Trump out of the White House,” chanting""It’s time for a revolution”and threatening to“burn this s**t down.” blacklivesmatter inc. threatening to “rip the president out of the White House” They say they won’t wait until the next election.They’re openly calling for a revolution.This is domestic terrorism on full display, out in the open.

OAN reporter Jack Posobiec noted that Sullivan had posted on Instagram about his contacts with the FBI. That doesn’t necessarily mean much, however, given the rush by many Democrats to report Trump supporters to federal authorities in the aftermath of the January 6 events. Anarchist John Sullivan was boasting on Instagram of his contacts with the FBI yesterday. Today they arrested him for rioting.pic.twitter.com/45YkbBWP7r Whoever Sullivan is actually working for may or may not be revealed at his trial. What stands out is the ease with which he was able to garner mainstream media attention and get people of completely opposite political persuasions to follow his lead at various protests.

"7 Jan, 2021","Getting warmer: While insisting Antifa has nothing to do with the Capitol riot, NYT finally admits it is a ‘movement’","After months of fervent denials and rioting, Antifa is no longer being written off as a mere ideology by a US establishment outlet, which graduated them to “a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists.” “There is no evidence that Antifa activists stormed the Capitol,” the New York Times affirmed on Wednesday, blaming “the far right” for making “untrue claims that antifascist activists infiltrated protests.” There is no evidence that the antifa movement — a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists — stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.https://t.co/YD3PlqDlGIpic.twitter.com/Gru5XbBtP5 While some on the ground would beg to differ, the fact that the New York Times is even referring to Antifa as a semi-organized group is a divergence from its previous coverage, which described it as “a movement or ideology” rather than a real organization. The outlet even argued it was “impossible” to know how many members of Antifa existed due to its cell-like organizational structure. The NYT was attempting to “debunk” a longstanding claim that Antifa followers were dressing up as Trump supporters and committing wanton acts of violence in order to make conservatives look bad — in this case at the Capitol riots on Wednesday, which turned bloody and left four people dead including a woman shot by police. However, conservative provocateur (and sometime Antifa victim) Andy Ngo actually agreed with the outlet for once, arguing the protesters filmed swarming the Capitol did not look to be “antifa people dressed in Trump gear or Trump costumes.” The ‘paper of record’ has regularly come down on the side of Antifa in the past, noting that “supporters” (if not members) viewed the street violence that has become a hallmark of the group as merely in service to a greater good. Right-wing ideas, the group supposedly believes, must not be presented to the general public, lest an unaffiliated individual fall in line with the “targeting of marginalized people.” The paper admitted doxxing and violent confrontation were part and parcel of the Antifa ‘ideology,’ while arguing in favor of such ‘preemptive strikes’ against the so-called alt-right. Even FBI director Christopher Wray paid lip service to the notion that Antifa was not an organized group in September, attempting to please both President Donald Trump and his detractors by agreeing that while there was no such thing as an Antifa member, the group’s supposed ideology was a “real thing” and that “violent anarchists” might “self-identify” with Antifa. As recently as September, the NYT was still claiming Antifa was “not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.” Instead, it was “a loose movement of activists whose followers share some philosophies and tactics.” Any claims of Antifa members fighting alongside blacklivesmatter were declared delusional conspiracy theories fueled by an ‘irresponsible’ president. Trump has long sought to have Antifa labeled as a terrorist organization, particularly as violence raged in cities across the nation in the wake of the death of black Minneapolis man George Floyd at the hands of the police. Former attorney general William Barr claimed back in June that his Justice Department had evidence Antifa and its ideological allies had been “involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity” that followed Floyd’s death. However, even Barr insisted Antifa was “a very loosely organized group,” even while acknowledging there was “clearly some high degree of organization” within and what appeared to be serious funding.

"28 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: America’s politicians had a busy 2020 virtue-signaling. Here are the top 10,"Amid the pandemic lockdowns, riots and a very controversial election, America’s politicians raced to out-woke each other. From the obscure to the obvious, all listed here pledge allegiance to the flag…of critical social justice. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Here they are, starting on the local level and going all the way up to the top. Minneapolis, Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey simply must be mentioned in any review of performative wokeness in 2020. After the death of George Floyd – an African-American man whose death during a botched arrest was attributed to an officer kneeling on him, rather than Covid-19 or fentanyl present in his system – rioters set a police station and the surrounding block on fire. From there, the riots spread to the neighboring St. Paul and then across America. Frey’s reaction was totake a kneeand wail like a professional mourner at Floyd’s funeral, as if he were best friends with the man. He also tried to join the“protesters”two days later and declare his devotion to social justice, only to bechased offby demonstrators calling on him to resign. He hasn’t been heard from much since. Yet the 13-member city council apparently decided to outdo Frey in public displays of wokeness. Composed of twelve Democrats and one Green, the council first voted to“defund the police”– outright replace the Minneapolis PD with a“reimagined public safety”agency. Except three of them thenhiredprivate security – at taxpayer expense of $4,500 a day – for themselves, saying they had received threats. City council chair Lisa Bender famouslytoldCNN that being able to call the police when your home is being invaded“comes from a place of privilege,”in one of the stupidest statements of 2020. Since then, the council has voted to spend anextra$500,000 to hire new police officers, only to slash the police budget by$8 million– in the name of ‘racial justice’ and ‘equity’ of course. They did so while lamenting the537-percentincrease in carjackings and a 17-percent spike in violent crime in general, as if that was entirely unrelated. For three weeks in June, blacklivesmatter activists and Antifa occupied several blocks of downtown Seattle, declaring it a Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), also known as Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). MayorJenny Durkan, a Democrat, initially insisted it was“not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection”but“a peaceful expression of our community s collective grief and their desire to build a better world.” “We could have the summer of love,”she told CNN. When criticized by President Donald Trump, she shot back:“Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.” Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.https://t.co/o26PkJnYhA CHAZ protesters, meanwhile,stormedCity Hall and demanded Durkan’s resignation. Eventually, they even showed up outside her house – whose location had been kept secret since Durkan’s days as a federal prosecutor. Only then did Mayor Jenny decide that maybe CHAZ wasn’t a summer of love and democracy, and moved to dismantle the shantytown. As it turns out, the CHAZ-ites had an ally inside the citadel all along: Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a self-avowed socialist, whom Mayor Durkanaccusedof opening City Hall to the protesters and organizing the demonstration outside her residence. Sawant actually admitted she“marched, rallied, and organized”with the local community in the name of racial, environmental and economic justice, and accused Durkan of having“utterly failed working people and communities of color in this city.” The city council sided with Sawant,rejectingDurkan’s request to investigate her actions and saying there were more pressing issues demanding their attention, such as“a civil rights movement demanding we divest from racist, anti-Black systems.”To exactly no one’s surprise, a second CHAZ sprung up in early December. While much of the media attention was on Minneapolis and Seattle, the supposedly nonexistent Antifa joined with blacklivesmatter in Portland, Oregon to besiege a federal courthouse and immigration buildings. Mayor Ted Wheeler pulled a Frey and joined the“peaceful protests”in July, only to get thesame reception. When Trump sent federal agents to crack down on the riots, Wheeler denounced the move.“No thanks. We don’t need your politics of division and demagoguery,”he said in an open letter posted on Twitter at the end ofAugust, channeling Seattle’s Durkan.“Your offer to repeat that disaster is a cynical attempt to stoke fear and distract us from the real work of our city.” Within days, however, he wasforcedto move from his condo after“peaceful protesters”tried to set the building onfire, along with nearby businesses owned by African-Americans. Give the man credit for his obstinate consistency, however: even after all that, Wheeler remains a supporter of the blacklivesmatter -Antifa brand of wokeness. Several years ago, Democrat mega-donor and globalist financier George Soros decided to pour millions of dollars into local US politics, specifically elections for district attorneys. People who benefited from his largesse signaled their virtue in 2020 by outright refusing to prosecute rioters or even violent criminals, while throwing the book at ordinary people expressing political dissent. In July, DA Diana Becton of Contra Costa County, California actually charged a couple with a“hate crime”for painting over a blacklivesmatter sign. Becton insisted blacklivesmatter is“an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention.” Some black lives apparently don’t matter to Kim Gardner, Becton’s colleague in St. Louis, Missouri. She ordered the release of everyone involved in the George Floyd riots, which resulted in the death of David Dorn – an African-American retired police captain murdered by looters. Meanwhile, she went after Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a couple who waved a rifle and a handgun to scare off a mob of rioters that barged onto their property. California may be dealing with rolling blackouts, unusually devastating wildfires and mass emigration to other states by people seeking a better life, but that hasn’t stopped Governor Gavin Newsom from pledging allegiance to woke values on an almost daily basis. Citing climate change, which he also blamed for the wildfires, in September Newsom signed a ban on all non-electric cars starting in 2035. This promptedEPAAdministrator Andrew Wheeler to write a scathing letter arguing that the ban“begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet...when you can’t even keep the lights on today.” Newsom was undeterred, proceeding to sign another law that would mandate the state’s prisons to house inmates based on their owngender identity, rather than their sex assigned at birth, prohibiting discrimination based on the inmate’s anatomy. The law is part of California’s“march toward equality”and would help“uphold the dignity”of all state residents, Newsom said. Meanwhile, he has turned all of California into a de facto prison through draconian Covid-19 lockdowns – while exempting himself from the same rules. Whencaughtdining out with lobbyists at the fancy French Laundry restaurant, he shrugged it off by saying he“should have modeled better behavior”and carried on, undisturbed. Lest you think the wokeness is endemic to the Left Coast, there was plenty of it on display in the Big Apple this year as well. Mayor De Blasio was quick to jump on the lockdown train, but abruptly reversed course in June and declared that the virus didn’tapplyto blacklivesmatter protests. Then he personally helped paint blacklivesmatter outside the Trump Tower in an act of“liberating”5th Avenue, as heput it. NYPD was then told to look the other way at crime and guard the sign from peoplesplatteringit with paint instead. Meanwhile, he went after New York City’s OrthodoxJews,singlingthem out for coronavirus lockdown enforcement and condemning theirdefiance. In December, de Blasio ordered the arrest of a Staten Island barownerwho refused his arbitrary orders banning indoor dining. Just a few days later, Hizzoner was on TV talking about schools – which are mostly closed again – and openlydeclaredthat“our mission is to redistribute wealth”during a talk about public schools, arguing it was the only way to deal with“structural racism and segregation.” Hirono (D-Hawaii) is so woke that the Constitution and even the English language can’t contain her. Back in 2018, she famouslyarguedthat Supreme Court nominees don’t have a presumption of innocence because“we’re not in a court of law.”This October, during another SCOTUS nomination, she actually managed to change the dictionary. Mere hours after Hirono made the baffling claim that the term“sexual orientation”was“offensive and outdated,”Merriam-Websteralteredtheir entry to reflect Hirono’s assertion. Now that’s woke! While not a politician as such, the world’s largest museum and research institution complex is funded by the US government. It’s unclear when exactly they decided to endorse the language of critical race theory and intersectional social justice, but this year it was finally noticed. In July, at the peak of the George Floyd riots, a number of people found the ‘Whiteness’ page of the ‘Talking About Race’ series on the website of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture (NMAAHC), part of the Smithsonian Institution. It helpfully explained that self-reliance, nuclear family, the scientific method, delaying gratification, ‘Judeo-Christian tradition’, competitiveness and justice based on protecting property and English common law are all“white”things. The presentation was based on a slide show by corporate consultant Judith H Katz, dating back to the 1990s. Furore over the presentation led to its brief removal from the NMAAHC homepage, and an executiveorderby President Donald Trump in September, banning any sensitivity training that“scapegoated or stereotyped”people on the basis of race, sex or other characteristics. Democrats and diversityconsultantshave urged Joe Biden to rescind the order“on day one.” Not Biden the man, who boasted of authoring the 1994 crime bill and praised KKK Exalted Cyclops Robert Byrd at his funeral – but“Joe Biden”the construct, created by the mainstream media and the Democrat narrative managers as the apotheosis of America’s wokeness. Already woke-adjacent for having been Barack Obama’s wingman for eight years, the 78-year-old white guy from Delaware first burnished his credentials by picking Kamala Harris – or“Indian-Afro-Caribbean Woman Of Color”as the labels go – as his presumptive early replacement. Once the media proclaimed him president-elect, he proceeded to announce a cabinet stacked with“historic firsts”that CNNinsistedamounted to“an administration that looks like and reflects the diversity of America.” Among the“firsts”so far are nominations of African-American men to head Treasury, Defense and EPA, a Native American to head Interior, a Latino as head of Health and Human Services, a“Latino and immigrant”two-fer as head of Homeland Security, and a Hispanic“White House Social Secretary”(we kid you not). Then there are“Women of Color”to be the US Trade Representative and chair the Council of Economic Advisers, while Neera Tanden gets to double-dip and be the“first woman of color and first South Asian American”to run the Office of Management and Budget. Lest we forget, ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen is to be the“first woman as Treasury Secretary.” Proving that he is infinitely more woke than Trump, who only had a woman run the CIA and an openly gay man be the acting Director of National Intelligence,“Biden”nominated a woman to the DNI spot, while CNN breathlessly split hairs to inform America that Pete Buttigieg would be the“first out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary approved by the Senate.” Bright woke future, here we come!

"26 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top 10 CORPORATE panderers who plumbed new depths in 2020,"Corporations went headlong into performative wokeness this year, falling over themselves to embody the spirit of diversity and inclusion. They mostly succeeded in alienating customers and bringing down torrents of mockery instead. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram While some companies deliberately set out to become woke standard-bearers, donating conspicuous sums to blacklivesmatter or delivering pompous press releases about their new direction, others were pushed into the PC pit unexpectedly - whether through guilt by association or because a publicity-hungry customer was able to bend the ear of a story-hungry tabloid. Perhaps attempting to distract from the revelation that management knew about the shortcomings in the 737 MAX’s onboard computer that killed hundreds of passengers in two crashes within six months, Boeing was quick to embark on an internal witch hunt as blacklivesmatter took over the sociopolitical discourse this summer, wielding the big stick of cancel culture against its own employees. Communications chief Niel Golightly resigned after just six months with the company over a 33-year-old article he’d written arguing against women serving in the military. While he claimed the piece no longer reflected his views, it was nevertheless“embarrassingly wrong and offensive,”Golightly said - to applause from the CEO, who boasted about the company’s“unrelenting commitment to diversity and inclusion in all itsdimensions.” Boeing’splanesmay still be horrificallyunsafe, but at least doomed passengers can die content that the airplane manufacturer has“zero tolerance for bigotry of any kind.” Not to be outdone by the Americans, top Scandinavian airline SAS let its customers know in February that“nothing is truly Scandinavian.”Releasing a commercial claiming that cultural touchstones from Norway, Sweden and Denmark had actually come from elsewhere and declaring those countries’ residents were “no better than our Viking ancestors” in terms of (metaphorical) pillaging, the company seemed surprised when Scandinavians didn’t take kindly to being told they had no culture of their own. SAS ultimately removed the spot - though not before blaming the backlash on“right-wingers”and“hate groups.” Publishing giant Penguin Random House in partnership with Barnes & Noble planned to celebrate Black History Month in February by changing the races of iconic literary characters for 12 re-released editions of young adult classics - confusing those they were trying to pander to (who asked why thepublisherhadn’t just featured works written by actual black authors) and alienating others with the cheap stunt. At the eleventh hour, the“culturally diverse”book launch wasshelved. Buttermaker Land o’ Lakes quietly removed the illustrated Native American woman“Mia”from its logo in February following a handful of complaints from Native academics and politicians that the demure image was somehow playing into“sexualized depictions of Indigenous women.”But far from getting the plaudits it expected for the woke gesture, the company was deluged with bad reviews by customers who resented its kowtowing to political correctness. The son of the Native artist behind the most recent depictions of“Mia”even penned an op-ed for the Washington Post skewering the brand, noting that Land o’ Lakes in true American fashion had“got[ten] rid of the Indian and kept the land.”Ouch. Following Quaker Foods’ decision to dump its“Aunt Jemima”syrup mascot in June, citing the character’s racist origins in the“mammy”stereotype of black women, other companies whose packaging prominently featured black characters rushed to dispose of them in what some observed was an ironic blow against minority representation. Mars’“Uncle Ben”and the nameless black chef gracing B&G’s Cream of Wheat packages were unceremoniously ushered out the door in Jemima’swake. Indeed, the frenzy to dispose of potentially problematic brand emblems reached such a peak that ConAgra Foods opted to discontinue its Mrs. Butterworth syrup - even though the eponymous Butterworth, represented in the product’s“distinctive motherly-shaped bottle,”was merely intended to“evoke the images of a loving grandmother”and has no race at all. Dessert maker Hansens opted to rename its popular“Eskimo”line of chocolate-covered ice cream pops in July after a Danish politician complained the term“Eskimo”means“eater of raw meat”and“has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders.”They weren’t the first to drop the supposedly offensive term - Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, which had been selling chocolate-covered ice cream“Eskimo Pies”for nearly a century, vowed in June to rename the product and change its marketing campaign, which had featured a little boy dressed in ‘Eskimo’ garb against a snowybackdrop. Hansens was lambasted for bending to political correctness, with tens of thousands of“angry”Facebook reactions to thenews. But competitor Premier, which makes a similar product called“Kaempe Eskimo”(Giant Eskimo), opted to keep its name - and presumably a larger share of the chocolate-covered ice-cream pop market. Corporate groveling reached something of a nadir with UK department store chain Marks & Spencer caving to a single bullying customer upset over the names of the colors it offered for bras. The individual complained M&S was naming darker-colored bra shades less favorably than lighter-colored ones - the dark color was called“tobacco”while lighter colors sported names like“cinnamon”and“fudge.”Initially ignored by M&S, shopper Kusi Kimani went to the UK tabloids, at which point the chain began apologizing profusely and promised to solve this most first-world of first-worldproblems. In a year where small businesses, especially restaurants, are struggling to merely keep their doors open, crowdsourced business-rating platform Yelp opted to empower the worst impulses of petty wokesters with a new“business accused of racist behavior alert.”The feature was quickly embraced by Antifa, which reportedly asked its members to begin reporting“any company that’s hanging blue lives [matter] garbage in their store or anything else that’s anti the [ blacklivesmatter ] movement”in the hope of driving such benighted establishments out of business. The racism-alert feature wasn’t even Yelp’s first foray into performative wokeness for 2020 - that honor goes to its collaboration with“Open to All,”a company that makes virtue-signaling window decals marking an establishment as a bastion of tolerance and diversity-training kits for businesses that can’t afford the tens of thousands of dollars it costs to hire a corporate-credentialed“diversity consultant.” When it comes to instilling woke virtues, the dominant thinking is that you can never start kids too young, and Nickelodeon quickly caught on to the power they wielded regarding control of young children’s worldviews. The cartoon-dominated network ran nearly nine minutes of a black screen flashing“I can’t breathe”in time with the contradictory sound of breathing (with a countdown at the top of the screen, in case anyone wasn’t aware that this was going on for as long as some of the channel’s actual shows). While it’s not clear if they expected their pint-size viewers to be familiar with slain Minneapolis man George Floyd or the amount of time he’d spent under a smirking cop’s knee, they presumably assumed the unusually quiet nine minutes would drive children to ask their parents what had happened to their usual brightly-colored entertainment - at which point the parents would presumably choose between explaining Floyd’s death to their formerly innocent kids or shelling out some kind of donation to woke standard-bearers Color of Change to change the subject. Stock exchange Nasdaq announced last month that companies hoping to remain listed on its authoritative index had better start diversifying their boards of directors, meritocracy bedamned. Submitting a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require companies to include at least one director“who self-identifies as female”and another“who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+,”the exchange raised eyebrows across the financial sector. Nasdaq isn’t the first to prioritize skin-deep diversity over talent or business acumen, either - investment bank Goldman Sachs also declared earlier this year that it would no longer take companies public that didn’t have at least one“diverse”board member, and Credit Suisse recently debuted a new index called“LGBT-350”to encourage investment in companies considered LGBT-friendly places to work. Given the disastrous recession many of the world’s economies have plunged into thanks to government-mandated shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s hard to tell which companies have fallen victim to the longstanding rule of“get woke, go broke.”However, it’s clear many of those with purchasing power are sick of the pandering - and eager to spend their hard-earned cash elsewhere. But with those who set the economic rules - not just Nasdaq, but the entire ESG (environmental, social and governance) financial virtue-signaling apparatus - having embraced the program of all-woke, all the time, it’s not clear if dissatisfied consumers will have any alternatives in the near future. After all, most small businesses are facing certain death at the hands of coronavirus-crazy governments who’d rather“kill ‘em all and let God sort them out”than allow citizens to make their own decisions.

"4 Dec, 2020"," blacklivesmatter gets a lesson in how ‘trained Marxism’ really works, as leader rakes in millions while chapters get nothing","While the blacklivesmatter Global Network, led by ‘trained Marxist’ Patrisse Cullors, embraced the windfall of donations following the George Floyd protests across America, local chapters say they were left holding the bag. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT.

Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic It was through the hard work of“radical black organizers”engaging in a“protracted struggle for our lives against police terrorism”that blacklivesmatter attracted millions of dollars in contributions this year, yet the blacklivesmatter GN only recently invited selected chapters to apply for a $500,000 grant, ten chapters from across the US said in astatementthis week. “This is not the equity and financial accountability we deserve,”they declared. Despite millions being donated to the network, local chapters have lacked support & resources from national leadership. As a result, much of our local community work continues to be erased.#BlackLivesMatter# blacklivesmatter 10pic.twitter.com/JdbJOP53op The Global Network is“not accountable to local communities”and chapters, and due to its lack of support their work“continues to be erased,” blacklivesmatter DC said in a twitter thread. The newly announced blacklivesmatter political action committee (PAC) and Grassroots entities were set up without the chapter approval – or even knowledge.“[All] of these events occurred without democracy,”the chapters said. This state of affairs isn’t exactly new. Between July 2017 and June 2019, the Global Network had spent $4.5 million on consultants, travel and salaries while giving only $328,000 to local chapters, according to theDaily CallerNews Foundation. What’s new is that blacklivesmatter fundraising went stratospheric in May this year, as riots over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota spread across the nation – and evenglobally. blacklivesmatter GN raked in millions using ActBlue, the fundraising platform serving the democraticparty , and while legions of fact-checkers insisted that none of that funding spilled over to the DNC or any campaigns, the Democrats admitted they also had a record fundraising haul paralleling the Floyd riots. As the African-American activists gave the party a piggyback ride yet again, the very least they could have got out of the deal was some cash for their trouble. Not only did the blacklivesmatter chapters not get that, they also bore the brunt of the backlash against rioting, arson, andproperty destructioninflicted by the riots on their own communities. It was a win-win for the self-styled leadership, lose-lose for the actual footsoldiers on the ground. What blacklivesmatter chapters don’t understand is that the system they’ve embraced is working exactly as intended. They may have forgotten, and the mainstream media certainly hates reminding anyone, that Cullors boasted in a 2015interviewthat she and blacklivesmatter GN co-founder Alicia Garza were“trained Marxists.” “We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories. And I think that what we really tried to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk,”Cullors told Jared Ball of The Real News Network. Having been trained in Marxism myself many years ago, in a country that’s no longer around, I recall all too well how in“scientific socialism”everyone is supposed to contribute according to their ability and receive according to their need. What happens in practice, however, is that this incentivizes the needs to grow – and abilities to diminish. That’s even before the people in charge – who already believe they are “more equal than others” by the virtue of that, as George Orwell put it in ‘Animal Farm’ – decide that their needs are near-infinite. And since there’s a finite amount of wealth to be re-distributed, that means the needs of the many must amount to nearly nil. When the two inevitabilities converge… well, you get the picture. Therefore, it is only right and proper that the activists on the ground get nothing while the leaders such as Cullors, or the Democrats piggybacking on the movement, get to laugh all the way to the bank. Complain all you want, but this is part and parcel of the ideology you signed up for. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"4 Dec, 2020",Leader of black-only NFAC militia ‘Grandmaster Jay’ arrested and faces 20 years in prison on federal charges,"John Fitzgerald Johnson, better known as ‘Grandmaster Jay,’ was arrested and charged with pointing a rifle at federal agents and Louisville, Kentucky police during a protest, which could land him in prison for 20 years. Johnson was arrested on Thursday and booked into a Louisville jail on federal charges, NBC affiliateWAVE-TVreported. Independent journalist Ford Fischer posted photos of the charging documents. The final federal charge is for allegedly ""Assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees.""This is a 20-year felony.pic.twitter.com/ANgVu5BL9q The incident allegedly took place on September 4, when Johnson and his NFAC (Not F**king Around Coalition) gathered to protest against the killing of Louisville, Kentucky resident Breonna Taylor in a police raid. While Taylor was fatally shot in March, protests escalated following the May death of George Floyd in Minnesota and the subsequent wave of blacklivesmatter riots across the US. According to the affidavit, Johnson pointed his rifle in the direction of Louisville PD officers – who were apparently federally deputized – looking over the crowd of protesters from the rooftops of nearby buildings. Though heavily armed, the NFAC has not actually committed any acts of violence during the protests it was involved with. On one occasion, at the end of July, a member of the group accidentally shot himself and two colleagues with his own rifle at a Louisville protest. The group showed up in Lafayette, Louisiana in September and marched to chants of“Black Power”to protest against the police shooting of Trayford Pellerin, an African-American man killed the month before. One person was arrested for accidentally discharging a firearm during that protest, but the NFAC told reporters that the person was not part of their organization. Johnson has no prior convictions and reportedly served in the US military in the 1990s. He is a black separatist, who told RT that he wants the US to“give us our own land here, so we can go in, set up our own government and the whole nine yards”during an exclusive interview in June. His long-term goal, however, is“an exodus to Africa, to establish our destiny and build our own nation – and get a seat at the UN like everybody else,”he said. Like this story?

"3 Dec, 2020",Massachusetts set to become first US state to ban use of facial recognition by police,"Massachusetts is a governor’s signature away from forbidding its police from using facial recognition technology. There are no federal laws regulating the tech, which critics say is flawed and biased against communities of color. On Tuesday, the state House and Senate voted in favor of a police reform bill, introduced in the wake of the killing of African-American man George Floyd, and subsequent ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests across the US. It now needs to be signed by Massachusetts governor, Charlie Baker, to become a state law. The reform almost entirely bans the use of biometrical surveillance by law enforcement and public agencies in Massachusetts. There’s only one exception: police will still be able to run facial recognition searches against the state’s driver’s license database. This will only be possible with a warrant, however. Law enforcement will also be obliged to publish transparency reports every year, with data on how many such warrants had been issued. The bill also outlaws chokeholds and rubber bullets, while placing restrictions on tear gas and other crowd-control means in the arsenal of security agencies. However, qualified immunity for the police, which protects serving officers from legal action for misconduct, has been left inplace. The State Police Association of Massachusetts blasted the reform, saying that it“misses the mark.”According to the law enforcers, the initiative only“creates layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and costly commissions staffed by political appointees with no real-world experience in policing and the dangers officers face every day.” Local authorities are forced to act on the use of facial recognition technology on their own, given the lack of any US federal legislation regulating the controversial issue. It has already been banned by Portland, Boston, San Francisco, Oakland in Northern California and some other cities. Massachusetts may see the introduction of the first ever state-wide curbs. The harshest restrictions so far have been introduced in Portland, Oregon, which has seen months of violent clashes sparked by police brutality. The city has barred not only all of its agencies from using facial recognition, but also made it illegal for such tech to be deployed in public spaces by private companies. The facial recognition technology, which in many evokes daunting associations with Big Brother from George Orwell s dystopian novel‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’has long faced criticism for being flawed and for disproportionately misidentifying people from communities of color. “No one should have to fear the government tracking and identifying their face wherever they go, or facing wrongful arrest because of biased, error-prone technology,”Kade Crockford, who heads the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, told TechCrunch, welcoming the vote by the local legislators. Major tech companies have been acknowledging both technical and legal issues regarding facial recognition. In June, IBM announced that it will stop developing the technology altogether, while Amazon vetoed the police from using its biometrical surveillance platform for a year, saying that it wanted to give Congress“enough time to implement appropriate rules.” State laws however, don t stop federal authorities from expanding their own use of facial recognition. The controversial Clearview AI company – which, from among other sources, relied on social media sites to compile its database of billions of images – has already signed contracts with several government agencies. The latest deal was struck with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in August. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"13 Nov, 2020","Bristol statue destruction is ‘CULTURAL EVENT OF THE YEAR’? We are in big trouble, Twitter critics say","The UK media has found a cultural outlet to be praised as a masterpiece – destroying statues. While some agree that defacing a monument in Bristol was the best art expression of the year, others say vandalism is not an option. “Throwing Edward Colston’s statue in the Avon was the cultural event of the year,”art critic Mark Hudson wrote in the Independent on Thursday. Hudson argued that in a year where Britain’s first lockdown closed galleries and theaters and forced audiences to view art and listen to music from their smartphone screens, the toppling of Colston’s statue was a live event, towering above any“internet-based art projects.” Edward Colston was a 17th Century philanthropist and merchant who funded hospitals and schools in his native Bristol. He was also a slave trader, and as ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests went worldwide this summer after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, protesters in Bristol tore his likeness off its plinth and rolled it into the River Avon. Commenters online were outraged at Hudson’s apparent praise for the statue-topplers in Bristol.“If this was a cultural event,”onewrote,“we are in big trouble, culturally.” It was Unforgivable Cultural Vandalism.https://t.co/4XTwj30U9b Barbarians have breached the gates.https://t.co/VVnGRSLvqT Not everyone endorsed a cultural non-profit organization’stweetcomparing the Colston statue case to the atrocities committed by ISIS against Palmyra monuments or by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Still, even those who support the removal of ‘problematic’ statues considered vandalism a step too far. I care not a whit about colston s statue but disapprove of the method. To compare it to the destruction at Palmyra or Bamiyan is just ridiculous ‘Save Our Statues’ activists are not alone in their criticism, though. When Colston’s statue was pulled down, British politician Nigel Farage controversiallycomparedthe blacklivesmatter movement’s actions to the Taliban’s destruction of two-centuries-old statues of Buddha in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, those endorsing Hudson’s point of view say statues should come down amid the fight against injustice – and actually, Colston deserved to have his monument demolished. Toppling icons of slavery and supremacism really triggers racists. It was a good thing. I lived in a neighbouring county & worked in Bristol for over 15 years. Colston s statue was an insult to the city s BAME population. Bristol is a diverse city which has had a multicultural population for over 200 yrs. Colston s statue glorified a murderer. Colston was not the only divisive figure targeted by blacklivesmatter this summer. One day before Colston’s statue came down, protesters in Londondefaceda monument to Winston Churchill, and vandalized – for a questionable reason – a statue of Abraham Lincoln, the US president responsible for abolishing slavery. Throughout the UK, protesters called the statues and monuments of colonialist Cecil Rhodes and biologist Charles Darwin to be slated for removal. London Mayor Sadiq Khan set up acommissionin June to pore over the capital’s statues, buildings and street names to remove those that“reflect a bygone era.” None of these moves were praised as art the way Colston’s removal was. Shortly after the Colston statue’s destruction, activists installed a resin figure of a black woman with a raised fist, which wasremovedby council officials a day later. The woman who inspired the replacement statue, Jen Reid, has been treated to a profile by local news outlet Bristol Live. The news site described the destruction of Colston’s statue as“a momentous day which shook the world,”and Reid added that she“would do it all over again.” Winston Churchill, now a target for the woke mob, would likely have taken a dim view of Reid and the statue-destroyers targeting the UK’s history.“To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years,”he once remarked.“To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.” Like this story?

"13 Nov, 2020",Quality vs quota? Outcry as Mayor Sadiq Khan tells London police that 40% of new hires must be BAME,"London’s top cop has been told that 40 percent of new recruits must be from ethnic minority backgrounds as the city’s government looks to tackle allegations of racism and discrimination. The UK’s biggest police force has accepted plans to introduce a minimum quota for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) recruits. It is anticipated that Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, will unveil the new race action plan on Friday. The move is the result of long negotiations between the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Met police. Khantweeted:“There remains a great deal of work to do to unpick the conscious and unconscious bias and systemic racism that still exists in our public institutions and our society as a whole. Our Action Plan will introduce the biggest policing reforms seen in a generation.” London s police are the best in the world, but we must do more to improve Black Londoners trust and confidence in our police service, and ensure police powers don’t disproportionately impact them. That s why@MetPoliceUKand I are taking action: 1/2pic.twitter.com/9h5XIqwmjJ London’s police force has the most BAME officers in the UK but still underrepresents the vast ethnic minority community in the British capital. Currently, 40 percent of London’s population is BAME, while only 15.4 percent of the Met’s officers are of BAME backgrounds. In 2019, the Met’s head of human resources, Clare Davies, told reporters that“it would take over 100 years to be representative of London.” While some people showed their support for the race action plan, the initiative has been condemned on Twitter.Some slammed Khan’s scheme, with one user questioning whether it is a ‘form of racism’ itself and whether there could be a positive outcome. Isn t this a form of racism itself? Affirmative action of some sorts? Don t need to look further than South Africa to see the outcome of that...@SadiqKhan@BorisJohnson Another user was disappointed not to see employment offered on the basis on merit. Not those with the right skills then. Just the right ethnicity. Something wrong with the met. Some lamented the initiative, claiming that diversity always comes down to quotas and saying“Quality doesn t matter.” Quality doesn’t matter. In the end diversity is all about quotas.https://t.co/MmoXs5OLDw Many were keen to point out that more than 87% of the UK population is white despite a high BAME population in the capital and notably its Eastern districts. Despite the country being approx 80% white?#positivediscriminationhttps://t.co/XDZG9UbyDv Meanwhile, some praised the initiative. Labour Councilor Judith Garfield claimed that other cities should take note. @SadiqKhan’s Action Plan will improve trust in policing and ultimately help to keep Londoners safe.This level of investment in training and community engagement is unmatched - other cities should take notehttps://t.co/xQTJTuem3q Previous attempts to introduce more diversity on the frontline of London’s police force have failed. The Met police saw a considerable drop in the number of BAME candidates applying to join the force and passing its competency-based questionnaire during its 2013 recruitment campaign. The Met police have come under pressure in 2020, a year of protracted civil rights campaigning and mass blacklivesmatter protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of US cops in May. Protests were organized in at least 260 locations around Britain. A number of monuments linked to the UK’s colonial past were also targeted by the blacklivesmatter protesters, and in some places, clashes broke out between protesters and right-wing groups who claimed they wanted to protect the statues. A study by the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), a group that monitors public order policing, identified“excessive use of force and the disproportionate targeting of black protesters,”during blacklivesmatter demonstrations in May and June. London’s police force has frequently been the target of protests and campaigns, with demonstrators accusing officers of racial profiling. Reports show that black people are six times more likely than white people to be stopped by police when driving. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Nov, 2020",British police ‘ignored and even criminalized’ injured blacklivesmatter protestors with ‘institutionally racist’ tactics — report,"The policing of the UK’s blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) protests this summer was “institutionally racist” and officers used “excessive force”, according to a group that monitors public order policing. A study by the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol)publishedon Thursday identified“excessive use of force and the disproportionate targeting of black protesters,”during blacklivesmatter demonstrations in May and June. Protests were organized in at least 260 places around Britain in the wake of the killing of George Floyd who died in police custody in the US state of Minnesota on May 25. Disturbing footage of his arrest showed an officer kneeling on his neck, despite Floyd saying he could not breathe. A number of monuments linked to the UK s colonial past were targeted by the blacklivesmatter protesters, and in some places, clashes broke out between protesters and right-wing groups who claimed they wanted to protect the statues. The 56-page report, ‘Britain is Not Innocent’, drew on evidence from over 100 witnesses, including protesters and legal observers about how police handled the marches, the group said. Among the report’s other key areas of concern is“kettling,”a police tactic where a large number of protestors are enclosed by officers. Thepublicationclaimed that under-18s and vulnerable people were confined in this manner without food and water, with no social distancing or access to toilets.Also highlighted are“far right”counter-protestors who, the report claims, launched“racist attacks”on young people. These targeted young people were then“ignored and even criminalized by police.” “There is a bitter irony in the fact that protests against racism in policing were themselves sites of disproportionate use of force and discriminatory practices,”said the author of the report, Dr Adam Elliott-Cooper. “Policing in Britain still has a serious problem with institutional racism,” Think your friends would be interested?

"29 Oct, 2020", Isn’t it their own right? : Krasnodar players become presumed racists for not taking a knee before game vs Chelsea,"Players from Russian team Krasnodar have predictably faced accusations of racism online after some of them did not take a knee before their 4-0 defeat to Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. Chelsea’s players all took a knee ahead of the game in Russia while four Krasnodar players did the same, but some fans hit out at broadcasters for not drawing attention to those that did not join their teammates in doing so. “Hey BT Sport, why are you cutting away from the Krasnodar players not taking the knee?”one fan fumed.“Keep the camera on them and shame them # blacklivesmatter .” Another added:“Worrying that this wasn t mentioned on air,”while one even responded by claiming that it’s“crazy how open racism still is in so many parts of the world.” Wow. Watching the UEFA champions league game between Chelsea and Krasnodar in Russia and they took a knee for the end racism campaign and more than half of Krasnodar team stood. Just crazy how open racism still is in so many parts of the world. French team Marseille received similar censure after none of their players joined Manchester City in kneeling before the English side’s 3-0 victory in their game on Tuesday. Olympique Marseille players refused to take a knee in tonight s game vs Mancity. Absolutely disgracefullypic.twitter.com/fsBe01CvfH Kneeling in solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement became customary in the Premier League when football resumed in June as part of the widespread protests against racial inequality and police brutality, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin - who has been charged with murder - in May. However, the custom of kneeling before games has not been adopted in France or Russia, and Marseille’s players instead stood together along the center circle. Reports in France have suggested the players wanted to pay respects to Samuel Paty - a teacher who was beheaded in a terrorist attack in Paris last week - with a minute’s silence. UEFA has said players are free to kneel if they chose, or to remain standing. In regards to Krasnodar, several Twitter users came to the defense of the players who stood. “Isn’t it your own right? Doesn’t mean they are racist?”asked one, while another questioned:“Why is this news? Trying to push that they are racist?” “Absolutely ridiculous!”exclaimed a third.“So people don’t have a choice whether to support a cause or not?” Isn’t it your own right ? Doesn’t mean they are racist ? Why is this news? Trying to push that they are racist? Absolutely ridiculous! So people don’t have a choice whether to support a cause or not? In the case of both Krasnodar and Marseille, it was perhaps the incongruous nature of their circumstances that led to the perceptions of racism. They were far from the only sides not to take a knee in the Champions League this week, where the decision to do so appeared to be random. Both sides took the knee before Manchester United’s 5-0 win over RB Leipzig. However, neither side did ahead of Juventus’ 2-0 defeat to Barcelona or Borussia Dortmund’s 2-0 victory against Zenit St. Petersburg, the latter despite vocal blacklivesmatter advocate Jadon Sancho starting for the Bundesliga outfit.

"28 Oct, 2020",Philadelphia imposes citywide curfew after 2 nights of riots over police shooting of knife-wielding black man,"Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has imposed a curfew, starting Wednesday and lasting from 9pm until 6am, after two nights of rioting and large-scale looting that left the city s Port Richmond shopping district a “total loss.” The curfew is being put in place after violent protests spun out of control on Monday and Tuesday following the death of Walter Wallace Jr., whom police shot after he refused to drop his knife during an altercation on Monday afternoon. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf ordered several hundred members of the stateNational Guardto deploy to Philadelphia to help quell the unrest. At least 53 police have been injured in the clashes, many of whom were struck by bricks and rocks, according to local CBS reporter Joe Holden. One officer wasrun overby a large pickup, and 28 police or fire department vehicles were torched or otherwise damaged. BREAKING: Police release numbers on arrests overnight. They also tell us 23 officers were hurt overnight and all are ok. A total of 53 police officers have been injured since Monday’s police-involved shooting of Walter Wallace. No word on injuries to civilians.@CBSPhillypic.twitter.com/s3Y2ar0z7J Nine ATMs were blown up overnight Tuesday alone, which is something of a tradition during Philadelphia riots. About 50 ATMs around the city were bombed during blacklivesmatter protests in early June, and in one of those cases, the would-be thief waskilledin the explosion. This week s unrest marked some of the most out-of-control rioting since blacklivesmatter protests began in the wake of George Floyd s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. Philadelphia police advised residents on Twitter Tuesday evening that a crowd of about1,000 peoplewas looting businesses on Aramingo Avenue and that they should avoid the area. Another warning went out about an hour later, urging residents insevendifferent districts to remain indoors if possible because demonstrations had turned violent. BREAKING: Philadelphia police have completely lost control of the affected rioting region which stretches multiple city blocks Looters have broken into more than 30+ stores and are attacking white people They are also shooting each other. I’ve only witnessed one arrestpic.twitter.com/bHPGAntwST But police denied a media report suggesting that officers had been ordered to stand down and decline to respond to calls for such incidents as burglary and theft. Police said the order was given to“galvanize additional resources to specifically deal with looters and other in-progress crimes.”There have been 172 arrests during the two nights of unrest, including 53 looting suspects on Tuesday, police said. On the contrary, this order was given to galvanize additional resources to SPECIFICALLY deal with looters, and other priority ""in-progress"" crimes. Officers WILL continue to respond to looting, and will continue to make arrests. 53 arrested yesterday - with much more to come Mayor Kenney has tried to appease protesters, tweeting on Tuesday:“Last night, we saw further evidence of the anguish of our black and brown residents who have struggled their entire lives under systemic racism.”He added that he was“resolved to bring true equity to our city”and would be working with an advisory committee to“advance our reform agenda.” My prayers are with the family and friends of Walter Wallace, Jr., and my heart goes out to everyone affected by this loss. We are committed to hearing your concerns, answering your questions, and healing together. Wallace family members have meanwhile spoken out against the violence and theft.“Everybody out there that s looting, they re thieves,”said Anthony Fitzhugh, a cousin of Wallace.“They re opportunists. And they re stealing because they have the opportunity to go and steal. Do not put my cousin s name on that.” Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"12 Oct, 2020",What a turn-off: TV ratings for NBA Finals PLUMMET as social justice campaigning blamed as factor in fans tuning out,"The 2020 NBA Finals have seen an enormous drop in ratings compared with last year, and the league’s vocal support of social justice issues has been suggested as one of the factors behind it. According toTV Line, Sunday’s NBA Final decider between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat – which the former won 106-93 to take the series 4-2 – drew in 5.5 million viewers, but last year’s final game between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors had an audience of18.9 million, signifying a 71 percent decrease in viewership. Game 5 drew in5.7 millionviewers, down almost 70 percent from the18.2 millionwho tuned in to watch the same game last year. There have been suggestions throughout the playoffs that the enormous gulf in viewership compared to last year has partly been due to the NBA’s increasingly vocal response to social justice issues this season. The blacklivesmatter slogan has been displayed on the courts in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with murder. Players were also allowed to display blacklivesmatter and “Equality” messages on their jerseys. In August, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted a game against Orlando Magic after a black man named Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by Wisconsin police. Texas senator Ted Cruz tweeted that news of the NBA’s falling ratings was “not surprising.” He added:“Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals. #GoWokeGoBroke” Not surprising. Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals.#GoWokeGoBrokehttps://t.co/ygIp60EKHi NBA commissioner Adam Silverhas suggestedthe league won’t be as explicit with its social justice messaging next season. He said that while the NBA is“completely committed to standing for social justice and racial equality,”he predicts next year“there’ll be somewhat a return to normalcy, that those messages will largely be left to be delivered off the floor.” However, while the messaging has evidently been off-putting for a section of the NBA fanbase this season, the severe decline in ratings appears to have a number of factors behind it. Veteran NBA coach George Karl certainly had strong views, issuing an X-rated rant over the slump attacking US President Donald Trump. There is talk of bad NBA ratings on TV. There are lots of reasons for that. The Leagues messages on social injustices isn’t one of them. But, fuck Trump!!And now I feel better... PerKWWL.com, an NBA spokeswoman said that health and safety was the primary concern in organizing this year’s Finals, rather than optimizing them for TV ratings. The games have been played behind closed doors in the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida as a result of the pandemic, diminishing the product on display without fans in the stadiums. What’s more, the delay in the season caused by Covid-19 means the Finals have been played in direct competition with the NFL, which would not have been an issue had the season finished in June as normal. The NBA has not been the only sport to suffer such a decline, either. PerYahoo Finance, the audience for the NHL playoffs dropped by 25 percent – including a 61 percent drop for the Stanley Cup finals – overall, while MLB’s playoffs have suffered a 39 percent decline. The NFL’s early viewing figures show a 14 percent decrease in viewership. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"12 Oct, 2020","Portland police declare riot after mob topple Lincoln & Roosevelt statues during ‘Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage’ (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)","Police cleared the streets of central Portland after rioters pulled down the statues of two US presidents and carried out other acts of vandalism in the city, as part of an “Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage” protest. Demonstrators targeted statues of Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln as they marched through downtown Portland on Sunday night. Footage shows a crowd cheering as the statue of Roosevelt mounted on a horse is pulled down. The statue was then covered in orange paint and“stolen land”and“murderer”were painted on the base of the sculpture.

Several arrests were made, according to local media. Portland has seen months of near nightly demonstrations, with many descending into violence. Numerous monuments and statues around the city have been attacked since the unrest began in the city following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. In June, Portland protesters toppled a statue of US president and Founding Father Thomas Jefferson. Protesters also attacked a statue depicting a family of pioneers, and a sculpture of an elk.

"9 Oct, 2020",Yelp’s accusation-based racism warning on restaurants encourages mob thuggery in the name of social justice,"User-generated review directory Yelp has made it easier for cancel-culture enthusiasts to wreak havoc on businesses, rolling out a scarlet letter for companies “accused of racism” that practically cries out to be abused. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram “Review-bombing” has long been a tactic of social-media intimidation on review sites like Yelp – an angry mob (or a competitor) targets a restaurant’s page by claiming they’ve all found dead cockroaches or hair in their food, or insists a store-owner called them nasty names. To Yelp’s credit, it eventually caught on to this practice and began freezing pages experiencing an unusually high amount of traffic with a “Public Attention Alert” warning users some reviews are likely not based on actual customer experiences and preventing new ones from being added. But while the “Public Attention Alert” was an all-purpose freeze, serving to paralyze the pages of businesses both targeted by and accused of racist behavior and other scandals, Yelp has apparently decided that didn’t go far enough in separating the perpetrators from the victims. The new “Business Accused of Racist Behavior Alert” makes it clear that the owner of any page bearing the warning is guilty of the worst offense one can commit in 2020 – never mind the presumption of innocence. In ablog postannouncing the feature on Thursday, Yelp stated it will be including a link to a news article with every “racist behavior alert,” implying the site needs more than just a few upset customers to apply the scarlet letter (actually a scarlet exclamation point). But the credulousness of most mainstream media outlets with regard to racist incidents – despitecountlesshoaxesin recent years – means even the most spurious allegations will likely find a taker somewhere. Social media is full of gullible joiners, people who can be persuaded to flood a business’ Yelp page with hate (ironically in the name of combating hate) by nothing more than an out-of-context photo and an emotional story. Armed with that rise in review activity and a news article confirming the claim, Yelp is free to act as judge, jury and executioner, slapping their racist behavior alert on a business that is likely already struggling due to the pandemic economic shutdowns still strangling the US economy. Any right-thinking individual who was contemplating eating or shopping there will probably reconsider – after all, no one wants to give their money to a bunch of racists. To believe that this won’t be abused by not only amoral attention-seekers and race grifters but also by economic competitors is absurdly naive. With fewer consumer dollars than ever floating around, businesses may find the easiest way to boost their own customer base is to destroy someone else’s. When a large corporation like Home Depot or Goya is ‘unmasked’ as a supporter of President Donald Trump, for example, calls to boycott inevitably follow, and their competitors see a surge in business – a phenomenon experienced by small or regional establishments as well. The racist behavior label still freezes reviews, so vengeful Yelpers can’t slag off the business on the internet. However, while the wanton destruction of commercial establishments seen across the US during the riots of the past five months has simmered down, periodic outbreaks are still leaving businesses in tatters. While the targets may not be planned, it’s not unreasonable to imagine that an establishment tagged as racist on Yelp might be specifically preyed on during the next riot. The Wendy’s where an Atlanta cop shot Rayshard Brooks in the parking lot was burned to the ground by rioters in June, not long after the killing, apparently because employees had called police to remove the unconscious Brooks, who had passed out in his car in the drive-through lane. Even if the reported racist incident is wholly accurate, the ethics of consigning a business to commercial death for what might be the actions of a single employee, especially during a recession, are dubious. If a restaurant is forced to close following a racism scandal amplified by Yelp, it’s vanishingly unlikely everyone who loses their jobs is also a racist – many will no doubt be people of color. Some 450 businesses have had warnings placed on them since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis reanimated blacklivesmatter , and the number is only growing. With unemployment at record levels in the US, what restitution does Yelp offer those who lose their jobs because its labels scared customers away? Perhaps with 60 percent of temporary business closures on the platform due to Covid-19 recently found to be permanent, Yelp has decided protecting the reputations of the businesses that use their platform is no longer a growth industry. But if this social-justice bullying continues, proprietors may find it’s more worth their while to stay off Yelp altogether. Possibly positioning itself for just such an outcome, the platform has also partnered with “Open to All,” a group that charges $10 for window decals marking a business as a no-discrimination zone, to create a diversity-training package for small businesses that can’t afford to hire a real “diversity consultant” to personally lambaste them for their racial sins. Small businesses may be dying, but race-grifting is a bull market. Just as the smearing of lamb’s blood on one’s door during Passover was supposed to protect the ancient Israelites from having their first-born sons slaughtered by an angry God, these “Open to All” signs and the “Black-Owned Business” labels Yelp adopted in June as a search feature may function as a silent plea to be spared during the next riot. But the bat-wielding sociopaths destroying property under cover of blacklivesmatter don’t actually care about black lives or any other social justice cause. Yelp may be aligning itself with the mob, but do businesses really think that rioters will heed their trendy talismans? Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"9 Oct, 2020",Customer review site Yelp debuts racism alert to freeze reviews of pages engulfed in discrimination scandals,"User-generated review site Yelp has unveiled a ‘racism alert’ feature – an icon that will appear on the pages of businesses accused of discrimination. Reviewing is frozen while the accusations are investigated. Trumpeting its“zero tolerance policy to racism,”the siteannouncedthe new feature in a blog post on Thursday, explaining that while it’s great that many users have been using Yelp to air their grievances about businesses behaving in a racist manner, this is sometimes done without“actual first-hand consumer experiences with the business.” The icon, they wrote, is designed to protect both customers and businesses. Appearing beneath a warning exclamation point in a red circle, the alert will pop up when the user navigates to the page of a business“accused of racist behavior,”explaining that the media attention has triggered an influx of negative feedback and reviewing capability has temporarily been frozen. Alerts will include a link to a“news article where they can learn more about the incident.” “As the nation reckons with issues of systemic racism, we’ve seen in the last few months that there is a clear need to warn consumers about businesses associated with egregious, racially-charged actions to help people make more informed spending decisions,”the review platform said in the post. The new feature is an expansion of the previous“Public Attention Alert”warning that Yelp placed on the pages of businesses targeted by“social activism”linked by the company to the blacklivesmatter movement. Since May 26, the day after black Minneapolis man George Floyd’s death reignited blacklivesmatter , Yelp claimed to have placed over 450 such alerts on businesses either targeted by or accused of racism, a 133 percent rise in“media-fueled instances”of review-bombing. Accompanying the rollout is the release of an“inclusive environment”toolkit for small businesses that don’t have the resources to inflict anti-discrimination training on their employees. It s created in partnership with Open to All – an organization that charges businesses $10 to publicize their anti-discrimination policies with a window decal and a“pledge”to welcome all customers regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or other protected characteristics. The inclusivity materials include an hourlong“unlearning bias training video for employees,”social media“assets,”and“outreach language for customers and employees.”Yelp strongly hinted that those looking to be inclusive should join the half-million-plus businesses boasting an“Open for All”icon on their pages, lest they be seen as discrimination-loving reactionaries and lose customers, stating“Increasingly, consumers across the US are voting with their dollars by supporting businesses that align with their values.” Yelp has been touting its potential as a tool for social justice for years, but the arrival of blacklivesmatter has kicked things into overdrive, with reviews highlighting“black-owned businesses”up 617 percent for the summer compared to the same period last year and mentions of“women-owned businesses”increasing 114 percent. The platformdebuteda tool to specifically search for (and identify as) black-owned businesses in June. Last month, Yelp reported that 60 percent of listed businesses that closed temporarily during the economic shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic will not reopen, representing nearly 100,000 companies.

"7 Oct, 2020",Officer charged with killing George Floyd released on $1 million bond from Minnesota jail,"Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis PD officer charged with killing George Floyd this spring, has been released after posting a $1 million bond. Floyd’s death sparked months of riots in Minnesota and across the US. The former officer was released on Wednesday morning from the Oak Park Heights prison, where he had been held in solitary and under maximum security, after posting a non-cash bond. Here s our@FOX9#BREAKINGnews coverage as Derek Chauvin has posted $1M bail & is no longer in custody.#GeorgeFloydhttps://t.co/feQkHTLra2pic.twitter.com/b9nJ4DmcAL Chauvin had been arrested on May 29, four days after Floyd died during a botched arrest outside a grocery store in Minneapolis. He had been held in Oak Park Heights since May 31, as blacklivesmatter protests over Floyd’s death turned violent and resulted in the torching of multiple businesses and the MPD Third Precinct. Video of Floyd’s arrest showed Chauvin kneeling on the African-American man’s neck for almost nine minutes. He was fired on the same day that video emerged on social media, and later charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, which was later upgraded to second-degree murder. Three other officers involved in the arrest were likewise fired, and later charged with aiding and abetting. The lawyers for all four former officers have sought to move the trial out of Hennepin County, arguing that the media coverage of Floyd’s death has prejudiced the local jury pool. Chauvin is the last of the four to be released on bail; the three others were let out between June 10 and July 4, after posting bond. Their trial has been set for March 2021. Like this story?

"1 Oct, 2020","Why say ‘riot’ when you can be vague and sensitive instead, AP Stylebook urges in newest Orwellian guidelines","Used as the journalism Bible by most English-language media, the AP Stylebook has updated its guidance for employing the word ‘riot,’ citing the need to avoid “stigmatizing” groups protesting “for racial justice.” is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic While acknowledging the dictionary definition of riot as a“wild or violent disturbance of the peace,”AP said the word somehow“suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium.” Worse yet,“Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice…”the Stylebook account tweeted on Wednesday. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice, going back to the urban uprisings of the 1960s. (2/5) The claim that something has been used in the past in a racist way has already led to banishing many English terms to the Orwellian“memory hole.”It certainly appears the AP is trying to do the same with“riot”now. Instead of promoting precision, the Stylebook is urging reporters to use euphemisms such as“protest”or“demonstration.”It advises“revolt”and“uprising”if the violence is directed“against powerful groups or governing systems,”in an alarming shift in focus fromwhatis being done towardswhois doing it towhom. There is even a helpful suggestion to use“unrest”because it’s“a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt.” Translated to plain English, this means a lot more mentions of“unrest”and almost no references to“riot,”in media coverage going forward, regardless of how much actual rioting is happening. Mainstream media across the US have already gone out of their way to avoid labeling what has unfolded since the death of George Floyd in May as“riots.”Though protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota turned violent within 48 hours, before spreading to other cities across the US – and even internationally – the media continued calling them“peaceful”and“protests for racial justice.” Yet in just the first two weeks of the riots, 20 people have been killed and the property damage hasexceeded $2 billion, according to insurance estimates – the highest in US history. AP is no stranger to changing the language to better comport to proper political sensitivities. At the height of the riots in June, the Stylebook decided tocapitalize“Black”and“Indigenous”in a“racial, ethnic or cultural sense.” A month later, the expecteddecisionto leave“white”in lowercase was justified by saying that“White people in general have much less shared history and culture, and don’t have the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color.” Moreover,“Capitalizing the term ‘white,’ as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs,”wrote AP’s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski. The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, as its full name goes, has effectively dictated the tone of English-language outlets around the world since it first appeared in 1953. It is also required reference material in journalism schools. So when it embraces vagueness over precision and worrying about“suggestions”and“subtly conveying”things over plain meaning, that rings especially Orwellian – in both the ‘1984’ sense of censoring speech and thought and regarding the corruption of language the author lamented in his famous 1946essay Politics and the English language. pic.twitter.com/s1Cwcusld5 AP is hardly the Ministry of Truth, dictating Newspeak under the penalty of torture. As it turns out, it doesn’t have to be. A bit of updated style – and thought – guidance announced on Twitter from time to time will do. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"27 Sep, 2020","Atlanta fraudster set up ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ group, pocketed $200,000 in donations - FBI","The FBI has arrested an Atlanta activist on fraud charges, after he set up a ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ group to enrich himself to the tune of $200,000. As donations poured in, the suspect bought himself tailored suits and a new house. Sir Maejor Page was arrested on Friday and charged with fraud and money laundering, with the FBI accusing him of misappropriating $200,000 in donations to his organization:‘ blacklivesmatter of Greater Atlanta.’ The organization was founded by Page - a well-known local activist - in 2016, but took in more than $466,000 in donations this June, July, and August, after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, set off a nationwide protest movement. Page claimed that donations to his organization would be used""for George Floyd,""but he allegedly spent nearly half of them on food, entertainment, furniture, tailored suits, according to anFBI affidavitin support of a criminal complaint against him. In addition, Page is accused of using the cash to buy himself a new home in Toledo, Ohio, last month. The home at which law enforcement is raiding in regards to Sir Maejor Page was purchased by the activist organization Hi-Frequency Ohio. That purchase happened last month. Page is one of the leaders of that grouphttps://t.co/YZCbkX8v1w#13abcpic.twitter.com/ZsidUFko9d ‘ blacklivesmatter of Greater Atlanta’ is not linked to the official ‘ blacklivesmatter Global Network,’ and has been under FBI investigation since this April. It lost its tax-exempt status as a charity last year, after it failed to produce tax returns and expenditure files for the Inland Revenue Service. However, it is not the only organization to piggyback off the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ name for nefarious purposes. A California-registered organization known as ‘The blacklivesmatter Foundation’ railedmillions of dollarsin recent years, all while working to support police relations with the community. A noble goal perhaps, but not the goal of the blacklivesmatter Global Network, which has called for the defunding of police departments. The finances of the real movement have also been called into question. Between 2017 and 2019, the blacklivesmatter Global Networkspentonly six percent of its donations on its local chapters and community organizations. A whopping 83 percent, meanwhile, was spent on salaries, bonuses, travel, and consulting. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"24 Sep, 2020",United States of Anarchy: Are Democratic leaders partnering with the rabble to dethrone Trump?,"The war of words between Democrats and the White House ramped up this week as Trump moved to defund cities that prevent police “from doing their jobs.” Will this partisan brinkmanship lead the US straight to the abyss in November? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge The Democratic mayors of New York City, Portland and Seattleissueda joint statement earlier this week in which they accused Donald Trump of“playing cheap political games”after the US leader disqualified their cities from receiving billions of dollars in federal support. Some may argue Trump was right to act as he did, considering that the mayors slashed the budgets of their police forces at the very same time radical activists were burning and looting Main Street. This week, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, chastised the Democratic leaders for refusing to“undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities”amid the blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests that erupted across the country following the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in May. “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,”Barrwrotein a statement on the Department of Justice website.“It is my hope that the cities identified… will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.” Although there is considerable doubt as to whether Trump has the legal authority to deprive cities of federal cash – New York City, for example,receives$7 billion annually from Washington – the Republicans are not about to miss an opportunity to reprimand the Democrats, especially when the country is heading into the final lap before Election Day. With that said, however, Trump seems to have ample justification for punishing the Democrats for their handling of this hot protest season. Although politicians would be expected to demand that their police forces display restraint amid the blacklivesmatter protests, a line must be drawn at full-blown anarchy. In some Democrat-run cities, however, that line never seemed to exist. And if it did exist, it was drawn so far down the road as to be altogether meaningless. Seattle: Antifa black bloc rioters force police vehicles away.#AntifaRiotspic.twitter.com/0RrQPvsimB Consider, for example, the decision by Seattle authorities in June to let protesters seize a six-square-block zone – dubbed the ‘Capitol Hill Occupied Protest’ (CHOP) – which Mayor Jenny Durkan downplayed as the“summer of love,”a remark that has not aged well. Seattle’s brave experiment in anarchistic, police-free living came to a screeching halt in just a matter of weeks aftersporadicshootingsleft two people dead and several others injured. New York City also made Barr’s blacklist, thanks to Mayor Bill de Blasio s decision tocut$1 billion from the New York Police Department’s annual budget at a time when shootings havesoared165 percent in the Big Apple and murders are up by almost 50 percent. Meanwhile, across the country in Portland, city residents just marked a grim milestone: 100 consecutive nights of protests, marred by the destruction of public and private property, violence, and even death. Incredibly, however, Mayor Ted Wheeler – who was forced to find a new home after repeated protests and even anarsonoutside the condominium complex where he was residing – has forbade law enforcement from using tear gas, perhaps the most effective deterrent against mob violence short of deadly firearms. After months of protests, police officers in Portland, Oregon, will no longer use tear gas for crowd controlhttps://t.co/x5fv5zaaCM At this point, it must be asked:“What in the hell are the Democrats thinking?”Few people would doubt the need for overhauling trigger-happy police departments. But reducing their budget to the point of redundancy, as the Democrats are doing, does not seem to be the best remedy; courting the mob at the very same time you are disparaging and decreasing funding for law enforcement is fraught with risk. So why haven’t the Democrats taken a no-nonsense stance against the troublemakers? One possible explanation is that the Democrats, who have been trying to oust Donald Trump since before he even set foot in the White House, had set a trap for the Republican leader. It seems they were anticipating that the brash, tough-talking Trump would eventually lose his patience as the rioters continued with their wave of destruction, which the mainstream media has gone togreat lengthsto sanitize. In an effort to restore some semblance of law and order, Trump would send in the cavalry with both guns blazing and a blood bath would predictably ensue – exactly the sort of calamity that would destroy any hope of reelection. If that is the game the Democrats were playing, they seriously underestimated the US leader... again. Against the advice of many Republicans, Trump has taken limited and measured actions against the rioters, letting the Democrats simmer in a stew of their own making. At the same time, he is constantly reminding Americans that the Democrats are to blame for the mayhem, which shows little sign of abating. That leaves the Democrats with just one option: blame Trump for the violence in return. “He doesn t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat, and he s stoking violence in our cities,”Bidentoldan audience during a recent stop in Pittsburgh.“He can t stop the violence because for years he s fomented it. Finally, there is one more possible reason why the Democrats have taken such a kid-glove approach to the mob, and I’ll just cut right to the chase: the Democrats may be inclined to use these street protesters in the event that Trump emerges victorious against Biden on November 3. It should not be forgotten that a number of high-ranking Democrats, includingHillary Clinton,Maxine WatersandKamala Harris, have strongly hinted at a bitter fight down the road with the Republicans. So if the Democrats’ aim really is to contest the results of the election, the most effective way of doing that is to employ a ‘color revolution’ scenario, where thousands of people – egged on by blacklivesmatter and Antifa – come out onto the streets in mass protest. The Washington establishment has some experience in such things. Whether or not they would be so bold as to resort to such actions inside of their own country remains to be seen. However, since the year 2020 has been full of wild surprises, few of them enjoyable, I can only anticipate the worst on November 3. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"21 Sep, 2020",Disrupting Western family structure no longer among blacklivesmatter s stated goals as manifesto vanishes from website ahead of US election,"The blacklivesmatter activism group has deleted a page called ""What We Believe"" from its website, disappearing such objectives as disrupting the ""Western-prescribed nuclear family structure"" as the Nov. 3 election nears. The manifesto was published on blacklivesmatter s""What We Believe""page at least as long ago as on February 2 but was no longer available as of last Friday. The page is now blank, except for an error message indicating that itcan t be found. blacklivesmatter gave no explanation for its missing manifesto; nor did it offer a comparable replacement, forcing all those curious about the movement’s goals to go to an“about”page, which, in rather general terms, explains its mission to eradicate white supremacy and""intervene in violence inflicted on black communities.”It does not, however, include a belief, featured in the original manifesto, that“the nuclear family structure”should be consigned to the dustbin of history. “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable,”the now-vanished-without-a-trace manifestostated. The group also spoke out at length against""heteronormative thinking,""""patriarchal practice,""men-centered environments and""cisgender privilege,""among other peeves, while repeatedly referring to the supporters of the movement as“comrades.” Whether blacklivesmatter made an unlikely turnaround, or concluded that now is not a good time for a list of its core beliefs to be made readily available to anyone with a Web connection, is up for speculation. Twitter users erred on the side of temporary concealment over any change in values. One said,""They still want it -- they just put it on thesecret menu.""Another said,""They decided it does notpoll well,""while still another said,""The last thing they want is for anybody to know what they rereally all about."" Deleting the manifesto doesn’t change what they believe, everyone finding out is just exposing their depravity. So cleanse it. I hope someone screenshot the manifesto. This isn’t a renouncement. blacklivesmatter enjoyed strong public support when a wave of anti-racism protests across the nation began following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, but its popularity has faded as initially peaceful protests against police brutality descended into riots, arson and outright violence. A Politico-Morning Consultpollpublished earlier this month showed that 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of blacklivesmatter , down from 61 percent in June. Coincidentally, the page disappeared at just about the same time as the New York Times quietly changed the introduction for its controversial 1619 Project, a revisionist tale of US history that President Donald Trump decried as an anti-American,""twisted web of lies.""Without posting a correction or clarification, the Times removed thecentral claimand namesake point of the project – the assertion that America s true founding was in 1619, not 1776.

"19 Sep, 2020",Journalism student at ASU’s Cronkite school CANCELED for tweeting about Jacob Blake warrant,"A journalism student at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School has been fired from her job as manager of the school-run radio station because of her tweet about black man Jacob Blake, shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rae’Lee Klein, who had been pressured to resign by administrators and the student board of directors at Arizona State’s Blaze Radio station, said Thursday that she had officially been removed from her position as manager. She said school officials, including interim dean Kristin Gilger, declined to tell her what rule or rules she had violated. UPDATE: The Cronkite school has officially removed me from my position as Station Manger, despite refusal to inform me of what university/Cronkite rules I violated. Check out the article for the full details. As they know, this is far from over...https://t.co/sp9AvUrV72 The controversy began when Klein retweeted an article from the New York Post about Blake’s arrest warrant on August 28. The warrant included details about allegations of felony sexual assault against Blake, and Klein added a comment to her retweet saying,“Always more to the story, folks. Please read the article to get the background of Jacob Blake’s warrant. You’ll be quite disgusted.” Klein later said in an interview that she was disgusted by the accusations against Blake, which included an alleged violent sexual assault of a woman in front of the woman’s child. But at the time of her tweet, Blake had become the inspiration for violent blacklivesmatter protests in Kenosha after police shot him seven times in the back during a struggle to arrest him. A few days after the tweet, the six-member board of directors at Blaze Radio voted unanimously to call for Klein’s resignation and said it wouldn’t recognize her as manager if she refused. Former student directors of the station issued a statement in support of the decision, saying“students of color will not feel welcome”at the station as long as Klein remains manager. pic.twitter.com/5fcokgzQJr The Cronkite Schoolissueda statement Friday, denying that Klein had been fired from her position.“Any actions that are unfolding are not punishment for a tweet,”Gilger said in the statement.“I have been clear with Rae’Lee that she would not be removed as station manager… because of the views she expressed.” But Klein’s Tweet Thursday included a screenshot of an email from Gilger, reminding her that“staying on as station manager is not an option.”The message was a response to Klein’s refusal of an earlier ultimatum to accept one of three options – being reassigned to another student job, remaining on the board in another capacity, or starting her own radio station. Gilger’s statement Friday said she had offered the student“numerous ways to resolve the situation that take into account the needs of all students involved in the Blaze Radio organization.” Ironically, Gilger is interim dean because ‘cancel culture’ at Arizona Statebroughtdown her predecessor. Sonya Duhe, who was set to become the school’s dean, triggered student and faculty outrage when she posted a tweet in June saying she was praying for the family of George Floyd and“the good police officers who keep us safe.”Former students stepped forward to accuse Duhe of“microaggressions,”and the Cronkite School rescinded its offer to her. After publishing a Q&A article in June in which a student interviewed a former police officer, students complained again. The school removed the article from the internet and replaced it with an apology note. The school is named for the late Walter Cronkite, who was called“the most trusted man in America”during his tenure as anchorman of CBS Evening News from 1962 to 1981. Twitter users, including author Chris DeRose,saidit may be time to remove Cronkite’s name from the school, in light of the decision to fire a journalist for reporting truthful information.“Walter is rolling over in his grave at what journalism has become,”one commenter said. Conservative author Mike Cernovichquestionedwhether federal funding to Arizona State could be halted. Walter is rolling over in his grave at what journalism has become. Other Twitter usersencouragedKlein to sue the university, and some said they were Arizona State alumni and would stop their donations to the school. Many commentersencouragedKlein to keep fighting for truth, saying her career will be boosted by her ouster from Blaze Radio, but onesaid,“Unfortunately, it’s journalism today. There’s no longer journalism. There’s only peddlers of activism.” Wow as an ASU alum, I find this disgusting and abhorrent that they removed you simply for providing a retweet of factual evidence/real news regardless of it being counter to their clearly liberal and biased bs narrative. I will not give another cent to ASU and that hurts to say. Now you became a real journalist - with a national profile - good fortune masquerading as adversity! Keep fighting!

"16 Sep, 2020","George Floyd riots cost insurance companies as much as $2 BILLION - more than any in HISTORY, industry claims","The property destruction from the riots that followed Minneapolis police’s killing of George Floyd was the worst in the history of insurance, with claims costing insurers up to $2 billion, according to an industry group’s report. The tidal wave of arson, vandalism, and other property crimes that swept across the nation in the aftermath of the Floyd killing left between $1 billion and $2 billion in damages, as measured by insurance claims paid out by the industry, areportreleased Wednesday by the Insurance Information Institute (III) has revealed. While that figure represents only the damage done between May 26 and June 8 - meaning the real figure taking into account the destruction in cities like Portland and Kenosha is likely much higher - it still represents the worst riot damage in insurance industry history, according to the report. Previously, only natural disasters like hurricanes and floods had resulted in over $1 billion in damage claims. The sheer scale of the destruction - spread across 140 American cities and lasting for weeks - helped push this year’s riots well past the $775 million damage record previously set in Los Angeles in 1992, following the acquittal of the police officers who beat up and permanently crippled Rodney King. Both victims were black and had criminal records, but the parallels largely end there. In King’s case, the four officers who beat him to within an inch of his life before being acquitted of assault and excessive force were white, while 17 other cops supposedly stood by and watched - and were never indicted. In Floyd’s case, all four officers present have been charged - and the rioters didn’t wait until a verdict to start laying waste to their cities. The Floyd riots were the first time since 1992 that a so-called“civil disorder event”has been classified as a“catastrophe”- a real insurance category, representing anything causing over $25 million in insured losses - according to Property Claim Services, which tracks such claims. This year’s riots also represent the first civil disorder catastrophe to unfold across multiple cities. While unrest continues in some cities, much of the rioting has died down - for now. Insurance companies are bracing for a flare-up in the wake of November’s election, PCS head Tom Johansmeyer told Axios on Wednesday.“There could be riots that lead to significant losses that would meet our reporting thresholds”for catastrophe, he said. Several US intelligence agencies, think tanks, military contractors, and even tech companies have also run election simulations in which contested results lead to widespread civil unrest, including rioting. While it’s unlikely any burned-out business feels fortunate to have to file an insurance claim, those destroyed in the riots are in a better situation than their colleagues driven out of business by the coronavirus pandemic. Despite causing what may be the worst recession in US history, Covid-19-related economic shutdowns are not covered by normal insurance policies. Think your friends would be interested?

"14 Sep, 2020",‘It was an honor wearing David Dorn’s name’: NFL’s Tyler Eifert dons helmet emblazoned with name of black cop killed by looters,"Jaguars tight end Tyler Eifert displayed the name of retired police captain David Dorn, who was shot to death during riots in St. Louis, on the back of his helmet, as his side beat the Colts in the first win of the season. “Great win to start the season. Love being a part of this new team and community! It was an honor wearing David Dorns name on my helmet today!#DUUUVAL,”Eifert tweeted after the Jaguars pulled off a surprise victory over Indianapolis Colts, 27-20. Before the season kicked off, Eifert had repeatedly spoken of his intention to pay respect to the slain police veteran, who was killed on June 2 when trying to protect a friend’s pawnshop from looters who wrought havoc in the city as initially peaceful protests against police brutality turned violent. Great win to start the season. Love being a part of this new team and community! It was honor wearing David Dorns name on my helmet today!#DUUUVALpic.twitter.com/cJYtadhVuS A tribute to the officer was paid by US President Donald Trump, while Dorn’s widow and fellow police officer Ann Dornaddressedthe Republican National Convention (RNC) last month, urging Americans to“remember that every life is precious.” As protests sparked by the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in late May swept across the nation, the NFL announced in June that it would allow players to put the names of“victims of police brutality, and social justice heroes”such as Floyd or Breonna Taylor on their decals. The list of the names approved by the league alsoincludesthat of Dorn, although he arguably does not fall into any of the designated categories. While the league fully embraced blacklivesmatter protests, promoting increasingly woke social justice activism by the players, its season opener TV ratings tanked to a 10-year-low, plummeting some 16 percent compared to the opening game of 2019.

Only local officials have the authority to abolish the police department, the judge ruled on Friday, effectively squelching a bill passed last month that would have put the question before voters in November. The Glynn County Board of Commissioners had filed a lawsuit in August seeking to stop the proposed referendum, arguing that under the state’s constitution, only the commissioners have the right to disband the force. Former Glynn County cop Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault in May, months after 25-year-old Arbery was shot in a struggle between the three men. The altercation was caught on video, but only after that clip went viral were the charges filed. The footage itself – and the delay in prosecuting the McMichaels – helped fuel the blacklivesmatter movement that erupted nationwide with the police killing of George Floyd in May. The US Justice Department is investigating why it took Glynn County police so long to bring charges against their former colleague. At the same time, the state legislature passed a bill in June to dissolve the department, which would place law enforcement for the area in the hands of the sheriff’s office. Kemp signed the bill into law in August, though state law required voters to sign off on it first – a referendum which is now unlikely to happen. McMichael reportedly told police he pursued Arbery as he jogged through the city of Brunswick because the young man looked like a burglary suspect, calling his son to join the chase. Footage of his final moments shows he attempted to grab a shotgun from one of the men, a move that has been spun as either self-defense or aggression by those on each side of the issue.

"9 Sep, 2020",Portland police ask protesters not to start fires amid statewide Oregon wildfire emergency,"As Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a wildfire emergency, police in Portland have asked demonstrators not to start fires, arguing high winds and dry weather could help the blaze spread more quickly and endanger lives. Wildfires in the state have consumed at least two towns, turned the skies red, caused ash to fall like rain and filled the air with thick, acrid smoke. “This is proving to be an unprecedented and significant fire event for our state,”Brown said on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, some 1,400 inmates from three state prisons – Mill Creek, Santiam and Oregon State Correctional – were evacuated to escape the oncoming fires and moved to the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. In the vicinity of Portland, fires burned through Washington and Clackamas Counties, spreading up Mount Hood, and thousands were placed on standby evacuation orders. For the first time in its history, Portland General Electric was forced to shut off the power in several areas in the interests of public safety. The Santiam fire, previously called the Beachie Creek fire, and the Lionshead fire, is estimated to have burned through at least 200,000 acres.

"8 Sep, 2020",Skeptics slam ‘politically-motivated’ study that claims Sturgis motorcycle rally was biggest Covid-19 superspreader event in US,"German researchers claim to have tied a whopping 266,796 Covid-19 cases to a biker rally in Sturgis, South Dakota. That would make it the largest superspreader event in the US – but many are finding holes in their conclusions. Published by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, the Germans’paper lays outsome disturbing numbers. The total public health cost of the 10-day motorcycle rally, which drew almost half a million people to the town of Sturgis during the second week of August, is estimated at a jaw-dropping $12.2 billion, while the rally itself is blamed for 266,796 cases nationwide. The researchers used smartphone tracking technology and health department statistics to monitor the influx of bikers to the small city and trace them back to their home counties. Citing the staggering public health cost generated by their calculations, they claim each rally attendant could have been paid $26,553.64 not to attend in order to avoid the virus spreading. The study also demands more lockdowns and mask mandates as a potential way to mitigate the devastating harm caused by “noncompliant” types. While these conclusions were repeated uncritically across the media andechoed byformer Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb, many on social media – including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem herself – took a closer look at the study and raised questions about both its accuracy and possible political motivations behind it. Noem slammed the paper as “nothing short of an attack on those who exercised their personal freedom to attend Sturgis” in a biting Twitter thread that denounced the researchers’ work as “[not] science. It’s fiction.” Predictably, some in the media breathlessly report on this non-peer reviewed model, built on incredibly faulty assumptions that do not reflect the actual facts and data. (2/) Noting the paper hadn’t gone through peer review, Noem reminded the event’s detractors that their vaunted scientific modeling had also predicted South Dakota would have 10,000 Covid-19 patients swamping its hospitals at the epidemic’s peak. A total of 1,094 patients have ever been hospitalized with coronavirus in the state, with just 68 inpatient as of Tuesday, according to the statehealth department. Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who published a book arguing against the Covid-19 lockdowns that have plunged many world economies deep into depression, also took issue with the numbers the researchers came up with. He questioned how the 260 confirmed cases that had been traced back to the rally as of last week could mushroom into over 260,000 infections. As of Tuesday, just one rally attendee has died with the coronavirus, a man in his 60s with multiple underlying conditions who was hospitalized in an intensive care ward at the time of his death. No, 250 million billion trillion!How stupid do they think we are?A) Positive tests (cases) PLUNGED nationally in August post-Sturgis.B) The number of riders whose cases are directly linked is in the low hundreds - not even 1,000, much less 250,000.https://t.co/Be4nNCoTfS BTW: not that anyone needs to trash the idiotic Sturgis study any further - it has been weighed in the balance and found wanting - but it s worth noting no medical journal would touch it. It was posted on the website of the ""Institute of Labor Economics.""https://t.co/OIczMjHbSd Several journalists did a double-take at the $12.2 billion price tag, which the researchers say assumes a public health cost of $46,000 per case. However, that figure comes from a paper (also publishedby the Institute of Labor Economics) that claimed that as of July 27, there were actually47 millioncoronavirus cases in the US. For reference, there were just 6.3 million confirmed cases in the US as of Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 27 million in the entire world. Journalist Chris Vanderveen pointed out that several counties with a high proportion of Sturgis attendees specifically referenced by the researchers actually saw little or no increase in cases, accusing his fellow reporters of merely reprinting the study’s conclusions without reading it at all – let alone fact-checking it. Jefferson County did see a small bump,... but it didn t sustain itselfhttps://t.co/c5MP13mOAxpic.twitter.com/SfXVOGsfKN To be clear, I m not saying the study is wrong... But I am guessing most reporters reporting on this have yet to even read the studyHere it is if you want to read it:https://t.co/07szutxv9X The researchers attempt to explain away any such discrepancies by claiming Sturgis attendees are “non-compliant” types who tend to avoid Covid-19 testing and contact tracing and thus likely to elude diagnosis. However, a Twitter user claiming to be a Sturgis residentpointed outthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had specifically sought out rally attendees for testing and contact-tracing, hinting the agency was deliberately trying to demonize the event and pointing out that “THOUSANDS of visitors” had come to the town for non-rally purposes. University of Nebraska Medical Center epidemiologist Ali Khan alsoquestionedthe singling out of Sturgis, arguing “that’s how infectious diseases work with mass gatherings events” and suggesting colleges welcoming students back for the fall would experience similar surges. Many also questioned why the researchers had zeroed in on the Sturgis rally while ignoring the blacklivesmatter protests and riots that have raged across the US since the police killing of George Floyd in May, accusing them of a political hit job. Interesting how one event in Sturgis where partiots congregated turned into a supposed super spreader of#COVID19costing $12 billion.Just imagine then, the TRILLIONS in cost and massive loss of life from riots EVERY night in Democrat cities!Where is that study?#MAGAhttps://t.co/MkH7P03dzO The analysis here was:1) calculate a crude number of increased cases in South Dakota and county 2) multiply that by the “costs of COVID” number generated from a study of dubious efficacy3) conclude Sturgis cost $12.2 gorillion Whatever - now do cost of Summer of blacklivesmatter Riotshttps://t.co/mGA4RQdUYK Actually, the paper’s authorsdidresearch blacklivesmatter protests, publishing apaper on the subjectfor the National Bureau for Economic Research back in June. They argued the demonstrations actuallyslowedthe spread of the virus, because many people in the cities where they took place were staying home to avoid the chaos. Mainstream media hailed their conclusions as proof blacklivesmatter protests were actually a boon to public health, and Democratic mayors like New York’s Bill de Blasio and Seattle’s Jenny Durkan rolled out the red carpet for the protesters, even while banning other types of public gatherings.

"7 Sep, 2020",Still ‘mostly peaceful?’: Disturbing Portland ‘Kill press’ graffiti spotted by heavily armored journalists,"A disturbing image purporting to show journalists photographing graffiti which reads, “Kill Press” in the besieged city of Portland has generated shockwaves online, as tensions between activists and the media continue to ramp up. Despite ongoing mainstream media efforts todownplaythe widespread rioting across the US in recent months as“mostly peacefulprotests,”time and time again, blacklivesmatter and Antifa activists and agitators have turned on the press. The rapidly deteriorating relationship between the sprawling protest movements and local and national media was captured somewhat neatly by a photo purporting to show the words“Kill Press”scrawled on a wall in Portland this past weekend. I love how they keep telling us exactly what they areThey say they are racistsThey say Revolution nothing lessThey say Kill The PressThey Say Liberals get The Bullet TooDemocrats refuse to call Antifa And blacklivesmatter Extremists out by name why?https://t.co/flopCOXDQ6 Despite repeated claims of peaceful intent from protesters and theirsympathizersin the MSM, extreme violence has accompanied well-intentioned racial justice and anti-police brutality marches fromSeattletoWashington DC, fromKenoshatoPortland, andNYC. Many online were stunned by the anti-press graffiti,warningthat the violent agitators would“reap what they sow.”Some went as far as describing Antifa and blacklivesmatter as“terrorists,”while others still wondered aloud whether the movements would be declared a national security threat. So far we’ve seen; kill the press, defund the police, burn down the banks...when do we get to call this what it is, an insurrection. CNN’s own headquarters in Atlanta were trashed by protesters in June, forcing the company to erect a Trump-esquewallaround the building to provide additional security for its staff. The families ofJacob BlakeandGeorge Floyd, two black men who were shot by police, sparking major backlash, have made repeated pleas for peace in the streets which appear to have fallen on deaf ears. As protests turned violent this past weekend, members of the mob could be heard shouting:“If you ain’t police, donot record crimes,”in an apparent veiled threat against citizen and independent journalists known to risk their lives covering the ongoing unrest sweeping the nation.

"4 Sep, 2020",Two blacklivesmatter Portland protesters hit with federal felony charges after allegedly targeting cops’ eyes with high-powered lasers,"Two blacklivesmatter protesters have been hit with rare civil disorder federal felony charges after they allegedly targeted the eyes of law enforcement officers with high-powered lasers during riots in Portland. Eva Warner, also known as Joshua Warner, and Hugo Ryan Berteau-Pavy were charged with the offences following separate incidents that took place after riots had been declared by the police. According to court documents, the case against Berteau-Pavy relates to an incident on June 13 around the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. The activist allegedly stood in the middle of the street, after a riot had been declared, and repeatedly hit several officers in the face with high-powered lasers. He is also accused of targeting the mayor’s house and other residences. The incident involving Warner took place on August 8, during unrest in North Portland. The police declared a riot after protesters broke into Portland Police Association’s premises, smashed windows, and set fire to the office. The rioters also used vehicles and dumpsters to illegally block nearby vehicle traffic. During the disturbances, Warner allegedly targeted several officers with a high-powered laser as they attempted to disperse the riot. She was arrested at the scene, and a black pen-style laser was found on her person. Both Warner and Berteau-Pavy had prior arrests on state charges, which were dropped by the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office. The charges bring the number of people facing federal felony allegations over the course of Portland’s summer of unrest to five. The use of federal charges is an illustration that Oregon’s US Attorney’s Office is fulfilling its promise to escalate the consequences for alleged crimes that occur during riots. Portland has now endured 99 straight nights of protests since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police in May. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"3 Sep, 2020",Democratic St. Louis mayor forced to move away from home over blacklivesmatter protests happening on doorstep,"The mayor of Missouri’s St. Louis revealed to the media that she hasn’t stayed at her home since July due to protests in the vicinity, becoming the second Democratic politician forced to relocate by blacklivesmatter rallies. “We have not lived at home for two months,”Mayor Lyda Krewson said in a text message to media outlet STL Today. Krewson and her husband relocated“to de-escalate”the situation and“save police resources”during a series of protests that took place outside her home in the Central West End. Another reason for the move was that“our neighbors were being disturbed and threatened,”Krewsonsaid, adding,“I ran for this job – my neighbors did not.”The mayor said that she hadn’t stayed at her place since late July, and used her and her husband’s own money to temporarily relocate. READ MORE: 4 police officers shot in St. Louis as mayhem over George Floyd’s death rages on Throngs of blacklivesmatter protesters have gathered near Krewson’s house several times in June and July, fuelled by the nationwide outrage over the death of black Minnesotan George Floyd in police custody. Protesters demanded that she defund the St. Louis police department, which she refused to do. Krewson herself defended her stance, insisting that law enforcement need to be funded appropriately and that supporting them“should not be a partisan issue.” Back in late June, demonstrators demanded that Krewson step down after she publicly read out the names and addresses of people calling for police reform. The Democratic mayor laterapologizedto the public, saying she did not intend“to harm anyone or cause distress”by broadcasting the addresses and names in question. Interestingly, one such procession on June 28 passed by the house of St. Louis attorneys Mark and Patricia McCloskey who gained nationwide media attention for standing guard outside their property armed with a pistol and an assault rifle. The couple, who recently appeared among supporters of President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, was then charged for illegal use of firearms. Krewson is not alone in escaping the perils of living in the middle of blacklivesmatter rallies. On Wednesday, the mayor of riots-plagued Portland, Ted Wheeler, announced he left his lavish condo after rioters pelted the building with projectiles on Monday. Staying there would be“unfair to all of you who have no role in politics or in my administration,”the Democratic politician explained. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"1 Sep, 2020","WATCH: ‘Antifa’ militants set fire to black-owned business in Portland, bombard mayor’s apartment with fireworks","A crowd of roughly 200 people surrounded Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s home and demanded his resignation. After multiple fires were lit and nearby businesses looted for fuel, police declared a riot. On the 96th consecutive night of protests in Portland since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police in May, hundreds of protesters, agitators and activists gathered outside the mayor’s home in the Pearl District condominium tower demanding his resignation. The crowd reportedly wore party hats, it was the mayor s birthday on Monday, and sang""happy tear gas to you""while they launched fireworks at the building before a bonfire fire was lit in the middle of the street.

The incident comes just days after a man, believed to be a Trump supporter and affiliate of the Patriot Prayer conservative group, was shot dead in the city. Police are investigating Michael Forest Reinoehl in connection with the death of Aaron “Jay” Danielson, who was shot in the chest and pronounced dead a short time later, but no arrests have yet been made. This is not the first time protesters in the city have laid siege to the mayor’s home over perceived inaction in reforming the city s police department and his role in the police response to the ongoing protests. In June, a short-lived ‘autonomous zone’ was established in the mayor’s neighborhood before being torn down by Portland police a short time after it was set up.

"29 Aug, 2020",Democrats have directly encouraged violence on the streets. Winding it back isn’t going to be easy,"Protests and riots have spiraled out of control in the US. However, these aren’t spontaneous demonstrations. Instead they’re egged on by Democrats, who seem hell-bent on burning America to the ground. To those fed a diet of mainstream media disinformation, the protests sweeping the US are just that: protests. They’re grassroots affairs, expressions of discontent and resentment at a status quo that oppresses African Americans and denies them the rights and privileges afforded to whites. That may have been true for all of about a day following the death of George Floyd back in May, and some of the protesters no doubt still feel that they’re fighting the good fight. But far more have taken to the streets to commit brazen acts of violence, looting, and criminality. Thousands have been injured, and more than 32 people have been killed, including the two shot in apparent self-defense by teenager Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha on Tuesday night. The riots have been enabled by Democrat leaders who have at best excused and at worst encouraged the most base excesses of the mob. The mob’s latest target was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Paul and his wife were accosted by a screaming crowd of rioters outside the Republican National Convention in Washington, DC on Thursday night. Explaining the event to Fox News on Friday, Paul said that“had they gotten at us they would have gotten us to the ground, we might not have been killed, might just have been injured by being kicked in the head, or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless.” If any Democrat can claim credit for inspiring violent street harassment, it’s California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Back in 2018, Waters told her supporters that if they come across an ally of President Donald Trump in public,“you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” As you watch all the videos of Trump supporters getting targeted and attacked outside the White House tonight, here’s a reminder that one of the Democrats’ leading voices, Maxine Waters, literally encouraged this behavior.pic.twitter.com/v5o4bxWpKO Her supporters followed her words to the letter,harassing and threateningRepublican officials on the streets and in restaurants throughout that summer. However, the violence has since escalated, just as the rhetoric has. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley – a member of the so-called ‘Squad’ and media darling –calledlast week for mobilized“unrest on the streets”against the Trump administration. Way back in June, as Minneapolis and Portland burned, Kamala Harris, now Joe Biden’s running mate, warned the public that the riots are“a movement”that’s“not gonna stop.” Kamala Harris says that the riots are not going to stop, ever, and to BEWARE. With a smile on her face.pic.twitter.com/xkwAUOMJcL “Everyone beware,”Harris exclaimed.“They’re not gonna stop before election day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after election day. They’re not gonna let up and they should not.” A good friend of mine once called the American left wing the“Interahamwe Left.”Given the events of recent months, the comparison is apt. The Interahamwe were a Hutu political movement in the Rwanda of the early 1990s, and helped perpetrate a sickening genocide against the country’s Tutsi minority. Immediately before the butchery began in 1994, a Hutu radio station put out a cryptic broadcast:“Cut down the tall trees.”Hutus across the country took up rifles and machetes and slaughtered an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsis in the course of three months. The genocide was merciless, with neighbor killing neighbor in villages, schools, and churches. That broadcast came after a year of anti-Tutsi radiomessaging, during which Hutu spokesmen ginned up hatred against the Tutsi. Just like the Hutus did in Rwanda, the American left has shut off all avenues for rapprochement and reconciliation. Just look at theharassmentof anyone who refuses to prostrate themselves before the woke mob. Then look at the barbarism that leftist mouthpieceswish upontheir enemies. While it’s true that street violence is a world away from systematic execution, the messaging of the American left is in some way similar. Except the democraticparty doesn’t need to cloak its message in the poetic euphemisms of the Interahamwe. Instead they simply instruct their street fighters to go out and raise hell. Not a single prominent Democrat has issued a clear and unequivocal denunciation of the violence. Joe Biden meekly pleaded with the mob this week to show some restraint, but that only came about after a marked drop in his polling numbers. It’s unlikely that they’d listen anyway. If they were open to reason, the crowd shouting“Breonna Taylor”at Rand Paul would realize that Paul actuallytried to passthe Justice for Breonna Taylor Act in the Senate earlier this summer. The Act would have banned“no-knock”warrants, like the kind Louisville Police Department were serving when they shot Taylor dead in March. But the crowd has gotten a taste for violence, and long since abandoned reason. Biden, Harris and the democraticparty likely saw opportunity in the blacklivesmatter movement. They could praise the protesters in the streets, using the images of thousands of marching demonstrators to highlight the failings of the Trump administration. They could even close their eyes and let the rioters loose as their unofficialTonton Macoutes, terrorizing political opponents. However, even with these boogeymen affecting Democratic poll numbers, it is unlikely that Biden’s wheedling will calm them down. They’ve been fed too much encouraging agitprop for that. Should Biden and Harris manage to win this November, Harris might get exactly what she asked for. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

Protesters blared music, shouted slogans and beat drums in the nation’s capital on Thursday, many gathered not far from the White House, where Trump gave his acceptance speech to a live audience of more than 1,000 on the final night of the RNC.

"28 Aug, 2020","Widow of retired police officer David Dorn, slain during blacklivesmatter riots, to speak at RNC as Dems lose ground on lawlessness issue","The widow of retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn, who was shot to death in June during a violent blacklivesmatter protest, could become the most important voice among Thursday’s Republican National Convention speakers. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. That’s because Ann Dorn will broach and humanize a subject that has emerged as perhaps the most troubling issue facing Democrats heading into November’s election: law and order. Dorn will talk about the horrible pain she has suffered as a result of her 77-year-old husbandbeing murderedwhile trying to protect a friend’s pawnshop from rioters. She will offer the additional perspective of a current law enforcement officer, as she’s also a St. Louis police sergeant. Her words will call attention to the escalating violence and criminality that has occurred since protests broke out across the nation in the wake of Minneapolis black man George Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have successfully turned that issue against Democrats, who for months have tried to downplay and ignore the mayhem. It’s one of the biggest reasons that Trump’sapproval ratingshave risen in recent weeks. Support for Trump got another boost with this week’s deadly protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a black man was shot in the back seven times by police on Sunday. CNN host Don Lemon acknowledged the political problem on Wednesday, saying the riots are“ablind spotfor Democrats.”Lemon suggested that lawlessness is the one issue that could torpedo Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s chances of winning:“It’s showing up in the polls. It’s showing up in focus groups. It’s the only thing right now that is sticking.” Media outlets have posted articles critical of Ann Dorn’s speech even before she speaks. Several of those pieces, including an International Business Times story on Thursday, citedDavid Dorn’s daughtersas saying they don’t want his widow to speak at the RNC.“It’s very frustrating because I know my dad did not agree with a lot of Trump’s policies or procedures,”said one of the daughters, Debra White. The other daughter, Lisa Dorn, was quoted as saying:“We don’t want his death or his legacy or any of his images to be used for political gain.” Another line of attack came in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial on Wednesday saying that Ann Dorn’s speech would miss the point. Trump has sought to blur the line between peaceful protests against racial injustice and opportunistic criminals who exploit such protests, the newspaper said. The widow also will fail to address thereal crisisthat contributed to David Dorn’s death, easy access to guns, the editorial added. Unfortunately for Democrats, as the focus groups cited by Lemon have shown, Americans are increasingly inclined to blame those who are committing the violence and those who are trying to look the other way.

"26 Aug, 2020",Taking cues from Don Lemon? Biden rushes to condemn Kenosha riots after CNN host says Dem silence ‘shows up in the polls’,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has denounced the “needless violence” that has gripped Kenosha for three days, prompting critics to suggest that his delayed response was due to bad poll results. Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.Is this the country we want to be?Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice.pic.twitter.com/WdNqrxA3PK As Kenosha is bracing itself for a potential fourth night of violent unrest that has already seen numerous local businesses ransacked and torched, Biden released a video statement, urging protesters to stop destroying their own communities. Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence – violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community The chaos in Kenosha has alreadycosttwo people their lives. Biden s admission that it was a far cry from a peaceful blacklivesmatter rally came shortly after prominent CNN host Don Lemon opined that, by keeping quiet on the crisis, Democrats risk losing the demographics the former VP needs to have on board in the November election. “It’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups,”Lemon said, speaking to fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo on Tuesday evening. In the rare criticism of the democraticparty , Lemon said that it was“ignoring this problem or hoping it will go away,”adding that neither appears to be happening any time soon. The timing of Biden’s statement was not lost on conservatives, suggesting that he was moved by his polling numbers rather than by the plight of the businesses he referred to in his message when he took aim at rioters and looters. “I noticed that CNN said your polls were probably down because of the rioting. I’m guessing that’s why you finally mentioned about rioting and the violence being wrong. I think it was Lemon that said it,”a commenter said. I noticed that CNN said your polls were probably down because of the rioting. I’m guessing that’s why you finally mentioned about rioting and the violence being wrong. I think it was Lemon that said it. Well, it seems, at least,@JoeBidenlistened to Don Lemon’s advice.pic.twitter.com/tRhzAp3xmw Just say ""I got the new polls and people do not like riots, looting and violence so I’m gonna pretend now after months of calling them peaceful that I now discourage it"" Others accused Biden of jumping on the bandwagon by coming out against the violence“90 days too late.” Joe, this plead and running mate’s attempt to finally come out against the violence is 90 days to late. You continue to amaze most of America with your lack of addressing issues real time. You continue to show your true lack of empathy to Americans. Some maybe fooled but most not The poll numbers cited by Lemon have not been made public. However, public polls tell a similar story. Asurveyreleased by Marquette University Law School on Wednesday found that approval of street protests has dropped from 61 percent in June to 48 percent this month. Support for the blacklivesmatter movement has also fallen by 10 points, to 49 percent, while support for the police has increased and only 17 percent of respondents agree with defunding police departments – a core demand of some blacklivesmatter activists and Democratic politicians. While parts of Kenosha have been almost reduced to scorched earth in the three days following the Sunday shooting of black man Jacob Flake by police, violence has also marred the protests against police brutality for three months in the wake of the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody in late May.

"25 Aug, 2020",CBS News whitewashes Kenosha destruction as mostly peaceful protests as city smolders in aftermath,"To some in the mainstream media, the wave of arson and destruction that swept over Kenosha, Wisconsin was nothing more than “peaceful protest” that “gave way to clashes.” Don’t believe your lying eyes, they may as well have said. The Wisconsin city of Kenosha burned for a second night in a row on Monday, as rioters defied a police curfew and torched local businesses and law enforcement buildings. Some were armed, and even as Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called in the National Guard, furniture shops, car lots, correctional facilities, and random vehicles were razed to the ground by the mob. That’s not quite how CBS News saw it though. According to anchor Gayle King on Tuesday, the riots began as“peaceful protests, which is what the blacklivesmatter is really about.” “It’s not clear if those setting fires were involved in the initial demonstrations,”King said. Yet as she described blacklivesmatter ’s supposedly peaceful methods, CBS played scenes of vehicles engulfed by fire, crowds jumping on cars, and businesses still smoldering from the night’s anarchy. A second day of peaceful protests gave way to clashes overnight in Wisconsin.This comes after 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back by police as he tried to get into his car. He remains hospitalized in stable condition.@MolaReportshas the latest.pic.twitter.com/4Ljb0hZFq0 According to King, the protests spontaneously“gave way to clashes”as night fell. Reporter Mola Lenghi further appeared to excuse the destruction, telling viewers that“setting this truck on fire right here behind me is how some protesters have responded to the authorities’ use of stun grenades, [and] of tear gas.” By Tuesday morning, hours of video footage from Kenosha circulated online, showing that the protests were anything but peaceful. HOLY SH*#: while interviewing this# blacklivesmatter rioter in Kinosha he pulls out a real pistol and points it at my camera while explaining what we would do to cops if they rolled up on us right now It’s been a while since I had a gun pointed at me even if it was just to make a pointpic.twitter.com/hjQqO9Ccbb Kenosha earlierpic.twitter.com/8Q0kPC94mD CBS instead focused on the event that triggered the riots – the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake on Sunday. Blake was shot in the back seven times by officers as he attempted to get into his car, collapsing in front of his children. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times that Blake is now paralyzed from the waist down. The network wasn’t alone in whitewashing the riots. The New York Times alsodescribedMonday’s events as“peaceful marches”that“gave way to fires and destruction.”On CNN, a banner described the protests as“fiery but mostly peaceful.” The latest conflagration in Kenosha isn’t the first riot to be given the“peaceful protests”treatment by the media. As the first wave of blacklivesmatter protests hit Minneapolis in May after the police killing of George Floyd, MSNBC’s Ali Veshi reassured viewers that the scene was“not generally speaking, unruly.”As Veshi spoke, abuilding burnedimmediately behind him. When anarchists occupied Seattle’s Capitol Hill district two weeks later, the Seattle Times described the short-lived ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone’ as a“loose, egalitarian”paradise of“free snacks,” “free of uniformed police.”In reality, the zone was a lawless place, where vigilante justice reigned, thieves profited, and by the end of June, four peoplewere shot, two fatally. The disconnect between narrative and reality was noticed on Twitter, where conservatives mocked CBS’ friendly coverage of the Kenosha riots.“You could describe D Day as a peaceful boat trip across the English Channel that gave way to clashes on the beach,”one commenterjoked. “Peaceful...gave way to clashes” No, thugs and lunatics engaged in riots, arson, and looting- which everyone was expecting- because the mainstream media is full of cowards who pay for their houses in the Hamptons by running cover for blacklivesmatter criminality on behalf of the DNChttps://t.co/EuOULtjd5f Read the tweet then watch the footagehttps://t.co/9VD9l7Fb4S Think your friends would be interested?

"20 Aug, 2020","‘No apologies whatsoever!’ Chicago mayor defends ban on protests in HER neighborhood, vows to do anything to protect home & family","Progressive Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has insisted that a ban on demonstrations in her neighborhood is necessary to ward off any threats to her family, despite vocal support for citizens’ right to peacefully protest elsewhere. The Chicago Police Department has ordered officers to bar protesters from Lightfoot’s Logan Square neighborhood and arrest any who refuse to leave, the Chicago Tribunereportedon Thursday, citing a recently surfaced police directive from July. Though the progressive Democrat mayor has frequently applauded“peaceful protests,”she argues the ban is needed for her own safety. “I think that residents of this city, understanding the nature of the threats that we are receiving on a daily basis – on a daily basis – understand I have a right to make sure that my home is secure,”Lightfoot told reporters when asked about the directive, though declined to outline any examples. I’m not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, I’m going to do everything I can to make sure they’re protected. I make no apologies whatsoever for that. Since a wave of mass demonstrations kicked off after the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement in Minneapolis, crowds of activists have gathered outside Lightfoot’s home on several occasions to protest against police brutality and department funding. Following one event in late July thatdrew hundredsto the neighborhood, however, police have largely kept demonstrators away, apparently enforcing the CPD directive. Through the weeks of unrest – which in Chicago has frequently descended intoriots and looting– Lightfoot has vacillated between support and vocal condemnation of protesters. In aleaked recordingof a conference call with city officials published in June, the mayor said Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez was“full of s**t”when he voiced concerns about violent protests reaching residential neighborhoods. Yet just one day prior, the mayor issued aharsh statementslamming protests that had“devolved into criminal conduct,”saying some activists showed up“armed for all-out battle”with police, though she has continued to encourage“peaceful”demonstrations since. READ MORE: Chicago mayor urges citizens to call cops on feds, so she can sue Trump for ‘abuses’ in crackdown on gun crime The order banning protests on Lightfoot’s block makes no distinction between peaceful and violent protest, however, saying the neighborhood“should be locked down”and that officers should immediately call for back-up at the first sign of a gathering. But despite a constant police presence around the mayor’s home, no arrests have been made on her block since the order was issued earlier this summer, with only two“public peace”violations reported there since July 21, according to city statistics cited by the Tribune.

"16 Aug, 2020",America the elites ignore: Driving through US ‘flyover country’ in a time of Covid-19,"The establishment clustered in big coastal cities often derisively refers to the rest of the US as “flyover country.” It’s this area, though, that makes the beating heart of America – as I realized during a recent road trip. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Earlier this month, due to a tragic family event, my wife and I found ourselves on the road to Minnesota from Washington, DC. Normally we would fly, just like most Americans traveling across such distances, but there was no time to make those arrangements. So we drove 1,100 miles across eight states – and back again – within a week. Though the plural of ‘anecdote’ is not ‘data,’ those looking at America strictly through the lens of statistics and models tend to focus on the forest but miss the proverbial trees. With that in mind, here’s some of what we saw along the way. Make of it what you will. Whenever we’d get close to a city, the roads would fill up with vans and small trucks rented by movers. This would track with themounting evidencethat Americans who can afford it are picking up stakes. Whether it’s because of their city or state’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, job opportunities elsewhere, or the collapse of law and order in the wake of“racial justice”protests-turned-riots that broke out at the end of May, I can’t even venture to guess. On the long stretches of highway between cities, we spotted quite a few big trucks used for long-distance moves, too. These big rigs are the actual primary users of the US Interstate Highway System. The 18-wheeler tractor-trailers dominate the US cargo industry, carrying nearly two thirds of all freight. Moreover, most American businesses are structured around the idea of just-in-time delivery, rather than keeping stocks of unsold merchandise. That actually caused massive shortages of certain products at the start of Covid-19 lockdowns in March. Anything that gets in the way of the big rigs, then, spells bad news for the US economy. As we passed them on the road, I recalled a June report from awebsiteserving commercial drivers, saying that four out of five truckers polled would refuse to deliver to cities that defunded their police departments, citing safety concerns. Austin, Texas just voted to cut its police budget by a third. Another dozen cities havealready done so, from New York City and Los Angeles to Baltimore. Portland and Seattle, still plagued by rioters, have cut funding to their police as well. Minneapolis, where the most recent wave of blacklivesmatter protests began in late May over the death of George Floyd, actually voted to abolish its police department entirely! One doesn’t have to be particularly observant to spot a potential problem with this, barreling down the road like an out-of-control tractor-trailer. In most gas stations, restaurants and convenience stores we visited along the way, employees and customers dutifully wore face masks. A few people, locals by the look of them, seemed otherwise inclined. Nobody hassled them or made a scene. Halfway through Illinois, an older gentleman sitting across from us at a burger joint groused about the governor’s tyrannical mask mandates. He was diabetic, he said, so he needed to work out – but just quit his gym membership because they demanded he wear a mask while exercising indoors. His story reminded me of the ongoing saga of a New Jersey gym, which tried reopening in defiance of the governor’s orders, only for its owners to be arrested and their premises boarded up. Later I found out that the state took away their business license – just as Michigan did to a barber that reopened in defiance of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s orders, back in May. The barber was eventually vindicated by the state supreme court. The owners of Atilis Gym are still fighting their fight. Small business owners like these took the brunt of the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns. Others profited from them; many of the big rigs we saw along the way belonged to Amazon, whose stock has skyrocketed as physical stores closed and shopping moved online. Driving halfway across America and back – 2,200 miles, give or take – we saw some evidence of the sentiments along the way by the political signage put up alongside the roads. During the entire trip, we spotted exactly two signs supporting Joe Biden, and at least a dozen supporting President Donald Trump. They ranged from a cargo container parked next to the interstate and used as a canvas, to a hand-written cardboard sign posted at the entrance to a farm. Cars with Trump bumper stickers also vastly outnumbered the near-nonexistent Biden (or Clinton-Kaine) ones, so common in the greater Washington, DC area. More than one person we spoke with also joked that the pandemic will mysteriously vanish on November 4, the day after the election. Oh, the virus is real, they elaborated, but the media and the political establishment have overhyped it for partisan purposes. Looking back on this on Day 150 of“15 days to stop the spread,”I can see where they re coming from. What happens in parts of America we drove through largely doesn’t matter to the NY-LA-DC establishment. Even Minneapolis, where the George Floyd riots started, was quickly forgotten as the“cultural revolution”emerging from them went national. Only a few independent reporters, like Michael Tracey, actually bothered to travel to places devastated by the riots. I m finally home today after two months. A sincere thanks to everyone who made this trip a success!https://t.co/j4L1Heqdtf Yet it is these vast expanses that grow the food the coastal“elites”consume – once in pricey restaurants, now via  high-tech delivery. Though they have happily outsourced much of America’s manufacturing overseas – turning the once-proud industrial states into the Rust Belt – some things required for US global hegemony are still made in the Midwest; we drove past the sprawling M1-Abrams tank plant in Lima, Ohio. This relationship bears an uncanny resemblance to the attitudes of the Capitol toward the Districts in the ‘Hunger Games’ novels. Those were supposed to be a dystopian warning, however, not a roadmap. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"15 Aug, 2020","‘Come on, don’t do this’: Yahoo slammed for shoddy story accusing RUSSIA of antifa.com prank of Joe Biden","The latest chapter in the conspiracy theory blaming Russia for ‘meddling’ in US elections accuses Moscow of somehow redirecting the website Antifa.com to Joe Biden’s website, thanks to some major internet illiteracy at work. On Wednesday, Republican activist Matthew Foldi pointed out that typing Antifa.com in one’s browser redirected to Biden’s campaign page, just as the Democrat candidate and his freshly chosen running mate Kamala Harris were about to do their first joint public appearance. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨GO TOhttps://t.co/0GjUAwwcXbRIGHT NOW!!!!! When a One America News correspondent at the White House asked President Donald Trump about it, however, that was a red flag for her Yahoo! News colleague Hunter Walker. To hear him tell it, OAN is a pro-Trump network that promotes“conspiracy theories”and employs someone who also works for Sputnik, which is“Russian propaganda.” So he looked into the internet records for Antifa.com and breathlessly reported it was“linked to – wait for it – Russia”!According to his article, the domain was“registered in the Russian Federation from 2013 through last July.” The Russian-linked ""antifa"" website that OAN brought up in the White House briefing used to feature a message encouraging people to ""join"" antifa. There was no contact info and the message just linked back to itself.https://t.co/UfCAMB0yjY Interestingly, that whole bit about OAN employing someone from Sputnik got MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow in hot water recently, and she had to argue that her showisn’t actually newsin order to dodge a defamation lawsuit over calling the network“really literally paid Russian propaganda.” In any case, Walker’s report was uncritically picked up and promoted by PropOrNot, a shadowy anonymous outfit notoriouslymisrepresentedby the Washington Post as experts on Russia and propaganda. According toMashable, however, the Yahoo story“substantially misunderstands”the archived history of the domain. The reason Russia turns up is because WhoisGuard, a privacy service, used a contractor based in St. Petersburg at the time. That alone“does not tell us anything about where the registrant is actually based,”Mashable added, conceding that Russia“could possibly be”behind the redirect, but there is“zero proof”of that. Wait, is this whole story and its claim about a link to Russia solely based on the fact that whoever first registeredhttps://t.co/gWkzvrn4Klused a Russian domain prviacy service? That’s it?! Come on, don t do this.https://t.co/zQfkS2oh9F BuzzFeed reporter Craig Silverman also slammed Walker’s article as shoddy, noting that it hinges solely on the fact that whoever registered antifa.com once used a Russian domain privacy service. “That’s it?! Come on, don t do this,”Silverman tweeted, adding,“Don t cite domain records if you don t know what they mean! Yahoo should retract this story.” Confronted with these findings, Walker stood by his claim, saying that“the little public info we have on this site that had an odd George Floyd protest message and popped up in the [White House] briefing is a link to Russia.” Of course, private registries don t definitively identify the owners but the little public info we have on this site that had an odd George Floyd protest message and popped up in the WH briefing is a link to Russia.https://t.co/UfCAMB0yjY Apparently anything can be a“link to Russia”these days – especially for Yahoo News, a major player in the ‘Russiagate’ conspiracy narrative. It was their chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff who famously first reported the existence of the ‘Steele dossier’, a collection of salacious claims about President Donald Trump and Russia compiled by British spy Christopher Steele for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. Isikoff later recanted about the Steele Dossier, but not before getting a sweet deal on a book about the“inside story of Putin’s war on America and the election of Donald Trump.” As for Walker, he seems to be afraid of so much as a shadow of anything Russian. Back in June he infamously refused to retweet a livestream of blacklivesmatter protests in Washington – after desperately searching for one – only because it came from Ruptly, which he warned his followers was“state owned Russian media.""

"13 Aug, 2020",Pompeo feels insulted when quizzed about US crackdown on protesters at home after he bashed ‘authoritarian regimes’ for same,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took offense at the suggestion police abuse of protesters at home had anything in common with behavior he criticizes in “authoritarian regimes,” deeming the comparison “incomprehensible.” Asked during an interview Wednesday with Radio Free Europe whether the heavy-handed US response to protests “on its own turf” had “harmed America’s image” abroad, the American diplomat lashed out at the reporter, denouncing the question as “insulting.” “The difference between the US and these authoritarian regimes couldn’t be more clear,” Pompeo insisted, reminding his interviewer, “we have the rule of law, we have the freedom of press, and every one of [the protesters being arrested] gets due process.” To somehow suggest that America’s moral authority is challenged by the amazing work that our police forces, our law enforcement do all across America, I frankly just find the question itself incomprehensible and insulting. It’s hardly the first time Pompeo has been reminded of US inconsistency regarding its sanctimonious pronouncements about other countries’ crackdowns on “peaceful protesters” – or the press, for that matter. A staunch defender of the right of some Hong Kong residents to express their discontent with Chinese rule by destroying their city, Pompeo was confronted with the disconnect between Washington’s indulgence of those “protesters” and its brutality toward some blacklivesmatter protesters back in June. Then, too, he brushed off the notion of a “moral equivalency between what takes place in these countries where they repress their people” and the US. Despite Pompeo’s praise of their “amazing” work, US cops have killed more people in the few months following George Floyd’s death at police hands than Chinese cops have in the entirety of the Hong Kong protests. And while the US diplomat spent the past few months praising America’s press freedoms, the Trump administration was kicking dozens of Chinese journalists out of the US and severely curtailing the operations of Chinese media organizations. Even the secretary of state’s invocation of religious freedom as that which sets the US apart rings a bit hollow given that American places of worship have been prohibited for months from holding services due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while Wal-Marts and military contractors have been able to operate uninterrupted. Pompeo launched what US media called his “anti-China, anti-Russia tour” in the Czech Republic earlier this week. He promised to deliver “freedom” to Belarus, where a landslide election in favor of incumbent President Aleksandr Lukashenko has brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets declaring the vote to have been rigged.

"11 Aug, 2020"," If they don t stand for the national anthem, I hope they don t open : Donald Trump issues fresh NFL anti-kneeling barb","Donald Trump has again outlined his view that no sportspeople should kneel during the national anthem, saying that he would rather the NFL didn t begin its season than see blacklivesmatter protests before games. Speaking to a Fox Sportsmorning radio showon Tuesday, the US president spoke on a range of topics, including Tom Brady s recent move from the New England Patriots to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but soon hit one of his more favored sports talking points: the wave of athletes across multiple disciplines kneeling before games, or during the national anthem, to protest police brutality and promote equality. Trump s stance has long been a consistent one, and dates back to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick popularizing the blacklivesmatter movement before a game in 2016 - and this time around he says that he would rather not see football at all than have to sit through players exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest. ""If they don’t stand for the national anthem, I hope they don’t open,""Trump said, adding that the owners of the league s various teams are well aware of his stance. ""They know my feelings very well, they’ve been expressed."" Trump, meanwhile, lauded the NHL s pregame demonstrations in which players opt not to kneel and with no blacklivesmatter imagery being displayed on uniforms or otherwise - while being critical of both the MLB and the""very nasty""NBA s whose pregame demonstrations included both. He also criticized the television ratings that the basketball league was getting, saying without evidence that people were""very angry""at the situation. The NFL has yet to outline any specific plans for pre-game demonstrations ahead of the league s expected start in September, but there are highly likely to take place given that Kaepernick first popularized the expression on the side of an NFL field. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who was once a vocal opponent of the kneeling protests, admitted in a statement following the death of George Floyd that the league took an incorrect stance under his leadership. ""We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" Goodell said in a statement in June. ""We, the National Football League, believe blacklivesmatter ."" However, Trump clearly isn t on the same page. ""You have to stand for your flag, and you have to respect your flag and your country,"" Trumpsaid. ""You’re making millions of dollars a year playing a sport you’d be playing anyway, they’d be playing it on the weekends. ""And they have to respect their country. If they don’t, frankly, if the NFL didn’t open I’d be very happy."" RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"7 Aug, 2020",Oprah teams up with Women’s March founders to whitewash their reputations by piggybacking on Breonna Taylor killing,"Billionaire media mogul Oprah Winfrey has bankrolled 26 billboards in Louisville calling for the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor to be charged. Like too many “saying her name,” though, Winfrey’s campaign reeks of grift. Helen Buyniskiis an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 Winfrey began deploying the billboards on Thursday – one for each of the 26 years of Taylor’s life – and they are expected to be in place by Monday. The displays read “Demand that the police involved in killing Breonna Taylor be arrested and charged” and feature a link toUntilFreedom.com, a “racial justice organization” founded by Women’s March co-founders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, hip-hop artist Mysonne Linen, and civil rights lawyer Angelo Pinto. The TV billionaire has jumped onto the Breonna Taylor bandwagon with both feet, also featuring the slain black woman on the front cover of her O Magazine for September – the first time in over two decades the publication has featured anyone other than Winfrey herself on its cover. The cover photo is the same image as the one appearing on the Louisville billboards, which also feature a giant “O” Oprah Magazine logo, facilitating maximum brand recognition. Taylor was infamously shot by Louisville police as she lay in bed in the early hours of March 13 as officers served a ‘no-knock’ warrant, supposedly looking for drugs – even though the dealer they suspected of using the apartment as a stash house was already locked up. The cops’ failure to identify themselves as they broke into the apartment led Taylor’s boyfriend to shoot at what he thought were burglars. The officers fired back, hitting Taylor eight times and killing her. While the Louisville City Council unanimouslyvoted to banthe controversial no-knock warrants that led to her death in June, the police responsible were only recently fired and still haven’t been charged with her murder. Taylor’s tragic death – as well as the failure to punish those responsible – has become a cause célèbre among the blacklivesmatter movement and the parade of grifters operating in its midst. Despite her billions, Winfrey hasn’t hesitated to recast herself as a victim of discrimination amid the racial reckoning which has roiled the US over the past three months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She launched a new series on Apple TV+ in July called ‘The Oprah Conversation’, devoted to castigating her white audience for their supposed racism and encouraging her black audience to blame white people for their problems. Guests like former NFL player Emmanuel Acho and bestselling “antiracist” author Ibram X. Kendi have joined her on the show to push her divisive message. In last week’s episode with Acho, Winfrey declared “the system of white people” was responsible for keeping black people off “the ladder of success.” No matter how poor a white person might be, the TV personality stated, “you still have your whiteness.” Unsurprisingly, a woman whose net worth is north of $2.6 billion lecturing white people about their privilege didn’t go over very well – Winfrey was excoriated for her tone-deafness on social media, and even by some in the mainstream media. The Taylor billboard campaign would be an easy distraction from her pushing her victim act a little too hard down her adoring public’s throat – after all, who can fault a billionaire using their money to demand justice for a young woman murdered in her bed by police? Winfrey is far from the only celebrity virtue-signaling over Taylor’s body – well-heeled opportunists from actress-turned-royal Meghan Markle to the entire NBA have deployed her name as a virtue-signaling talisman. Until Freedom, too, is going all in on Taylor. The New York-based group announced earlier this week they would move their entire team to Louisville to organize “day in day out” until those responsible for her death were held accountable. Co-founders Sarsour and Mallory were booted off the Women’s March board last year, supposedly for “antisemitism,” over their refusal to distance themselves from controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Who wouldn’t benefit from a little whitewashing under the aegis of blacklivesmatter ? Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"6 Aug, 2020","WATCH dozens of FBI & SWAT agents raid mansion of YouTuber Jake Paul, seize ‘multiple rifles’ amid probe into looting & vandalism","Dozens of FBI agents and SWAT officers have raided the sprawling California mansion of controversial YouTube star Jake Paul, seizing several weapons amid an investigation into looting and vandalism at an Arizona shopping mall. “The FBI is investigating allegations of criminal acts surrounding the incident at Scottsdale Fashion Square in May 2020,”the bureau said in a statement on Wednesday. A SWAT team seized numerous firearms from YouTube star Jake Paul’s Calabasas home today - including semiautomatic rifles and shotguns - after the FBI issued a search warrant as part of an investigation.pic.twitter.com/Mg2qJcEqEK The agency noted that a separate search warrant was also executed in Las Vegas, but said no arrests had been made. The YouTuber was not present at the time of the search. The raid on Paul’s Calabasas residence was captured in photos and videos that circulated on social media. The officers were seen carrying a number of rifles out of the mansion. The FBI has raided the Calabasas mansion of YouTuber Jake Paul. The raid is in connection to Paul’s involvement in a looting at an Arizona mall. Multiple firearms were removed from the residence.No arrests are currently planned.pic.twitter.com/se4AVgqSHl Paul was charged in June with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly after appearing in a video at a mall in Scottsdale, Arizona, near Phoenix, where protesters were seen vandalizing and looting stores. While police in Scottsdale have clarified that those charges have since been dropped, they said a federal probe is ongoing. “It has been decided that in the cases charging Jake Paul, Arman Izadi and Andrew Leon, it is in the best interest of the community to dismiss misdemeanor charges without prejudice so that a federal criminal investigation can be completed,”the police said in a statement on Wednesday, referring to two others who had been charged alongside Paul. I was one of the few who pointed out that when Jake Paul went to a mall while it was being looted he did so comfortably making videos because he was accompanied with men holding rifles.

"2 Aug, 2020",‘Do as they say’: Minneapolis police warn people to obey criminals for their own safety as violent crime surges amid blacklivesmatter protests,"Embattled Minneapolis police are advising residents on survival skills amid a wave of violent crime, offering such tips as “be prepared to give up your cell phone and purse/wallet” to robbers and “do not walk alone.” “Do not argue or fight with the criminal,”police said in a July 28letterto Third Precinct residents.“Do what they say. Your safety is most important.” The Third Precinct, southeast of downtown, was one of the areas hardest hit by the protests-turned-riots that broke out following the May 25 killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Ensuing demonstrations and riots in the adjoining cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul marked the second-most destructive incident of civil unrest in US history. Police wereforced to abandontheir Third Precinct headquarters for their own safety on May 28 as rioters pulled down a fence and set the building on fire. Minneapolis City Government tells residents to be ready to give up their phones and wallets and to always cooperate with criminals:pic.twitter.com/qQhw4YLRSY Carjackings and other robberies have skyrocketed in the wake of the blacklivesmatter protests. Police said there were 20 carjackings and 100 other robberies reported in July in the Third Precinct alone.“Some victims have been maced, dragged, assaulted and some threatened with a gun,”police said in the warning to locals. In an era of rising crime and a push by many on the left to defund police and“reimagine”law enforcement in Democrat-controlled cities, the self-help tips in Minneapolis may be a sign of things to come. The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously in June to replace the city s police department with a“department of community safety and violence prevention, which will have responsibility for public safety services prioritizing a holistic, public health-oriented approach.” The plan will need approval from voters in November, meaning it will primarily affect police resources after 2020, but the city last month took $1.1 million out of this year s police budget to fund a Health Department program in which staff are sent out to“mediate”violent conflicts. Some Minneapolis residents are already adjusting to deteriorating public safety by setting up armed patrols in their neighborhoods. Minneapolis police are operating under a court order that bans such tactics as choke holds and requires that any use of rubber bullets or other crowd-control measures be approved by the police chief. More than 150 officers filed disability claims for post-traumatic stress disorder and other injuries suffered during the protests. In Seattle, where officers were banned altogether from using crowd-control weapons, Police Chief Carmen Best warned business owners last month that her department would have“no ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.” Seattle City Council members introduced aresolutionFriday to create a new community safety department that would replace much of the police force. Police also have been restrained by city leaders in Portland, which had 15 reported homicides in July, the highest monthly total in more than three decades. There were 63 shootings reported through the first 29 days of July, police data showed, up from 28 in all of July 2019. Newsmax journalist John Cardillo, a former New York City policeman, saidin a tweetthat the Minneapolis letter essentially tells residents to“prepare to be robbed, obey criminals and hand over their belongings. This is where we are now.” Like this story? Share it with a friend! RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

"1 Aug, 2020",Is it still about the shoes? Nike’s latest ad builds on the company’s tradition of slickly-edited propaganda & hypocrisy,"What have skateboarding Muslims and kneeling quarterbacks got in common? They’re all part of the same social justice struggle, according to Nike. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Woke Capitalism is at it again. Released on Thursday, Nike’s ‘You Can’t Stop Us’ ad is simultaneously an editing marvel (its editors reportedly sifted through 4,000 hours of footage to get those split-screens and transitions right) and an unknowing parody of woke culture. No scene illustrates Woke Capital™’s hunger for all things intersectional than a shot featuring a skateboarding girl in a niqab (is this what you call Radical Islam?) seamlessly morphing into a leather-jacketed transsexual holding a smoking rainbow flag. Entire books could be written about this 4 second clip from the new nike adpic.twitter.com/dIadAMlfde The ad has racked up more than 25 million views and has been lauded as an aesthetic masterpiece. It’s easy to see why. The combination of inspiring music, sublime editing, and beautiful cinematography makes you want to cheer, until you consider how utterly ridiculous the scene is. Is Nike suggesting that religious teachings that oppress and degrade women are somehow empowering? Or is the young skater’s transition into LBGT activist a sign of what awaits Muslim societies in a woke-ified world? Whatever the answer, perhaps the Uighur Muslims reportedlyslavingaway in Nike’s Chinese factories will finally feel represented, no matter how Haram the imagery. From black women overcoming some ill-defined doubt, to athletes of all colors taking a knee for ‘ blacklivesmatter ’, to soccer star and perennial liberal narcissist Megan Rapinoe pontificating on making the world a“better place,”no ethnic or social splinter group is left unmentioned in this 90-second compendium of wokeness. The ad is right about one thing for sure: Woke Capital can’t be stopped. It can’t be stopped from absorbing, packaging, and profiting off righteousness. Walmart won’t pay its staff a living wage, yet pledged $100 million in June to open a“center focused on racial equity.”Apple, another corporation that uses Chineseslave laborto manufacture its products, kicked in the same amount to eradicate racism. McDonald’s, whose restaurants havecontributedto black America’s shocking 75 percent obesity rate, has taken up the niche cause of black trans rights, for some reason. “Black trans women have a very simple message: stop killing us” -@imarajoneshttps://t.co/KLsZbLzH7ipic.twitter.com/F7IGLPlAK4 Nike, however, is the undisputed king of wokevertising. From making anthem-kneeling quarterback Colin Kaepernick the face of its 2018 ‘Believe in Something’ campaign, to wheeling out amoralizing sermonon race relations just four days after George Floyd’s death, the company has evidently figured out that crises sell more shoes (and more breathablesports hijabstoo). Selling shoes must be Nike’s aim, because the alternative is twice as bizarre. That alternative is that Nike, a global megacorporation whose pockets are lined with the profits of slave labor, has appointed itself chief propagandist for a movement to dismantle the power structure of America on behalf of the ‘oppressed’ women, blacks and Muslims of the world. It’s that Nike, a company thatdonatesto Republican candidates every election cycle, supports an anti-police organizationfoundedby“trained Marxists,”whosestated aimis to destroy“capitalism, patriarchy and colonialism.”It’s chipped in $40 million dollars to this organization and those like it. It must be about the shoes, right? Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"31 Jul, 2020",Trump vows to deploy National Guard to quell Portland s ‘beehive of terrorists’ if feds fail to stop unrest by ‘tomorrow’,"US President Donald Trump said he would send National Guard troops to quell chaotic protests in Portland, condemning activists there as a “beehive of terrorists,” as federal units deployed to the city prepare to withdraw. Trump warned of a National Guard deployment during a Thursday press conference, one day after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck a deal with Oregon Governor Kate Brown to phase out federal police stationed in Portland, where they’ve worked with local authorities to defend a federal courthouse and other government property. Though the withdrawal was set to begin on Thursday, the president said National Guard troops would effectively replace the federal agents should the unrest continue. “Our people are staying there to see whether they can do it today and tomorrow, and if they don’t do it we will send in the National Guard, and we’ll take care of it,”Trump said, labeling the protesters“professional anarchists”and“people who hate our country.” We’re telling them right now, that we’re coming in very soon, the National Guard… So [federal agencies are] working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. “These are people that hate our country.”Trump says if local law enforcement in Portland doesn’t disperse “this beehive of terrorists,"" he will send in the National Guardpic.twitter.com/DHjLiR019T As part of the federal withdrawal deal, Portland law enforcementcleared outtwo large protester encampments set up in city parks on Thursday morning, as the spaces are located near federal properties that have been under siege by demonstrators for more than two months, including the courthouse. The protests have frequently become violent, seeing regularclashesbetween activists and police, with some demonstrators arming themselves with improvised weapons andsmallexplosives. Police have also come under fire for heavy-handed tactics, with federal agents accused of wielding excessive force and“kidnapping”protesters off the street, using unmarked vehicles. Despite the agreement, DHS chief Chad Wolf said the withdrawal would only proceed once the agency is confident federal properties will be secure, leaving some question as to when the de-escalation will actually take place. Wolf noted that“we anticipate the ability to change our force posture”in Portland once conditions on the ground“significantly improve.” Federal agents were deployed to Portland earlier this month as part of a new multi-agency task force created by executive order in June, which aims to protect statues, historical monuments and other federal buildings. Such government properties have become common targets for anti-police brutality activists in recent months, amid a wave of mass protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in May.

"28 Jul, 2020","Dems, media allies cry foul after republicanparty leader ‘hijacks’ Barr hearing with video showing violent side of protests","A US House hearing meant by Democrats to excoriate Attorney General William Barr got off to a rocky start Monday as ranking Republican Jim Jordan showed a video montage of violent protests raging across the country. The video began with clips of more than a dozen media outlets and Democrat leaders describing the wave of anti-racism demonstrations as""peaceful protests,""followed by the widow of retired St Louis police captain David Dorn speaking about the murder of her husband by a looter on June 2. Video of rioting, looting and arson then begins to play with the widow s speech continuing. Immediately after the seven-minute video ended, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said,""Well, I hope that Mr Jordan will never complain about the length of my opening statement.”He added that Republicans had violated policy by failing to give the committee 48-hour notice of a video exhibit. CNN dismissivelydescribedthe video as showing""scenes of protesters and police clashing.""It also called into question the veracity of the footage:""While numerous anti-racism protests broke out after the killing of George Floyd, it s not clear where or when the videos in the republicanparty montage were taken."" Most of the clips were well known scenes from the recent protests, such as anarchists cutting through a security fence outside the federal courthouse in Portland with a power saw, a Target store being looted, and a protester clubbing New York s police chief over the head. Large fires can be seen over the shoulders of some of the reporters describing""peaceful protests."" Nadler and the other Democrats on the committee moved on to grilling Barr and suggesting that he may need to be impeached, but PBS and NBC journalist Jeff Greenfieldtweetedthat Jordan s video""pretty much hijacked the hearing before Barr testifies. I don t recall anything like this in all the years I ve been watching hearings.""Greenfield has been in journalism more than 50 years, including stints with CNN, ABC News and CBS News. Aaron Morrison, a race and ethnicity reporter for the Associated Press, said the video was selectively edited and misleading.""As someone who covered the protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere, Jordan s video doesn t show that the vast majority of Floyd protests have been peaceful,""hesaidon Twitter. NBC legal analyst Maya Wiley called Jordan s strategy divisive and manipulative.""It willfully ignores what we must unify to solve and how law enforcement violence instigates more,""she tweeted. #DavidDornis rightly mourned. The divisiveness of#JimJordanstrategy is to manipulate what we agree on - the sanctity of life. It willfully ignores what we must unity to solve and how law enforcement violence instigates more.#BarrHearing CNN contributor Dean Obeidallah took the criticism up several notches:""It says so much that the republicanparty leader, Jim Jordan, opened with a video that expressed zero sympathy for George Floyd or mentioned that blacklivesmatter ,""hetweeted.""Instead, he showed a Klan-like collage of images of black people looting."" The vehement reactions showed that Jordan clearly struck at the heart of the escalating political fight in Washington: fundamental disagreements over what Americans are seeing before their very eyes in the blacklivesmatter and Antifa protest movements.

"27 Jul, 2020",Wear a mask: Joker spotted jet skiing around NYC amid massive blacklivesmatter marches (VIDEOS),"Given the theatrical quality to much of the civil unrest across the US lately, it should come as no surprise that a man dressed up as the Joker was spotted jet skiing in New York’s East River. DC Comics stalwart and Batman arch nemesis (not to mention cliche halloween costume for the painfully unoriginal) the Joker was spotted blowing off some steam this weekend, apparently swapping the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City for the…crime-riddenstreets of New York.

"25 Jul, 2020",Nearly HALF of viewers abandon A&E after network cancels hit show ‘Live PD’ to appease anti-police crowd,"The A&E TV network has seen its viewership dive bomb after dropping its popular cop-based reality show ‘Live PD.’ Though the woke move decimated its prime time audience, the channel insists the decline is only “temporary.” Some six weeks after A&E shelved the show – which followed on-duty police officers on patrol in real time – the network’s prime time viewership has tanked by 49 percent, according to Nielsen ratings data first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday. Its total daily average viewership collapsed by more than a third. Though the network labeled the drop as a“temporary hit in the ratings,”the impact has been even greater for a key adult-aged demographic, declining 55 percent for those aged 18 to 49. A&E’s decision to cancel the show last month came amid a wave of anti-police brutality demonstrations, which erupted nationwide following the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement in May. At the time, the company said it would“determine if there is a clear pathway to tell the stories of both the community and the police officers whose role it is to serve them,”noting it would meet with“civil rights leaders as well as police departments”as it reassessed the show. ‘Live PD’ also spawned a number of spin-off shows, all of which were scrapped along with the original series in June. Together, the shows made up 85 percent of A&E’s programming during some weeks. The cancellations have not gone over well with the show’s large fanbase, however, with former viewers taking to social media to demand a revival of the series, some even encouraging a boycott of the channel. A&E has apparently not ruled out bringing the show back, telling the Journal that it is“continuing to listen to both community leaders and ‘Live PD’ fans to find a way to serve both moving forward.” The hit TV show was not the only cop-themed program to get the axe in recent months, with the Paramount Network giving the pink slip to its iconic ‘Cops’ series in June, which ran for a whopping 32 seasons. The onslaught on police-themed shows even triggered a semi-sarcastic rumor that the children’s cartoon ‘Paw Patrol’ was next on the chopping block – a claimechoedin seriousness by the White House spokeswoman as recently as Friday afternoon. A Nickelodeon spokesperson has since dispelled the idea,reassuringits audience the show isn’t going anywhere. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"24 Jul, 2020","Federal forces ‘on standby’ to enter Seattle, if protests turn violent & local cops need support","A tactical unit of federal agents has been placed on standby in Seattle to aid police should protests there spiral into unrest or rioting, the New York Times reported, a move that comes amid heated objections from local officials. A Special Response Team operating under the authority of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was reportedly dispatched to Seattle on Thursday, as a precautionary measure. “The CBP team will be on standby in the area, should they be required,”the Federal Protective Service said in a statement about the operation. An agency spokesman who declined to be named, told the NYT that the border agents were sent to back up other law enforcement in protecting federal buildings, but would only be called into the streets if protests escalate to unrest. The decision mirrors similar efforts in Portland, where federal agents have squared off with protesters in recent days, amid weeks of heated demonstrations there that have frequently seen violent clashes between activists and law enforcement. Earlier on Thursday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee insisted no federal agents would be used in the city, stressing that he did not want to see a repeat of Portland – where reports of unmarked officers snatching protesters off the street have evoked sharp public outcry and clashes with the feds. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has voiced similar opposition to the use of federal law enforcers, however it isn’t clear if they will be able to prevent the deployment, as Oregon officials have taken up similar objections to no avail. The federal units are part of a Department of Homeland Security task force created by US President Donald Trump in June. In an executive order, Trump mandated the protection of federal property and monuments – which have become frequent targets for anti-racism and police brutality protesters across the US – seeing officers from a slew of federal agencies deployed in various cities to back up local police departments. Though most of those operations have been short-lived – some lasting only through the July 4 weekend, for example – Portland has seen a much longer deployment, as agents remain there to defend a government property besieged by protesters, including a federal courthouse. Seattle has seen a wave of demonstrations since the death of George Floyd in a botched arrest attempt in late May, with protesters taking over the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood for several weeks earlier this summer after police abandoned the area. While city officials initially put up little resistance to the occupied zone – known as CHOP for short – the cop-free encampment was dismantled after some five separate shooting incidents and several deaths.

Protesters had been camped out for weeks in a tense standoff with city authorities, as they called for the police to be defunded amid the groundswell of anti-police brutality protests across the country in recent weeks. Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed he had stripped $1 billion from the NYPD budget but many felt it was just politicking and cooking the books rather than any meaningful change. There had been repeated scuffles and clashes leading to multiple arrests since the ‘Occupy City Hall’ encampment took shape in late June amid mass blacklivesmatter protests across the US and beyond in the wake of the George Floyd killing by the police in Minneapolis.

"22 Jul, 2020","‘We won’t retreat’: DHS chief defends ‘proactive arrests’ amid Portland riots, stokes Minority Report dystopia outcry (VIDEOS)","The head of the Department of Homeland Security set off alarms after saying that federal agents were making ‘proactive’ arrests in Portland amid heated protests, drawing comparisons to the dystopian “pre-crime” of Minority Report. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf appeared on a Fox News segment on Tuesday night, discussing the ongoing protests and rioting across Portland, which he says have continued for“52 nights in a row”as federal officers there are stretched to the limit. “Because we don’t have that local law enforcement support, we are having to go out and proactively arrest individuals, and we need to do that because we need to hold them accountable,”Wolf told Fox’s Martha MacCallum. This idea that [protesters] can attack federal property and law enforcement officers and go to the other side of the street and say ‘you can’t touch me’ is ridiculous. We don’t do that in any other type of law enforcement. The comments soon inspired countless comparisons to Minority Report, Philip K. Dick’s 1956 classic in which a technologically advanced police division sniffs out“pre-crime,”locking up hapless suspects before they commit any offense. The Trump admin has now reached the Minority Report phase of this dystopian nightmare. The only thing that s missing is the precogs.https://t.co/6AToO55rhi In other words, they re arresting people who haven t actually done anything wrong. Welcome to 2020: Minority Report Edition.https://t.co/zMdfsfjHaC Weren t proactive arrests the premise of the Spielberg movie Minority Report?Wasn t that supposed to be a futuristic sci-fi horror story?pic.twitter.com/Vw3RiY4rGN Some argued that“proactive arrests”are“not a thing”under US law, apparently referring to the need for probable cause, while other critics said federal agents were effectively kidnapping“innocent”and“peaceful”protesters. “Proactive arrests” is very much not a thing under United States law.https://t.co/jrBZgkMxlh Last time I checked, a “proactive arrest” was kidnapping. Proactive arresting? Just say it: Arresting people who have not committed an act that warrants arrest. You know—innocent, peaceful people. The DHS says the protests have not remained peaceful, insisting it has been“forced”to make arrests to keep agents safe, with Wolf repeatedly citing lack of support from local police. “What is occurring in Portland in the early hours of every morning is not peaceful protesting,”Wolf said at a Tuesday press briefing, adding“If you are a violent rioter looking to inflict damage to federal property or law enforcement officers, you need to find another line of work.” We will not retreat. We will continue to protect our facilities and our law enforcement officers. A growing number of federal agents have been deployed to Portland in recent weeks as protests rage on in the city – kicked off in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody in May. Under an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump in late June, a federal task force was created to protect historical monuments and other federal property from vandalism, which have become a frequent target for activists. Since the deployment began, reports have emerged from the city that unmarked agents aresnatching demonstratorsoff the streets, some seemingly at random, however the DHS insists its tactics are legal.

"20 Jul, 2020",AP says it will NOT change style for ‘white’ after capitalizing ‘Black’... to not encourage ‘white supremacists’,"The bible of writing rules for news organizations across the Western world – the Associated Press Stylebook – has made its ruling on uneven treatment of skin colors, and it turns out it might be in favor of the practice after all. One month after changing its style guide to require capitalization of the word“black”when referring to black people, the Associated Press wire service said it won’t do the same for the word“white.” “White people in general have much less shared history and culture, and don’t have the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color,”the APsaidon Monday, in an article about its decision. The company said anti-racism protests following the killing of George Floyd on May 31 had prompted it and many other news organizations to re-examine their practices. There is, at this time, less support for capitalizing white. White people generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color. (5/8) AP rules are highly influential in setting standards for word choices, punctuation, and other style points, because most English-language news outlets use the guide as their own or as a default position when their own policies don’t cover a topic. The book is also a required reference for many journalism students. The wire service acknowledged that its decision over“white”was“more ticklish”than its June 19 ruling on“Black.” “We agree that white people’s skin color plays into systemic inequalities and injustices, and we want our journalism to robustly explore these problems,”John Daniszewski, AP’s vice president and editor-at-large for standards, said in a memo to staff on Monday. Capitalizing the term ‘white,’ as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs. AP decision-makers apparently didn’t consider the possibility of people of other skin colors giving themselves special deference out of racist beliefs. The decision brought a mixed reaction, with some Twitter users calling it racist and others cheering the move. “Wow, that’s not racist at all, except for the racist part,”said one, while another said,“The alt-left mob is inside your house.”A supporter tweeted,“It makes perfect sense. I’m honestly sorry that you either don’t understand it or don’t want to understand it, but it absolutely makes sense.” That s racist.Treating one race of people differently than another.Definitely violated federal EEOC laws It’s not treating anyone different, my love. It’s simply changing a letter, to celebrate a culture that was repressed in history. It’s not treating someone differently because this change literally does not impact you life The day the@APStylebookjumped the shark. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Many news organizations had already made rulings of their own on the issue, with the New York Times, NBC News, and others saying they would capitalize“Black”but not“white”– and Fox News and CNN saying they would capitalize“White”and“Black”along with other ethnic group names. CBS News said it would capitalize“White,”except when referring to white supremacists, white nationalists or white privilege. Sorry,@APStylebook, but you dithered too long. Most newsrooms probably have their own style by now. For us, it’s Black and White. When the AP revised its style guidelines in June, it ruled that both“Black,”and“Indigenous”would be capitalized, along with other ethnic identifiers, such as Latino. The company said at the time that it was still deliberating on treatment of the word“white.” Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"20 Jul, 2020","Grab a shovel, America! This election season the fake news, hoaxes and tell-all books are flowing fast down the pipe","Amid an epic political battle for the White House, Americans can no longer believe what they read and hear in the media. This is a dangerous reality for the nation, which needs accurate information to meet a flurry of challenges. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Every four years, the US mainstream media should be required to carry a surgeon general’s warning on its TV and print publications that states: ‘Consuming mainstream media in an election year may critically impair a voter’s ability to make rational decisions due to skewed information. Use at your own discretion.’ Anyone who doubts that statement may wish to consider the impressivehatchetjob that CNN’s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta performed last week when quoting White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. In an effort to explain that the Trump administration was in favor of opening schools amid the Covid crisis, McEnany told a press conference:“The science should not stand in the way of this… the science is very clear on this... We encourage... localities and states to just simply follow the science. Open our schools.” Despite the straightforwardness of the message, Acosta tweeted out to his 1.7 million followers just 10 words from McEnany’s monologue, the part where she said:“The science should not stand in the way of this.”That deliberate distortion prompted thousands of misinformed people to accuse the Trump administration of practically being neo-luddites and ‘anti-science.’ Was Acosta’s shoddy reporting just an oversight, or could it be chalked up as a politically motivated hit job against the Republicans with presidential elections just over 100 days away? Considering the mainstream media’s well-known history of negative reporting on Donald Trump, it is very tempting to go with the latter explanation. pretty dishonest journalism here. CNN’s acosta cuts off the quote, doesn’t give full context, and goes viral. (15K RTs, 23K likes in an hour)correction gets way less engagement (300 RTs, 1K likes)media does this stuff constantly and they still wonder why nobody trusts them.pic.twitter.com/B0j049Z3WK Speaking of coronavirus, perhaps there wouldn’t be so much anxiety in the home of the brave over getting kids back to school if the American people were getting reliable data on the disease. Thus far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Amid fears that the number of Covid cases is being padded, possibly due to the political incentive, it was revealed that a 20-year-old Florida man who died in a motorcycle crash was listed as a Covid-related death. How many other deathsarebeing wrongly dropped into the Covidcategoryis anyone’s guess, but many high-ranking officialsbelievethere are serious problems with the tallying of numbers. It’s this sort of willingness to jump to unreasonable conclusions over a highly sensitive issue that may have led NASCAR race driver Bubba Wallace to confuse a garage door opener for an actual noose, thereby inflaming racial tensions at the worst possible time. Was there any sort of political motivation behind the claim, which has been debunked by an FBIinvestigation, that a ‘hate crime’ had been committed? That is hard to say, but it cannot be ignored that the incident – coming at the very same time America’s streets were being overrun by blacklivesmatter protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death – sparked a war of words on Twitter between the African-American NASCAR driver and Donald Trump. Has@BubbaWallaceapologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER! Meanwhile, amid the ongoing hysteria over Covid and race relations, Russiagate may seem like ancient history, yet that didn’t prevent it from floating to the surface again last week. It happened as Attorney General William Barrdeclassifiedtwo documents that proved beyond reasonable doubt the FBI was aware of some dozen inaccuracies in a 2017 New York Timesreport, the most devastating being that Trump officials were having contacts with Russian intelligence officers. The discovery presented a nice opportunity for America’s purported ‘paper of historical record’ to set the record straight with regards to the political witch hunt, prompted by unfounded accusations in the so-called ‘Steele Dossier,’ which hounded the Trump administration for four long years. Yet the New York Times has chosen to cling to its story, refusing to provide either an apology or a retraction to its readers. “We stand by our reporting,”saidEileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman. And then there were, of course, the books – tell-all screeds from confidants and even family members close to Donald Trump – with their tantalizing tidbits of information that the media promised would sink the US president’s political career once and for all. Former US national security adviser John Bolton, for example, who Trump dismissed in September 2019, released ‘The Room Where It Happened’ in June. As regularly occurs in Washington DC, which has arguably the worst plumbing in the world, a copy of the manuscript wasleakedonline in January, at the very same time – surprise, surprise – Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry. Despite the heated anticipation over the prospect that the book’s revelations would help drive Trump from office, the fanfare trickled out when even Bolton himselfadmittedhe had no ‘silver bullet,’ as it were, to help the Democrats’ cause. Another election-year blast, entitled ‘Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World s Most Dangerous Man,’ was released by none other than Trump’s niece. Where Bolton hoped to demolish his former boss with a cheap he-said, she-said expose from inside of the White House, Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, hoped to accomplish the same by detailing aspects of Trump’s family life. At one point in the book, Mary Trump revealed how her father’s family had been left out of her grandfather’s will, with the bulk of the family fortune passing to the favored Donald. After that revelation, she writes:“Donald, following the lead of my grandfather and with the complicity, silence and inaction of his siblings, destroyed my father. I can’t let him destroy my country.” Could Mary Trump’s book be dismissed as a case of sour grapes, or even ‘fake news’ by a disgruntled Trump family member? It seems entirely possible. That is precisely the problem with such tell-all memoirs; the veracity of the claims is difficult to prove since they rely on the hazy recollections – not to mention the personal prejudices – of the storyteller. In any case, both books, which have gone on to sell millions of copies, provide fodder against the US president in the most hotly contested US presidential election in many years. This leads us to the question: what can the American voter truly believe this election year? The answer seems to be ‘absolutely nothing.’ From fudged reports emerging from White House press briefings, to the muddled memories of former Trump confidantes and relatives, it seems that everything is tainted in some way by political intrigue. As happens every four years, truth has fled the American house. The difference this time around, however, is that an ominous cloud of violence, unrest and upheaval hangs over these elections like never before. Therefore, with every fake news story that gets circulated, the chances that the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election will turn ugly only increases. After all, people are not stupid, and they are very good at understanding when they are being fooled. Yet the only thing Americans can put their faith in these days is that the uncertainty will only continue, straight up to November 3. What the morning of November 4 will look like in America is anybody’s guess, but I doubt fake news will be able to conceal it. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"19 Jul, 2020",‘Do we name Fort Bragg after Rev Al Sharpton?’ Trump says he may veto renaming of military bases honoring Confederate generals,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act over the proposed purge of military base names that honor Confederate figures, telling Fox News, “Yeah, I might.” Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Trump told anchor Chris Wallace that renaming bases wouldn’t go down well.“Go to the community, say, ‘How do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name it?’ And ‘We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton’?”he said, referring to the black civil rights activist and minister. Renaming Confederate-honoring military installations is part of the provisions and recommendations contained in Congress’s annual defense authorization bill, the NDAA. It was included in response to the blacklivesmatter protests that erupted across the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill! Trump threatened to veto the $740 billion defense bill over the renaming of military bases earlier in July. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters in June that he wouldn’t sign any legislation that included any mention of renaming bases,sayingthe idea was a“non-starter”for the president. Calls to remove Confederate statues and the Confederate flag have intensified in the past few months. Many consider them to be offensive because Confederate fighters in the 1861 US civil war were fighting to uphold slavery. Trump and others see it as a free speech issue, as the flag is part of the culture of southern US states. Trump told Wallace that the Confederate flag was not a race issue, as“when people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag – it represents the South.” We can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. WATCH: President Trump on violence in our cities, the battle over police funding, and ""cancel culture."" Check your local listings#FoxNewsSundaypic.twitter.com/s6G6PewEel The Confederate provision was added to both the House and the Senate’s versions of the NDAA bills. The Senate addition was introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and passed in the Republican-led Senate Armed Services Committee, while the House provision was a bipartisan addition by Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md) and Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb). Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ken) and top House Republican Kevin McCarthy (R-Cal) were among those Republicans who said they wouldn’t oppose the idea. Trump’s first threat of a veto was alsometwith apathy from many Republican politicians. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"17 Jul, 2020","No-fly zone: Pentagon effectively bans Confederate, LGBT and blacklivesmatter flags from DoD property","The Pentagon has effectively banned the Confederate flag at US military sites around the world, without explicitly saying so, in a new policy unveiled on Friday. A Department of Defensememohas outlined the flags that are deemed acceptable to display in Department of Defense workplaces and common areas – and the Confederate flag is not among those listed. The LGBT pride flag and blacklivesmatter banners are also absent from the list of acceptable emblems. A draft version of the policy reportedly banned the Confederate symbol outright, accordingtoPolitico, but the published version just details the types of flags which may be displayed, such as those of US states, military services, and flags belonging to allied countries. The approved emblems“must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols,”Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in the memo. “The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges,”an unnamed defense official told Reuters. President Donald Trump views the Confederate flag issue as one of free speech, and criticized NASCAR’s decision to ban it in June. Following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May, calls to ban the flag and remove statues of Confederate figures intensified as protesters demanded action to tackle racism. The controversial flag was used in the Civil War in 1861-65 by Southern states which fought for the continuation of slavery. Today it is viewed by many Americans as offensive, because it is seen as an approval of slavery and a symbol of racism. Others say it is part of the South’s culture and a reminder of those who died in the war. The ban has exceptions, including displays in museums, on license places, grave sites and in art, where it is clear that the flag is not being endorsed by the DoD.

"16 Jul, 2020",Danish ice cream maker to rebrand ‘Eskimo’ desserts over RACISM concerns,"Danish ice cream maker Hansens Is will rebrand its ‘Eskimo’ desserts over apparent racist connotations, following complaints by a politician from Greenland. The move was met with mixed reaction online. ""After much thorough reflection, we have decided to give our Popsicle ‘Eskimo’ a new and more appropriate name,”Hansens Is said in a Facebookpost, citing the ongoing global debate over“derogatory treatment and inequality towards minorities and indigenous people.” The company has opted to call the chocolate-coated vanilla treat“O’Payo,”the name of the chocolate used in making the dessert. According to the social media statement, the offensively-branded sweets will remain on sale until the“warehouse is exhausted,” at which point the politically correct packaging will appear. The decision was made after Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a politician representing Greenland in the Danish parliament, claimed the term means“eater of raw meat.” “Eskimo has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders. So I think it is only natural to show this level of respect for us,”Larsen said. Greenland, a former Danish colony-turned province with a high degree of autonomy, boasts some 55,000 mostly Inuit inhabitants. “Didn’t know Eskimo was condescending... I think it’s discrimination against me to change history to make others happy... so no more Hansen ice cream in my freezer,”wrote one clearly upset Facebook user. “The story doesn’t go away because you stick your head in the bush,”added another. One commenter cited the 10,000+ ‘angry’ reactions to the Facebook announcement as an indication of how poorly the decision was received by fans of the frozen lolly, to which a fellow Dane pointedly responded:“F**k the ordinary Danes’ attitude about something that isn’t about them.” In mid-June, Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream changed the name of its ‘Eskimo Pie’, which had been on sale since 1920, to avoid offending any Arctic peoples. However, Danish ice cream maker Premier opted not to bend the knee to the PC brigade and said it would keep its ‘Kaempe Eskimo’ (Giant Eskimo) ice cream name. “But we do not see at all that the name is associated with racism and may offend anyone. It is, in turn, a name associated with nostalgia,”Premier Is Director Claus Dahlmann Larsen said. The debate echoes similarcontroversieselsewhere, with a number of companies opting to change well-known brand names and logos, such as Uncle Ben’s rice, Aunt Jemima’s syrup and many others, amid the groundswell of anti-racist sentiment in recent months, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

"15 Jul, 2020",NYPD’s top uniformed officer & 2 other cops attacked by blacklivesmatter counter-protest group crossing Brooklyn Bridge (VIDEO),"A small group of counter-protesters assaulted three New York Police Department officers, including the most senior uniformed cop with almost 40 years on the force, during a protest in support of the NYPD on the Brooklyn Bridge. NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan was hospitalized with a broken finger and required stitches after a group of demonstrators attacked him and two other officers on the bridge during a ‘Stop the Violence’ protest on Wednesday. Two other cops – a lieutenant and a sergeant, according to local media – were left bleeding from minor head wounds, according to photos released by the NYPD. These are the injuries our officers sustained.pic.twitter.com/KI9wQKywHH At least 37 people were arrested during the demonstration, which was backed by NYPD union the Sergeants Benevolent Association. Video of the altercation shows a counter-protester running along the upper level of an on-ramp to the bridge and hitting the cops with a big stick as they struggled with two other protesters through a fence. It’s not clear how the skirmish began. Pro-cop protesters, including elected officials, police unions, church groups, and community leaders, marched across the bridge only to come face to face with counter-demonstrators from the Occupy City Hall protest, many of whom have been camped out in a park near City Hall (and the on-ramp to the bridge) demanding Mayor Bill de Blasio defund the NYPD to the tune of $1 billion. The city’s budget was submitted weeks ago, yet some occupiers remain in the park. Monahan, a 38-year officer from the Bronx, was actually filmed hugging protesters and ‘taking a knee’ during a protest last month in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park. However, he also spoke out against a City Council bill introduced earlier this month banning the use of diaphragm-pressing restraint holds – typically involving pressing a knee into a suspect’s back – claiming criminalizing the tactic would be “dangerous.” New York has seen a spike in crime led by a major uptick in shootings – June of 2020 was the most violent month since 1996 – exacerbated by bail reform, the coronavirus pandemic, and the devastating economic shutdowns that have plunged millions of Americans into poverty. At the same time, the police killing of black security guard George Floyd in Minneapolis in May has triggered months of sometimes-violent protests across the nation, accompanied by a steep rise in anti-cop sentiment. Monahan lamented earlier this month that “it’s tough to be a police officer now.” Pro- and anti-police demonstrators also clashed in Brooklyn over the weekend, occasionally coming to blows, and a New York Post reporter was allegedly struck in the face by a protester at Manhattan’s City Hall on Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio has drawn the ire of both sides as he refuses to make a firm commitment to backing either the police, the protesters, or the city business owners and residents caught between both – outside of cosmetic gestures like painting “ blacklivesmatter ” outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, of course.

"9 Jul, 2020",Trump hails Obama! How the US president has turned to his predecessor’s ugly methods of repressing dissent to tackle blacklivesmatter ,"The US leader has called Obama’s model for crushing the 2011 Occupy Wall St movement “beautiful” and is using it to label even peaceful blacklivesmatter protestors as domestic terrorists. It’s police state stuff. The US Constitution’s Bill of Rights makes it crystal clear in the First Amendment to the nation’s founding document, added in 1791, when it states:“Congress shall make no law … abridging … the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” How, then, to explain what happened on June 1. On that day, President Donald Trump took a bizarre stroll out of the White House and across the little pocket park known as Lafayette Square (a traditional site for protests against everything from cruelty to animals to undeclared US wars on Third World nations) for a publicity photo shoot of him awkwardly holding a Bible in front of a boarded-up historic church. But prior to that clumsy stunt, his Attorney General William Barr had ordered a brigade of armored-up National Park Police, backed by a unit of National Guard troops, to attack a bunch of peaceful, unarmed and unwarned protesters, driving them from the vicinity with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The protesters had gathered earlier in the day outside the White House, in the park and on H Street in front of the old church, to “peaceably assemble” and to “petition” and make known to the president and Congress their anger and dismay over mounting police violence against black Americans. It was, at first, hard to understand what was happening and why. Was it just that the president was afraid to have his photo shoot marred by noisy but peaceful protesters? Earlier in the day he had given a strident and intemperate speech calling for state and city officials to “dominate” the streets to shut down protests taking place across the country – most of which were peaceful – in reaction to the brutal videotaped strangulation by a knee on the neck of George Floyd. A day later, theleaked transcript of a group phone call by President Trump, his Attorney General William Barr, and his Pentagon Secretary Mark Esper, to governors of all 50 US states, made it clear what was going on. On that call, Trump recalled an earlier period of national protests called the Occupy Movement, which had seen hundreds and thousands of protesters against economic inequality and joblessness ‘occupy’ public spaces, beginning a block from Wall Street in Manhattan, NY on September 17, 2011, and quickly spreading to dozens of US cities for a period of several months into late November. A New York real estate executive based in Manhattan back then, Trump recalled to the governors how the violent, coordinated nationwide police crackdown on a wholly and conscientiously peaceful protest moment had begun. Referring first to the current uprisings led by blacklivesmatter , he said almost wistfully: “This is like Occupy Wall Street. It was a disaster until one day somebody said, ‘That’s enough.’ And they just went in and wiped them out. And it’s the last time I heard the name Occupy Wall Street… They [had] closed Wall Street, the financial district of the world! And they had total domination… Nobody did anything. And then one day somebody said, ‘That’s enough. You get them out of here within two hours.’ And it was bedlam for an hour. Then after that, everything was beautiful.” What the president described as “beautiful,” had actually been intentionally brutal, with police and mayors in 18 cities sharing advice on how to destroy the Occupy Movement in their cities – advice that included using maximum force and brutality, night raids, militarized weapons like rubber bullets, bean-bag projectiles, tear gas and pepper spray, batons, sound cannons and flash-bang grenades. The goal was to terrify the occupiers and deter them from returning after being rousted from their encampments.  It had all been coordinated and orchestrated by President Obama’s Department of Homeland Security, which had declared the peaceful protest movement to be a “potential terrorist” threat. Indeed, following Trump’s surprisingly complimentary reference to the Obama administration’s bust-up of the Occupy Wall Street encampment (perhaps the only time in four years that this president has had a good thing to say about an action of his predecessor), AG Barr spoke. He told the assembled governors of his and the administration’s intention to use the anti-terrorism approach of the “Occupy model” to spy on and then crush the current wave of urban uprisings and protests over police brutality and militarization. As Barr put it,“The structure we’re going to use is the joint terrorist task force, which I know most of you are familiar with. Tried and true system. It’s worked for domestic and homegrown terrorists, and we’re going to employ that model.” By labeling a political action or movement terrorism, the government can use what are known as Fusion Centers, which are a very opaque merging, usually in one building, of intelligence people from local and state police, and from a variety of federal intelligence and police agencies ranging from the FBI and CIA to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Cyber Command, the DEA, the Federal Police, and others, to share information with each other about activists and protest leaders. The US Justice Department can then work to build cases against those who are surveilled, with the goal of filing terror conspiracy charges against them in the hope of locking people away for years or decades. It amounts to the action of a police state. According to the National Lawyers Guild, which has been providing legal services to protesters caught up in police attacks on their demonstrations, it’s clear that this is precisely what has been happening. NLG Executive Director Pooja Gehi tells RT:“What Barr means by the ‘Occupy Model’ is a coordinated federal/state/local program to target activists and local organizers in order to charge them with serious terrorism felonies.” She notes that the NLG’s attorneys around the country, in places like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, are all hearing reports that FBI agents are“accompanying police who are knocking on people’s doors.”Pooja warns that involvement of G-Men in any questioning of suspects is dangerous because of a federal law that makes it a serious felony simply to provide false information to an FBI agent. When the right to “peaceably assemble” outside the White House to “petition the government for a redress of grievances” like rampant police brutality is so threatened, that sacred First Amendment of the Constitution starts looking pretty tattered and faded, leaving some US citizens wondering at this point if it will survive until election day on Nov. 3.

"9 Jul, 2020","Lady Antebellum, renamed ‘Lady A’ in woke PR move, sues black artist who already has the name","Tennessee country rock band Lady A – known as Lady Antebellum before officially renaming itself amid 2020’s cultural purge of references to the Confederacy – is suing a black artist with the same name in a case of peak woke irony. The band’s lawyers have targeted blues singer Anita White, who also goes by “Lady A,” suing the artist over White’s “attempt to enforce purported trademarks rights in a mark that [the band] have held for more than a decade,” the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Nashville’s District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, reads. Lady Antebellum decided to change their name to Lady A because they’re woke now, only to find out a Black artist already existed under that name so now they’re suing to use the name anyways because they couldn’t come to a deal with her. Leftist virtue signaling in a nutshell. 🤦🏻‍♂️pic.twitter.com/pPHjkkdNxh The Nashville trio had reportedly been negotiating with the singer before their talks fell through, and White has now “demanded a $10 million payment,” a statement from the band alleges. Lady Antebellum officially changed its name on June 11 following weeks of anti-racism and police brutality protests triggered by the death of George Floyd, announcing it wanted to be “more inclusive.” Antebellum refers to the time period before the US Civil War, which resulted in the abolition of slavery in the US. However, Lady Antebellum claimed the band had used the “Lady A” name as early as 2006, citing a page on its website that referred to the nickname and referencing a 2010 filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office. With no opposition to their registering the trademark for “entertainment purposes, including live musical performances and streaming musical programming” – plus later expansions into musical recordings and clothing – the band insisted its ownership of the name was uncontested. “Prior to 2020, White did not challenge, in any way, [the band’s] open, obvious, and widespread nationwide and international use of the LADY A mark as a source indicator” for its music, performances, or merchandise, the suit alleged – as if the Seattle-based blues singer would have been following the legal filings of a band on the other side of the country. White, who has released several albums as Lady A, had harsh words for the country rock band she claimed was opportunistically piggybacking off “a moment in time” represented by the blacklivesmatter protests sweeping the nation. “If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before,” she told Rolling Stone, adding “It shouldn’t have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize their name had a slave reference to it.” Lady Antebellum, because of racist connotations, changed it s name to Lady A (which still stands for Antebellum) is suing Anita White, who has gone by Lady A for over 20 years. And I am showing Anita s face, not Lady Antebellum because F that noise.https://t.co/Q0x9OPVDCbpic.twitter.com/D4LcuV7YUq While the band’s lawyers acknowledged White had performed under the name “Lady A” since at least 2010, using the name to tour and sell her music over streaming services, they pointed out that she had not trademarked the name – or if she had attempted to do so, she’d applied after Lady Antebellum had already nabbed it. However, music attorneys who spoke to Rolling Stone pointed out that White had a “common law trademark” as she’d been first to use the name in commerce. The 61-year-old singer adopted the Lady A name singing karaoke in the 1980s – long before Lady Antebellum formed in 2006 – and has performed under the name throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere under the moniker ever since. The dueling Ladies had apparently attempted to work out a legal agreement following Lady Antebellum’s name change after White called them out for allegedly stealing her name, a pact which included “continuing to share the name and supporting White’s musical career.” However, the blues singer told Newsday last month that she “no longer trust[ed]” the band, claiming “their camp is trying to erase me.” She told Rolling Stone that she had a business trademark for Lady A LLC, slamming the chart-topping country band for failing to even run a search before adopting her stage name as their own. “For them to not even reach out is pure privilege,” she said. Lady Antebellum changed its name to Lady A, “the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start,” last month amid a massive cultural backlash against references to the Confederacy that has included the pulling down of monuments and attempts to rename US military bases. Fellow country band the Dixie Chicks followed suit less than a week later, renaming itself “the Chicks” in a move that was widely mocked. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

"6 Jul, 2020",Georgia governor declares emergency & deploys National Guard as Atlanta violence skyrockets amid blacklivesmatter protests,"Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has ordered National Guard troops to deploy in Atlanta, after rioters ransacked the state police headquarters. Shootings in the city have doubled in the wake of protests against police brutality. Some 1,000 soldiers will be deployed to protect the state Capitol, the governor’s mansion, and the Department of Public Safety building that was vandalized over the weekend, Kemp announced Monday. “Peaceful protests were hijacked by criminals with a dangerous, destructive agenda. Now, innocent Georgians are being targeted, shot, and left for dead,”Kemp said.“This lawlessness must be stopped and order restored in our capital city.” This is a supervisor’s office at the command center of the@ga_dpsHQ that was vandalized this weekend. Authorities say a homemade grenade was tossed into this room, where state@RepVernonJonestells reporters he backs@GovKemp’s pledge to “track down those responsible.”#gapolpic.twitter.com/bGA4jDW4mE Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has yet to comment on the deployment. Sheannouncedon Monday afternoon that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier, however, she pleaded with the citizens to stop the violence that claimed the lives of four people over the weekend. One of them was Secoriea Turner, an 8-year-old girl. “This random wild, Wild West shoot-‘em-up because you can, has gotta stop. It has to stop,”she said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Between May 31 and June 27, some 93 people were shot in Atlanta – nearly double the number from the same time in 2019, the AJC reported. On top of the protests over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, Atlantans were also outraged by the police killing of another African-American man, Rayshard Brooks, who was found drunk and asleep in a drive-through of a Wendy’s restaurant and stole a Taser from one of the officers while resisting arrest. Protesters later torched that Wendy’s and on Saturday set up barricades around the destroyed restaurant. The child was killed when the car she was traveling in tried to get around the barricades and at least two men opened fire. Atlanta police have drastically curtailed their activities after the two officers involved in the death of Brooks were charged with murder by the local local district attorney. Governor Kemp sided with the police and demanded that Bottoms get things under control. The governor’s decision to deploy troops was“outrageous and will endanger lives,”said state senator Nikema Williams, who chairs the Georgia Democrats. She said Kemp, a Republican, was using the National Guard for the“selfish purpose”of protecting government buildings, rather than people’s lives. Think your friends would be interested?

"6 Jul, 2020",Where are the protests? Firearms overtake fireworks as shootings over July 4th weekend leave scores dead in big US cities,"The Independence Day weekend turned deadly across the US as 77 people were shot in Chicago alone, continuing a spate of violence that has plagued largely black neighborhoods amid anti-racism protests focused on police brutality. Tony Cox,a US-based journalist whose work has been published by Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. Between July 3 and July 5, 13 people were fatally shot in Chicago. The latest violence wasn’t out of character in a city that earned the nickname“Chiraq”– likening the bloodshed to that in war-torn Iraq – and where around 80 percent of homicide victims each year are black, according to police data. Father’s Day weekend last month saw 104 shootings and 14 dead. The city suffered its deadliest day in at least six decades on May 31, when 18 people were killed. Chicago had 1,384 shootings in the first six months of 2020, a 45 percent increase from the same point in 2019, according topolice figures. New York City, Atlanta, Milwaukee and other large US cities also registered a spike in violence in recent weeks. The Big Apple had 30 shootings, including 10 fatalities, on July 5 alone. NYPD responded to a 20-year high of 205 shooting incidentsin June, compared with 89 a year earlier. The carnage is taking place at the same time that activist group blacklivesmatter is leading anti-racism protests across the US, after 46-year-old black man George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. According to data compiled by theWashington Post, nine unarmed black people were shot dead by police in all of 2019, in a nation of 330 million people. Some 1,000 people are killed at the hands of US police annually, and in most cases the shootings are ruled justified. African-Americans accounted for29 percentof those deaths last year, in cases where the ethnicity of the deceased was reported. While unjustified shootings by police are tragic, civilian gun violence can be just as heartbreaking and senseless to those involved, such as the July 4 killing of an 8-year-old black girl in Atlanta.Police sayat least two men opened fire after the car in which Secoriya Williamson was riding crossed an illegal barricade that had been set up by protesters. “They say blacklivesmatter ,”said the girl’s father.“You killed your own.” Speaking at apress conferenceafter the killing, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms lamented a recent surge in black-on-black shootings. “We re doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force. We ve had over 75 shootings in the city over the past several weeks. You can t blame this on a police officer,”she said. blacklivesmatter activists have responded to reports of black-on-black violence bydenouncingthem as attempts to deflect from the“unique horror”of police brutality. One of their demands has been to defund police departments across the nation, already resulting in a $1 billion cut to the New York City police budget. Critics of the movement point to a 2016 US Department of Justice stud that found that a spike in inner-city homicides may be attributable to the“Ferguson effect”– a breakdown in trust between police and community members, that occurred after the 2014 killing of an 18-year-old black man by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

"3 Jul, 2020",The right time to defund cops? NYC gun crime hitting new heights as city culls police budget by $1bn,"Three people were murdered in New York overnight into Thursday, in line with a grim trend that saw police responding to the highest number of shootings in over 20 years last month amid a leftist push to divest from the force. The murders took place in the space of 20 minutes early on July 2, as two men were shot in the back of their heads while sitting in a parked car in the Bronx, and another man was shot in Brooklyn. Such incidents might seem like a routine night in a municipality with more than eight million residents, but they follow a disturbing trend of rising violent crime in many of the biggest American cities. Citing police sources, the New York Postreportedon Thursday that the NYPD responded to 205 shooting incidents in June, compared to the 89 incidents during the same month last year. In terms of statistics, gun violence on a somewhat bigger scale was last seen as far back as in 1996, when 236 shooting incidents were reported within the same period. However, that increase apparently did not prove to be a concern big enough for Big Apple leaders when they decided this week to cut police funding by $1 billion. The decision came amid blacklivesmatter protests across the nation, with many demanding that police departments be defunded. It’s a pretty safe bet that New York City Council members couldn’t help but hear those voices when they made their budgeting decisions since protesters have surrounded city hall much of this week. While $1 billion might seem like a ton of money, some progressives, including US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes part of the Bronx, argue that the partial defunding is no more than a drop in the bucket, while pushing for more drastic cuts. The budget move follows a decision last month to disband a 600-person unit of plainclothes police that was designed to help prevent gun violence and other crimes. NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, meanwhile, has been rallying behind the divestment from the force, announcing that the city will put the money“into the needs of our young people”instead. New York is not alone in experiencing a crime wave. Chicago, for instance, had 1,384 shootings in the first six months of this year, a 45 percent increase from the same point in 2019, police data showed. In Minneapolis, where the latest round of blacklivesmatter s protests began after 46-year-old black man George Floyd was killed on May 25 in police custody, shootings have risen 47 percent in a year to 190, according to city data. That did not stop Minneapolis City Council from voting unanimously on June 26 to abolish the city’s police department, nonetheless. The “dismantling” of the police force did not go without hiccups, however, as three of the council members later were provided with private security guards, at a taxpayer cost of $63,000 over three weeks, after receiving death threats.

"2 Jul, 2020",Crime reports in Seattle 5 TIMES higher amid ‘narcotics use & violent crime’ in CHOP zone,"Seattle saw a 525-percent spike in crime reports due to violence and turmoil within the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, according to figures released by the city’s mayor as she authorized police to clear the site. Mayor Jenny Durkan’s executive order to oust the protesters from the self-proclaimed six-block cop-free zone states the“narcotics use and violent crime, including rape, robbery, assault, and increased gang activity”since ‘CHOP’ first appeared in early June. In less than a month, the self-declared“autonomous zone”has seen two deadly shootings and a serious hike in reported incidents of crime. Two black teens, aged 16 and 19, were shot dead in separate incidents. For comparison, that’s how many were recorded in the entire Capitol Hill neighborhood in all of the previous year. “An increase of 525 percent, 22 additional incidents, in person-related crime in the area, to include two additional homicides, six additional robberies, and 16 additional aggravated assaults,”Durkan’s order says. The mayor authorized police to take back the neighborhood on Wednesday, saying that conditions in CHOP have worsened“to the point where activities in and around this area threaten public health, life, and safety.” On Wednesday morning, Seattle police reclaimed their precinct in the city’s“occupied”protest zone, arresting at least 31 people. Police Chief Carmen Best said in a statement that her officers were moving in after“weeks of violence”in and around the protest zone. “The CHOP has become lawless and brutal. Four shootings – two fatal – robberies, assaults, violence, and countless property crimes have occurred in this several block area,”Best said. Demonstrators had occupied several blocks around a park and the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct after officers abandoned the building on June 8 following clashes with protesters demanding an end to police brutality. CHOP, previously called ‘CHAZ,’ area was originally portrayed as a peaceful rally against police brutality over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May. Durkan had initially recognized the“autonomous zone”clustered around the deserted East Precinct police station, describing it as a“peaceful expression of our community’s collective grief,”and confirmation of Seattle’s“democracy.” But the city has been heavily criticized for letting the encampment prevail. A lawsuit brought by surrounding businesses accused Durkan and her administration of“enabling”the demonstrations. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"2 Jul, 2020", You go first : Rapper Zuby challenges racially prejudiced Anthony Joshua blacklivesmatter speech to invest ONLY in black businesses (VIDEO),"Rapper and fitness coach Zuby has challenged Anthony Joshua to “go first” and forfeit income from non black-owned businesses to validate his blacklivesmatter rally speech encouraging investment only in black-owned enterprise. Unified world heavyweight boxing champion Joshua recently encouraged crowds gathered at a blacklivesmatter rally in his Watford hometown to""abstain from spending your money in their [white-owned] shops and economies, and invest in black-owned businesses. Show them where it hurts”. Joshua’s involvement in the rally came as initiatives have been implemented across various sports to show solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement following the protests in the US and UK sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, such as printing the organization’s name on the back of players’ shirts in the English Premier League. Fitness author and rapper Zuby, who gained viral recognition when he decimated the British women s deadlift record while identifying as female to challenge the decision to allow biological men to compete in women’s sports, believes the message is“inherently racially prejudiced”and has challenged Joshua to make the first step by forfeiting income gained from non-black organizations. “My first question is like, ok who pays him? Right? It s like, okay, so you go first. Yeah, all your sponsorships. Let s check all these companies that sponsor you, see who runs all these boxing organizations and if they re not black people, then okay stop taking that money,”Zuby said. “You go first. It s just like, I don t know, I think you could put out a message like that if you re genuinely trying to encourage black entrepreneurship or businesses. There s a way you can put out that message, which is not inherently racially prejudiced. “If a white guy came out there and said ‘white people need to buy from white companies or not buy from black companies’, rightfully so they d be done. They’d be toast by the time they stepped off the podium. Right? So it s like, that s not a good argument. That s not a good tool to bring to the party. So let s not let s not go that way.” The message was received negatively by some sections of the media and public, who accused Joshua’s speech of including racist elements. Fellow heavyweight champ and Briton Tyson Fury claimed he, as a white man and despite hailing from an ethnic minority background, would be“crucified like Jesus Christ”had he encouraged whites not to use the services of black enterprises. WBC titleholder Fury, known as ‘The Gypsy King’, recently shared his own experiences of racial discrimination, claiming that despite being heavyweight champion of the world he is regularly the victim of epithets aimed at his Irish Traveller heritage. Zuby agrees with Fury’s stance on the speech, and has labeled the rush to intertwine sport with blacklivesmatter as“bandwagon jumping”relying heavily on trends and social pressure. READ MORE: I still get called a pikey t**t : Tyson Fury reveals he is a regular victim of RACISM for his Traveling background “I think a lot of it is bandwagon jumping. Most people want to do what is right and want to do what is decent, but a lot of it is social pressure and bandwagon jumping. If you re gonna just put blacklivesmatter on a jersey… are we targeting black people losing their lives in general? Are we talking specifically just about police stuff? What are we addressing?”he said. “And if someone just sort of answers systemic racism or institutional racism, without being any more specific than that, that s not a problem that we can like, target and fix. It needs to be more zeroed in. And then the second part of it is the sort of parlay into sports and football. I think if an individual player sort of wants to make a political statement within reason I m okay with that. “Do I think they should be forced to and this is just the position that everybody s taking, and it doesn t matter whether you re on board or not, you just got to do this. I m not a fan of that. I don t like that. I think ideally, we kind of keep politics just out of football. “Whatever the stance is, it needs to be consistent. I don t think it can just be like, okay, we’re going to do this one because it s trendy or popular right now, or this one is trending. So we ll do that. But we won t do that one. “I imagine that it was a decision sort of made from the top down and they re just like, okay, all the players are going to do this. And maybe some of them are on board, maybe most of them are on board, maybe some of them aren’t. Those who aren t obviously won t be able to say they re not. And then they ll be called racist because it s called ‘ blacklivesmatter ’. The whole thing is a mess. I think it s very intentionally set up to be like that.” Joshua’s speech came just days before the launch of the ‘Black Pound Day’ initiative in the UK, held on June 27 and scheduled to occur every month, with the objective of encouraging people to ‘buy black’ by more frequently using and booking the services of black-owned businesses. blacklivesmatter ’s introduction to sport has been met with differing reactions. In the Premier League, whereas players and clubs have seemingly unanimously accepted its featuring on their kits, a supporter of Burnley ordered a plane with a banner reading White Lives Matter attached to its tail to fly over the stadium during his team’s match away to Manchester City, purposefully timed for when the players symbolically knelt in solidarity with the movement. Zuby believes that while the debate between those for and against the movement is merely a“distraction”and largely digresses from the issues of brutality and justice that should be the focus of discussion, a number of blacklivesmatter messages can be called into question for being deliberately divisive. “This semantics between blacklivesmatter and All Lives Matter and now White Lives Matter, etc. It s all just a divisive distraction. I think a lot of it is intentional,”Zuby said.“People are arguing over the semantics of if it should be ‘ blacklivesmatter ’, or ‘All Lives Matter’? Or is ‘White Lives Matter’ offensive? The whole thing just gets dragged into the mud of stupidity. “Do you want to actually solve the problems that we have? Or do you want to just feel virtuous and scream at each other and yell at each other. And oftentimes, it seems like it s the latter rather than the former. “[ blacklivesmatter ] is a Marxist organization founded by Marxists. Where the money goes is very, very suspect. They ve got some strange goals, including wanting to defund/abolish the police, disrupt the nuclear family, blacklivesmatter UK are saying they want to dismantle capitalism, all of these things. ""This has nothing to do with the statement ‘ blacklivesmatter ’. So if someone is not on board with some of those goals, like I am not, despite the fact I obviously agree with the core statement, then it divides people up in that way. Instead of uniting people, you just end up with people bickering and fighting over nonsense.” ByDanny Armstrong RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2021.

"1 Jul, 2020","Richmond mayor demands ‘emergency’ removal of all Confederate statues on city land ahead of key council vote, citing ‘safety’","The mayor of Richmond, Virginia has ordered the removal of all Confederate statues on city land on an “emergency” basis, citing an “urgent need to protect the public” as his rationale for skipping a required council vote. Levar Stoney wasted no time after a new state law granting control of Richmond’s Confederate monuments to the city took effect on Wednesday, ordering the “immediate removal” of the monuments in a televised statement. Richmond Mayor@LevarStoneyinvokes emergency powers to order “immediate removal” of Confederate statues in the city.pic.twitter.com/FbX40yAXQz “Failure to remove the statues now poses a severe, immediate and growing threat to public safety,” Stoney proclaimed. He added that over a month of protests and “gathering in large numbers” to attempt to take down the monuments themselves puts people at risk for Covid-19 transmission – as well as statue-related accidents, like the one that nearly killed a protester in Portsmouth last month. Within an hour, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was being taken from his pedestal on the city’s Monument Avenue, to be transported to parts unknown – “temporary storage,” according to the mayor’s office. Flatbed trucks and removal equipment were also seen near other Confederate statues lining the city’s historic thoroughfare. Despite no vote today from City Council, Richmond Mayor@LevarStoneyis moving ahead with removing the Shonewall Jackson statue right now. A crane is here and neighbors are gathered to view the removal.@myVPMpic.twitter.com/LknDeQvksn While Richmond’s City Council was supposed to vote on removing the monuments on Wednesday morning, the vote was delayed until Thursday, a move Stoney apparently found unacceptable. “Today, I have the ability to do this through my emergency powers,” he told the assembled councilors. The legal process to remove a statue, passed by Virginia’s first Democratic government in decades, is supposed to take 60 days, but Stoney and several other city councilors expressed concern the monuments could hurt someone if they weren’t removed immediately. The statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis on Monument Avenue was toppled by protesters last month, though Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s effort to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee four blocks away was halted by a judge’s injunction. Northam, who granted Stoney’s initial request to declare a state of emergency when the protests began in June, extended that measure by a month on Monday without fanfare. Despite the revived fervor for toppling Confederate statues and “outing” public figures’ racist pasts, Northam’s own dalliances with blackface – immortalized in his high school yearbook – have gone largelyunremarked upon.

"1 Jul, 2020","WATCH: blacklivesmatter protesters in New York CHAZ mock cops over college education, call officer black Judas ","Tensions were high in New York’s so-called ‘City Hall Autonomous Zone’ (CHAZ) on Tuesday night, with protesters mocking cops over their education. The scenes left the demonstrators facing accusations of snobbery and privilege. Eyewitness footage shot outside City Hall in Manhattan shows protesters berating the police with a torrent of abuse, suggesting the officers are“getting paid to sit there like f**king idiots.” One man in a skirt even twerked in front of the police before launching a verbal tirade, claiming that hairdressers have to go to school for longer than police do and that cops“can t even read a f**king history book.” Protesters heckled the NYPD officers, including the dancer from above, who called the black officer a traitor to his people and a “fucking black Judas.”pic.twitter.com/uB63nIExrT The beskirted man then directed his abuse at a black officer.“Traitor, traitor to your f**king people! You re like the f**king black Judas! Selling Christ for f**king 33 cents,”he shouted while mincing back and forth before the line of cops. The incident sparked a flood of criticism of the protesters’ actions, with many accusing them of displaying an extraordinary level of arrogance.“Confirms what we already knew. College campuses imbue students with hateful, ahistorical rhetoric and then send them out into the world as smug Marxist clowns,”commentator Erielle Davidsonsaidon Twitter. This is what privilege looks like.⬇️⬇️⬇️“Half of you don’t even have a college education!”https://t.co/7QvfzWJHXP There have been repeated clashes and outbreaks of violence at New York’s so-called ‘City Hall Autonomous Zone’, or CHAZ, in honor of its namesake protest camp in Seattle, which was unceremoniously torn down by police on Wednesday morning. Eyewitness footage from the scene shows that protesters and police alike became increasingly agitated ahead of a New York City Council vote on police financing on Tuesday. The council subsequently voted to cut $1 billion from the NYPD’s $6 billion annual operations budget. Taken nearly at 5:40am this morning at#OccupyCityHallin Manhattan.

Suck my dick!”pic.twitter.com/ZDwwQAE6e4 Opponents and supporters of the vote questioned the authenticity and effectiveness of the move. Some $484 million will be cut directly, including from upcoming training budgets, while $354 million will be shifted to other areas like education and social services. The Co-Chairman of the Council’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, I. Daneek Miller, opposed the cuts, saying it made no sense when crime was rising in the city, not falling. The week-long NYC encampment was established in the last week of June and mirrored other similar protest outposts established across the US in Seattle, Portland and beyond. The New York CHAZ was established amid a backdrop of looting, outbreaks of violence, and a spike in crime including burglaries and murders. There were 38 murders in 28 days in New York City during the peak of the anti-racism protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody, twice the rate recorded during the same period in 2019. So far in 2020 there have been roughly 25 percent more murders in New York City than in the same period last year. Seattle’s CHAZ finally met its end on Wednesday, with police arresting those who refused to leave, but scenes in recent days suggest that New York City’s CHAZ is just getting started.

The mayor also called for a probe of a city council member, who allegedly leaked her private address to protesters. The city has been heavily criticized for allowing the encampment to remain in place. A lawsuit brought by nearby businesses accused Durkan and her administration of“enabling”the protesters.

"1 Jul, 2020","Beijing orders AP, CBS & other US outlets to submit information on China operations in tit-for-tat media war with US","China’s Foreign Ministry has ordered US news organizations to submit information about their operations inside the country within seven days, in what it says is a self-defense move against Washington’s restrictions on its media. The Associated Press (AP), CBS News, National Public Radio (NPR) and United Press International (UPI) media outlets are to detail information about their staff, operations and property in China. The announcement comes in response to US restrictions on Chinese media, and the measure is taken purely in self-defense, a ministry spokesperson said, according to the Global Times. “We urge the US to immediately change course, correct its error, and desist in the political suppression and unreasonable restriction of Chinese media,”said spokesman Zhao Lijian. The US State Department announced restrictions on five Chinese media outlets in February, alleging they were being used to spread propaganda. It added four others to the list in June, declaring them“foreign missions”and saying they are“effectively controlled”by the Chinese government. The targeted outlets include Global Times, People’s Daily and China Central Television. The Chinese outlets targeted by Washington are also required to report details about their employees and real estate transactions in the US. The State Department put a limit on the number of Chinese nationals the organizations could employ in March, meaning some had to fire staff members. The restrictions on employee numbers came after China said it would revoke the credentials of journalists from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post in March. Tensions between the two nations have become further inflamed amidst the coronavirus pandemic, which the US has blamed on China, and anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, which are backed by the West. The US said it was limiting the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work in March because of China’s “long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.” Chinese media has since accused the US of hypocrisy over its support for Hong Kong protests in light of its own violent response to blacklivesmatter protests sparked after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.

"30 Jun, 2020",Now it’s personal: Seattle mayor moves to dismantle CHOP after protesters show up AT HER HOUSE,"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan sent heavy machinery to remove concrete barricades around the CHOP ‘autonomous zone’ and called for a probe of a council member, after protesters showed up outside her residence. Under the cover of rain on Tuesday, vehicles operated by city workers removed the barricades set up around the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP, formerly known as CHAZ), an area spanning several blocks of downtown Seattle under control of protesters – including blacklivesmatter , Antifa and anarchists – since early June. #BREAKING: Seattle Police just showed here at#CHOPwith SDOT.

Protestors moving everything they can from the area to re-block off 10th and E.

Critics of CHOP had also been opposed, saying the city was basically aiding and abetting the rioters. Mayor Durkan had initially approved of the“autonomous zone”centered around the abandoned East Precinct police station, calling it a“summer of love”and proof of Seattle’s“democracy.”Then two African-American men were killed, and two more critically injured, in a series of shootings a week apart. The proverbial last straw, however, seems to have been the appearance of protesters outside of Durkan’s residence. Noting that her address has been kept confidential since she was a US attorney in Seattle during the Obama administration, Durkan accused the protesters of putting“families and children at risk."" The stunt led the mayor to denounce Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a socialist who has joined forces with the protesters. Durkan has now asked the council to investigate Sawant over allowing protesters into City Hall earlier this month, encouraging the occupation of the East Precinct to begin with, and finally leading the protesters to Durkan’s residence. #BREAKING- Mayor Durkan urges Council to investigate Kshama Sawantpic.twitter.com/6P73jPDb70 Sawant responded by admitting that she“marched, rallied, and organized”with the local community – including her office staff – in the name of racial, environmental and economic justice, accusing Durkan of having“utterly failed working people and communities of color in this city.” She further accused the mayor of being a“corporate politician desperately looking to distract from her failures of leadership and politically bankrupt administration,”having once been a progressive ally. Sawant echoed the demands of the protesters to reverse“racist gentrification,”de-fund the city police, and fund the Green New Deal instead. Just remember: As Durkan calls out Sawant, as Sawant calls out Durkan, as Sawant and Gonzalez deflect blame for violence in#CHOP, as the city tells people to leave CHOP but doesn t make them ...... nothing is getting done. CHOP/CHAZ was initially described as a peaceful protest against police brutality over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. It has resulted in two homicides in under a month so far; that’s how many were recorded in the entire Capitol Hill neighborhood in all of 2019. Seattle councilmembers say we should reject any claim#CHOPplays a role in the recent violence seen on Capitol Hill.

"30 Jun, 2020",Self-hatred is so RAMPANT in the West that politicians are now even denying cold hard facts,"Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf reeled off a list of positions in Scottish public life, all held by white people. But he conspicuously failed to mention that Scotland is 96 percent white, as it didn’t fit the narrative. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall A strange and confusing scene befell the Scottish Parliament earlier this month. Like most people on the planet (and indeed in Scotland), the incident passed me by at the time, but it came to my attention after footage began circulating on social media. The clip in question features the Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf reeling off a list of positions in the Scottish legal profession and law enforcement, and then saying – or more accurately, spitting – the word “white” after them. You might think he was describing the colour of tiling they had all opted for in their bathrooms. But no, Mr Yousaf was pointing out the melanin levels of these senior lawyers, judges and policemen. Once he was done with his own purview of law, he moved on to other areas such as medicine (white), trade unions (white), and directors general of the Scottish government (you’ve guessed it, white). When he reached the end of his little list he added “that is not good enough.” Mr Yousaf, who is not white, then decided he would talk directly to his pastier constituents and said:“As people of colour, we don’t need your gestures. Don’t just tweet blacklivesmatter . Don’t just post a hashtag. Don’t just take the knee. Don’t just tell us how you’re not a racist – I take that as a bare minimum. You must be anti-racist.” Scotland is 96.5% White. Make what you will of his delivery.#HumzaYousaf#Racisim#Scotlandpic.twitter.com/QCqvrcf2Cs You can judge for yourself Mr Yousaf’s tone while he is pointing out the skin colour of his colleagues in the clip above. Whatever your assessment of the Scottish justice secretary’s impromptu ethnic survey of public life in Scotland, he failed to mention one (I would argue, rather important) fact: Scotland is more than 96 percent white. Yes, from Hadrian’s Wall to the Shetland Islands, less than four percent of Scotland’s inhabitants are anything other than white. This is not a criticism of the country; it is a fact, just as it is that less than one percent of Scotland is black – which might go some way towards explaining why it hasn’t as yet had a black high court judge or chief constable. What makes Mr Yousaf’s statement truly perplexing, though, is that here we have a senior member of the Scottish Nationalist Party and Scottish Government apparently complaining that Scotland is full of native Scots. His speech took place as part of a broader debate held in the Scottish Parliament on racism in Scottish society, although “debate” is an odd word for a situation where no one put forward a contrary opinion. For two hours, the entire Scottish Parliament – Tory, Labour, SNP, Lib Dem and Green MSPs alike – reeled off reasons why Scotland was an awful, xenophobic and systemically racist country. When they weren’t discussing their own failings, they took the opportunity to make “orange man bad” observations about the state of the USA. Now, I’m not Scottish. But if I were, it would peeve me somewhat to see my national parliament indulging in self-flagellation just so its members could flaunt their virtue. It will also be interesting to see how much time they devote to discussing theknife attackthat occurred in Glasgow at the end of last week, seeing as they devoted over two hours of parliamentary time to a crime that happened 4,000 miles away and involved precisely zero Scotsmen. The whole display struck me as a perfect microcosm for the wave of societal self-hatred sweeping across the West at the moment. The populations of the freest and most prosperous societies to ever grace the face of the Earth are currently in the grip of a spasm of irrationality that has caused them to see their own countries as evil. We have spent the entire month of June berating ourselves for being riddled with racism, bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia and God knows what else. We have literally torn down national heroes or boarded them up because we’ve now decided they were bad people. We have exclusively focused on bad things in our history, despite the fact that those sins are universal, committed by every culture in history. No credence has been given to the achievements of Western civilisation; the fact it was the first society in history to attempt to abolish slavery on a global scale has been deemed irrelevant. The fact that most of the world’s functioning democracies were born out of this history is ignored. That Western Europe and North America are observably the best places to live if you are a minority of any description is discounted. The West is behaving like an angry, depressed, self-loathing teenager. What these protests and parliamentary debates point to is a victory of narrative over facts. The progressive neo-Marxist left has managed to gain control of the narrative, and as a result all we hear are people, places and corporations flinging their support behind causes they do not understand. Would a corporation acting rationally willingly throw its support and plough millions of dollars into the coffers of an organisation that is committed to the “overthrow of capitalism”? No, but they have, for that is what the organisation blacklivesmatter is committed to. But these are facts, not narrative, so they are ignored. Would an organisation allegedly committed to saving the lives of black people focus solely on avery small subsetof black deaths? No, but again, the fact thathomicide is the leading cause of deathfor black men under 44 years of age in the United States and those killings are overwhelmingly committed by members of that same group doesn’t fit the narrative. Therefore, it is ignored. This is exactly the case with Humza Yousaf’s rant about the lack of BAME people in high-profile roles in Scottish life. The reason most of the top jobs in Scotland are held by white people is because Scotland is made up overwhelmingly of white people. But it doesn’t fit the narrative, so it is ignored. We need to start talking about facts, not feelings, before we tear everything down just because we are angry. Anger has ripped down many things; rarely has it built anything to replace them.

"26 Jun, 2020",Journalist locked out of Twitter for sharing Reading attack video says he has evidence UK government DEMANDED his censorship,"British-born journalist Raheem Kassam says the UK government is the reason he was locked out of his Twitter account for sharing a video of last week’s terrorist attack in Reading, when a Libyan asylum-seeker stabbed three people. “I have evidence that the British government demanded Twitter suspend my account,”Kassam said on the social network Parler on Thursday, two days after his Twitter account was locked. He has not made the evidence public yet, however. A Breitbart alum, Kassam is currently the editor of the online outlet National Pulse and a co-host of the podcast War Room with Steve Bannon, former adviser to US President Donald Trump. His Twitter account shows no activity after June 23. National Pulseshared a screenshotof Twitter’s message to Kassam in which the platform informs him he was locked for a June 20 tweet of the attack in Reading. According to Twitter, one is not allowed to“post content of deceased individuals or moments in which they die with intent to abuse, or if the media is excessively gory.” A 25-year old man, later identified as a Libyan asylum-seeker, went on a stabbing spree, killing three people and seriously injuring three more. Kassam shared a video of the attack, with the note it was“GRAPHIC”and said it took place“in vicinity of a blacklivesmatter protest.”Both that tweet and the video have since been scrubbed from Twitter. Kassam told National Pulse that he made a decision to share“serious breaking news that would aid the public during a terror attack in England.” “This is the same thought people had when they shared the George Floyd video,”Kassam added, referring to the death of the African-American man in Minnesota last month that sparked weeks of protests, often violent, in the US.“They wanted people to know the truth and tweeted it. But for some reason, the Floyd death remains up on twitter but the deaths of three white men at the hands of a Libyan asylum seeker must come down? People can draw their own conclusions.” Twitter has invoked some rather obscure rules of late, classifying President Donald Trump’s warnings to rioters as a“glorification of violence”and“threat of harm against an identifiable group.”The president’s favorite meme-maker was also banned over too many copyright complaints, though Twitter refused to say how many were too many. Outraged conservatives have been migrating to the rival platform Parler in droves. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"25 Jun, 2020","Occupy meets blacklivesmatter : Protesters camp outside New York’s City Hall, demanding $1bn cut from NYPD budget","Hundreds of protesters have been camped out in front of New York’s City Hall for the past two nights, vowing to “occupy” it until Mayor Bill de Blasio agrees to cut $1 billion from the police budget and give it to social services. The demonstrators set up camp in a park adjacent to City Hall on Tuesday evening and were still there as of Thursday afternoon, pledging to occupy the space until a sixth of the New York Police Department’s $6-billion budget is slashed. The money should be redistributed to community and social services, as well as healthcare and education, they say. The group’s demands have support from New York’s City Council, which has also proposed a $1 billion cut to the NYPD budget. However, de Blasio has balked at the sum, despite agreeing weeks ago to cut an unspecified amount from the agency budget and to reinvest it in social programs. Happening Now at#OccupyCityHall, Wimson, member-leader of@nychangeand@housing4allNYholding a#CancelRentteach-in!#HomelessCantStayHome#EndHomelessnesspic.twitter.com/XoPl8vULpR Organized by VOCAL-NY, a progressive advocacy group focused on ending mass incarceration, the AIDS epidemic, and the war on drugs, the demonstration isn’t exactly settling in for the long haul. The city’s budget is due on June 30, meaning they have only another five nights of camping ahead of them at the most. But the activists are making the most of it, putting up banners, holding teach-ins, and leading chant after chant. blacklivesmatter protesters have raised calls to defund the police across the country, amid massive nationwide protests against police brutality. Sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the demonstrations have been marked by a heavy-handed police response and occasional outbreaks of mob violence, raising tensions in communities already battered by the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently threatened city bars and restaurants with punitive measures over their apparent failure to enforce social distancing and mask rules on their patrons, coronavirus regulations don’t appear to apply to the City Hall encampment. The authorities, eager to lock down local playgrounds and harass parents for fear of children spreading Covid-19, have taken the opposite approach to the street-packing protests, allowing the decidedly un-social-distanced demonstrations to continue without interference – a double standard that has puzzled and enraged many New Yorkers. Cuomo has passed several police-reform measures, officially banning the type of chokehold that killed Eric Garner in 2014, repealing a statute that kept police disciplinary records private, requiring cops to report gun discharges within six hours, and designating an independent prosecutor to investigate killings of unarmed civilians by police. However, many activists criticize the moves as being too little, too late, pointing out that Cuomo previously stood in the way of the same reforms he now champions. Meanwhile, police have complained that both the new laws and the suggested budget cuts will make it impossible for them to keep New York safe. The NYPD has recorded 125 shootings already in June – the highest for the month since 1996, and Commissioner Dermot Shea blames bail reform and the pandemic’s impact on the criminal justice system for allowing dangerous individuals to walk the streets unimpeded.

"19 Jun, 2020","Trump warns ‘protesters, anarchists & agitators’ they face a ‘much different scene’ at his Oklahoma rally","President Donald Trump has warned any “protesters, anarchists” and “agitators” who show up at his Oklahoma rally that they’ll be met with a very different response than police have shown during the George Floyd protests elsewhere. Trump, who is due to hold his first political rally since the beginning of the pandemic on June 20, tweeted on Friday that“any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes”who head to the Oklahoma venue will be treated differently than they have been“in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis.” Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene! New York’s police and mayor have been criticized over their handling of looting which broke out in the city during blacklivesmatter protests, while a group of anarchists blocked off an area in Seattle which they proclaimed as police-free. Minneapolis City Council has moved to disband its police department in response to the death of George Floyd in custody there last month – an event which ignited the current wave of protests. The president’s handling of the protest movement and its underlying grievances about police brutality and systemic racism has been under intense public scrutiny for weeks. At one point, a crowd of peaceful protesters were dispersed by police near the White House, apparently to clear a path for Trump to visit a nearby church for a photo op. Later, Trump was criticized on social media and by some mainstream media outlets when he was mistakenly perceived to have said that George Floyd was looking down from heaven in appreciation of falling US unemployment rates. Friday’s tweet from Trump ahead of the rally provoked contrasting responses on social media, with some approving of his“Law and Order”approach to dealing with potential troublemakers. Others took his words as an attack on free speech, interpreting Trump’s message as“threatening violence against peaceful protestors.” The Law and Order President does not screw around when it comes to America’s safety! The iron fist of justice will be there in OK to greet violent criminals pretending to be ""protestors"".Another reason that a Trump Rally is the safest place in Earth!#MAGA So you’re threatening violence against peaceful protestors. Got it. Protesters? You re threatening violence against people exercising their FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH? Some users even pointed out another controversy around holding a huge public gathering: the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. ...oh, and also please sign the waiver that if you get Coronavirus, Trump and the Trump campaign are not responsible. The Tulsa rally was rescheduled from its original date of June 19 due to an earlier public outcry over its historical associations. The date is commemorated for the day in 1865 when Texas became the last Confederate state to comply with President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation to end slavery. Tulsa was the site of a massacre in 1921, when hundreds of black residents were killed by white locals. The decision to have a rally on June 19 in Tulsa has been seen by some as sending a cryptic anti-black message. Trump’s warning tweet follows the rise of a nationwide protest movement sparked by the death of Floyd, an African American man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee onto his neck for around eight minutes. The subsequent massive marches against police brutality and racism have been largely peaceful, but some turned violent with protesters clashing with cops, and looting breaking out in some cities.

"19 Jun, 2020","BoJo says focus less on ‘symbols,’ more on ‘substance’ of racism, as English rugby mulls banning song penned by freed black slave","British PM Boris Johnson says he wouldn’t want to see fans banned from singing the England rugby union anthem ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’, and that people should focus more on the substance and less on the symbols of racism. During an interview with Sky News on Friday, Johnson was asked whether he had“strong views”on ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’ – the iconic song bellowed out by English rugby union fans at stadiums. The anthem is currently being reviewed by the Rugby Football Union due to its links to slavery. Johnson said he was against“any sort of prohibition on singing”the song and insisted that the removal of offensive symbols such as statues, seen in many places over the last few weeks, was not the answer to rooting out racism in Britain. The prime minister stated that people needed to“focus less on the symbols of discrimination”and more on“the substance of the issue.” PM Boris Johnson is asked if he has ""strong views"" on the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot .He says people should focus ""less on the symbols of discrimination"" and more ""on the substance of the issue.""More here:https://t.co/1c9kEYG7v1pic.twitter.com/brKSpBNt8N The lyrics to ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,’ written in the second half of the 19th century by Wallis Willis, a freed black slave in what is now Choctaw County in Oklahoma, originally had nothing to do with rugby or any sports at all. A political storm around the rights and wrongs of tearing down statues of figures linked to slavery or racist policies has swept Britain, prompted by the downing of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston’s monument in Bristol in early June. “Topple the Racists”– a website run by the“Stop Trump Coalition”with support from the“ blacklivesmatter ”campaign – was launched soon after, with the objective to“take down statues and monuments in the UK that celebrate slavery and racism.” The group provided a map with the locations of the offending monuments to be toppled, including that of a former PM who oversaw the abolition of slavery. It was shared by British Guardian journalist Owen Jones, who was roundly ridiculed by critics on social media for doing so. The fierce debate on racist symbols in Britain comes against a backdrop of anti-racism protests around the world, provoked by the brutal killing of 46-year-old African American George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis in May. The protests – led by the blacklivesmatter movement – have faced counter demonstrations by right-wing groups in Britain, who say they want to defend historic statues such as that of Winston Churchill – which was defaced by anti-racism activists in London.

"19 Jun, 2020",Elites who appease the baying mob’s apology addiction have stripped apology of all meaning,"No sooner did Jacob Frey, the Mayor of Minneapolis, apologize to the black community for the killing of George Floyd than everyone felt they had to say sorry for the sins of their fathers, erasing the meaning of sincere apology. is an author and social commentator. He is an emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent in Canterbury. Author ofHow Fear Works: The Culture of Fear in the 21st Century.Follow him on Twitter@Furedibyte is an author and social commentator. He is an emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent in Canterbury. Author ofHow Fear Works: The Culture of Fear in the 21st Century.Follow him on Twitter@Furedibyte I’ve stopped counting the number of apologies issued by public figures, business institutions and celebrities in recent weeks. It’s sometimes difficult to avoid the conclusion that a public apology has become a public-relations exercise. Why else would the Greene King pub chain and Lloyd’s of London apologize for the links to the slave trade – a historical event that occurred centuries ago? Moral cowardice is another of the driving forces fueling the proliferation of public apologies. Apology has become weaponized to the point that very few politicians possess the strength of character to stand by their words. I remember when, last November, the Mayor of Middlesbrough, Andy Preston, apologized ‘unreservedly’ to the mental-health charity Mind for calling a Facebook commenter a ‘nutter’. There’s something truly scary about a world in which people wish to censor others for using a word the vast majority of human beings find unobjectionable. But what is even more chilling is that the mayor felt obliged to grovel and apologize. The elites’ addiction to apology has been evident since the 1990s. During that decade, the then US president, Bill Clinton, publicly apologized to his nation’s black community for slavery. Meanwhile, the former British prime minister Tony Blair turned public apology into a veritable art form. He took it upon himself to apologize for Britain’s role in the slave trade. He also issued an apology in 1997 for his nation’s responsibility for the Irish potato famine of the 19thcentury. It is evident that Western political elites are far better at apologizing for the ‘bad old days’ than inspiring the public about their nation’s past – or even present. Since the outbreak of the present wave of blacklivesmatter protests, the issuing of a public apology has become almost a routine response to the mere hint that you should take the knee and grovel. Typically, whenever an individual is called out and denounced for their language, an apology swiftly follows. But in the current climate, there can be no ‘mistakes’, because your words will come back to bite you. Just about any gesture or statement can be branded as not just insensitive but racist. Poor Karol G, the Colombian reggaeton singer, who, in response to the protest following George Floyd’s death, tweeted a now-deleted picture of her black-and-white coated dog with the caption ‘The perfect example that Black and White TOGETHER look beautiful’, along with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. After she was denounced and ridiculed, she issued an immediate statement of apology.“I want to make clear that my intentions were right in the photo I posted earlier. I meant to say that racism is terrible and that I cannot begin to understand it,”shepleaded. As Rachel Yang wrote recently on the arts website Entertainment Weekly, ‘2020 has turned out to be an unpredictable year, to say the least, but one thing we can always count on is celebrities needing to issue apologies for theirbehavior’. Experience shows that often an apology is not enough, as if those who demand them get ever more high in their addiction to humiliation and, enjoying it, seek to up the dose. Take the case of LA Galaxy football player Aleksandar Katai. His club forced him to issue an apology, not for anything that he did, but because his wife Tea posted a statement calling protestors“disgusting cattle”! Poor Katai took the knee and pledged that both he and his family would“take the necessary actions to learn, understand, listen, and support the black community.”However, not even this act of self-abasement helped him. He was dropped from the squad because of a statement made by his wife. Western society’s addiction to public apology is a reflection of the fact that its political and cultural elite does not believe in itself – or at least it has no idea what to believe in. The speed with which individuals apologize for a statement they made a few hours before exposes both their lack of firm conviction and their moral cowardice. When an apology is a response to a very public ultimatum, it’s almost never a genuine act of reflection and contrition. Rather, it has become an empty ritual that denudes their apology of meaning. As I write these lines, the UK’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is facing calls to apologize for stating that taking the knee is a gesture copied from the TV drama ‘Game of Thrones’. He added that he would take the knee for only two people: ‘the Queen and the Mrs, when I asked her to marryme’. After an outburst of criticism, Raab tried to soothe the mob baying for his blood by indicating that he has“full respect for blacklivesmatter campaigners,”but didn’t issue the now-mandatory apology. It took just a few minutes for the all too readily offended Twitterati to pile in to demand an apology. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, led the way with a post on Twitter demanding that Raab issue a ‘fulsome apology’. Davey knows a thing or two about the meaningless issuing of an apology. Last June, he apologized for writing that his electoral strategy was to“decapitate that blond head,”referring to PM Boris Johnson. Back in 1976, Elton John released a song titled ‘Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word’. A song titled ‘The Hardest Word Not to Say is Sorry’ would be altogether more fitting for the 2020s.

"19 Jun, 2020",US Chick-Fil-A’s CEO takes knee & shines shoes of black rapper to win pardon for whites’ ‘shameful oblivion’,"Dan Cathy, CEO of the Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant chain, publicly polished the sneakers of the black rapper Lecrae. The son of the Chick-Fil-A founder said he did it to recognize white people’s “oblivion” to racial injustice. “Most of us white people, we’re out-of-sight, out-of-mind oblivious to it,”Dan Cathy said. Kneeling at the feet of the Christian rapper during a panel discussion at the Passion City Church in Atlanta, Georgia, the CEO then started to polish the artist’s shoes. “If we...find somebody that needs to have their shoes shined, we just need to go over and shine their shoes.” Shoes or sneakers, it doesn’t matter, according to Cathy, who claimed any personal touch would do, and afterwards, moved to hug the rapper. Explaining his anti-racism stance, Cathy said,“Our silence is so huge at this time. We cannot be silent.” He called on white Americans to recognize“the level of frustration and exasperation, and almost the sense of hopelessness that exists within the African American community”. The CEO admitted that there were“conscious and unconscious biases”within his corporation, and some Caucasian staff who made their black“brothers and sisters”feel they weren’t being treated with honor, dignity, and respect. Cathy is not unique in his self-humbling attempt to earn the sympathy of the black community. In addition to those taking a knee in solidarity with the protests against police brutality, there have beenexamplesof white residents and police officers washing the feet of their black neighbors. A number of white-owned businesses in the US have also proffered an apology for their racist practices in the past, though concerns have been raised as to whether all of them were sincere or had just attempted to capitalize on the situation. About a dozen Chick-Fil-A outlets have been attacked during the unrest that followed the police killings of George Floyd in May and Rayshard Brooks in June. Cathy reacted immediately, tweeting apologies to his company’s black staff“who are suffering because of racism”. In the past, Chick-Fil-A has come under fire for its owners’ record on LGBT issues. In 2012, Cathy criticized same-sex marriage and donated funds to groups that opposed it. From 2019 onwards, he has no longer made any such donations. Think your friends would be interested?

I think it’s a distraction from the larger movement, and the movement is justice for black people,”Wheeler said, voicing concerns over reports from Seattle about armed protesters and the extortion of local businesses. Portland Mayor@tedwheelerwas in the Pearl District this morning after PPB cleared an area that protesters had deemed an autonomous zone. Wheeler was asked if he d support such an area being established in the city, here is his response#LiveOnK2pic.twitter.com/zGRKVeJvqI The decision to create the autonomous zone came after the Portland City Council approved a new budget that slashes about $16 million from the Police Bureau s funding. The move failed to appease the protesters, however, who had called for a whopping $50 million cut. On the night the blockade was erected, 27-year-old Anthony Eaglehorse-Lassandro drove his car into a group of protesters, injuring three people. Police say they later tracked down the driver, who’s been accused of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, though his motive still remains unclear. Elsewhere in the US, protesters have tried to establish similar autonomous zones, hoping to follow in the footsteps of a loose band of anarchists and blacklivesmatter activists in Seattle, who’ve occupied a six-block area since early June. The enclave – now ‘officially’ dubbed the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, or CHOP – surrounds the Seattle Police Department s East Precinct, which was abandoned under orders from city administration amid the ongoing demonstrations. So far, Seattle officials have shown little willingness to kick the protesters out, despite complaints from the police that the CHOP has interfered with their work. The US has been gripped by a wave of demonstrations and civil unrest since the death of George Floyd, an African American man killed at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May. Protesters first took to the streets after seeing disturbing footage of Floyd’s last moments alive, pinned to the ground under an officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes. The protests have spiraled out of control in some cities, seeing indiscriminate rioting and looting. Starting with calls for police reform, the protesters’ demands have quickly grown. While the officer who killed Floyd is now on trial for second-degree murder and President Donald Trump has rolled out an executive order discouraging police chokeholds, calls to defund and outright abolish police departments have only gained momentum. Trump, however, has made it clear that such proposals are out of the question, instead calling to increase police resources around the country. Think your friends would be interested?

"16 Jun, 2020","NBC colludes with UK thought police to get ZeroHedge & Federalist deplatformed from Google Ads, smear them as ‘far-right’","Google has threatened to drop ZeroHedge and the Federalist from its ad platform after NBC and a UK ‘cyber-hate’ watchdog denounced the outlets for allegedly publishing “fake news” about the ongoing George Floyd protests. After initially reporting that Google had “removed both sites’ ability to monetize” via Google Ads after they were found in violation of the platform’s rules regarding race-related speech on Tuesday, NBC quietly stealth-updated itsarticleto reflect that the tech behemoth had banned ZeroHedge last week and had merely notified the Federalist of outstanding violations. The Federalist supposedly has three days to remedy the offending content – which is apparently located in the comments section, not its articles. Will a single American MSM outlet have the integrity to say ‘We don’t agree with@FDRLST&@zerohedge, but we’re alarmed when news sites lose livelihoods because of anti-free speech activists colluding with corporate censors’?https://t.co/PPWBPfceZW NBC nevertheless patted itself on the back for a job well done, bragging that its “News Verification Unit” notified Google of“research conducted by the Center for Countering Digital Hate,”a UK outfit that lobbies social media platforms to censor“wrongthink”perpetrators. The CCDH runs a“Stop Funding Fake News”campaign, attempting to guilt brands that have made statements in support of blacklivesmatter into pulling their ads from platforms that publish stories that don’t fit the accepted narrative about the movement. As part of that effort, the CCDH singled out 10 US-based websites, claiming not only had they published“racist articles”about the George Floyd protests against racism and police brutality, but that they would make“millions of dollars”off the offending articles through Google Ads. Google confirmed the Federalist was never actually demonetized in a tweet after NBC updated its article. However, the original version of NBC’s article cited a Google spokesperson clearly stating“we’ve removed both sites’ ability to monetize with Google,”explaining that both sites“violated its policies on content related to race.” We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comments section. In its self-congratulatory write-up, NBC took care to avoid describing either outlet’s transgressions in detail, instead explaining that both had“become well known in recent years for publishing far-right articles on a variety of subjects”– a blanket condemnation readers of both outlets would no doubt contest. Without linking to the offending articles, the network accused ZeroHedge of“claiming that protests were fake”in one article and claimed the Federalist had“published an article claiming the media had been lying about looting and violence during the protests.” While it’s impossible to tell without a link, the Federalist specificallycalled outNBC for directing its reporters not to use the word“riot”to describe the violent unrest unfolding in Minneapolis in the days following George Floyd’s killing – an act which might have triggered the network’s wrath. The deplatforming raised more than a few eyebrows on social media as commenters wondered when it became acceptable journalistic practice to rat out one’s competitors for insufficient wokeness. A leftwing activist masquerading as a NBC journalist helped bully@Googleinto pulling ad revenue from The Federalist because they criticized a political movement they disagree with.Big Tech & the MSM are working together to shutdown all dissentpic.twitter.com/a6ziAN84lq The two British NBC ""journalists"" who pressured Google to ban ZeroHedge & Federalist from its ad platform bragged about conspiring with British-based SPLC-style witch hunt groups@SFFakeNews@CCDHate. This is foreign interference.https://t.co/SeezGQBijC Some questioned when Google had begun demonetizing sites over the content of their comment sections – a policy that would seem to fly in the face of Section 230 protections, which don’t only apply to giant tech platforms. Section 230 is supposed to be all about not punishing websites for their comment sections. Google will deserve every regulation thrown their way if they actually start demonetizing over comment sections.https://t.co/K3DNEkrfBk A handful of threats ominously suggested the Daily Caller was“next.” You’re next, lying hack. The conservative outlet filmed andreported onWashington DC rioters’ attack on an NBC news crew just after midnight on June 3 – something the channel itself conspicuously avoided doing, going out of its way to avoid mentioning the violent interruption to what was otherwise reportedly a peaceful night.

"16 Jun, 2020",Millions mistakenly raised for unaffiliated blacklivesmatter Foundation that wants to work with police,"Amid multiple high-profile police shootings in recent years, millions of dollars were raised for “The blacklivesmatter Foundation,” but the charity is unaffiliated with and diametrically opposed to the movement of the same name. The foundation is a Santa Clarita, California–based charitable organization, which lists a UPS store as its address. It was founded by Robert Ray Barnes, a 67-year-old LA music producer, in May 2015. It is among the first verified organizations that appears when users search for“ blacklivesmatter ”on GoFundMe, so many people did not perform due diligence when donating. They included employees from Apple, Google, and Microsoft who raised millions of dollars for the foundation but stopped just short of making actual donations after the bizarre situation came to light. Rough estimates indicate that somewhere in the region of $4.35 million was raised for the blacklivesmatter Foundation in the first weeks of June, but the majority of it was frozen before it could be released. Apparently, even GoFundMe was unaware of the lack of affiliation, which only came to light following media enquiries. Howdy everyone. One of the cool benefits I get for working at Microsoft is that they match up to $15k in my donations. So every dollar I get on stream we’ll be doubled to a charity. I’ve narrowed it down to these 6 ✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿pic.twitter.com/ke5sQXpekh The blacklivesmatter movement evolved from the 2013 hashtag spawned in the wake of the Treyvon Martin case. In recent weeks, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department, the blacklivesmatter movement has called for the police to be defunded and the money to be redirected to help black communities. The blacklivesmatter Foundation, however, claims to be working towards“bringing the community and police closer together.” “I don’t have anything to do with the blacklivesmatter Global Network. I never met them; never spoke to them. I don’t know them; I have no relationship with them,”Barnes said.“Our whole thing is having unity with the police department.” Meanwhile, the blacklivesmatter movement, officially called“ blacklivesmatter Global Network Foundation, Inc.,”which was registered in the state of Delaware in 2017, two years after Barnes registered in California, is claiming that he has co-opted the brand. “The Santa Clarita group is improperly using our name,”a blacklivesmatter spokesperson said.“We intend to call them out and follow up.” Further complicating matters is the fact that the official movement is not a nonprofit, but instead raises funds through a charity called Thousand Currents. Well-intentioned people repeatedly conflate the foundation with the movement and Barnes has reaped the rewards, gathering donations made via GoFundMe, PayPal or employee donation-matching platforms. “They took my name and put this ‘Inc.’ behind it,”Barnes said.“They took my name. I own that name. I haven’t stolen anything from them. They have stolen from me. They have lied and been able to profit using my name.” Barnes has declined to reveal how much money he has raised, though tax filings from 2017 show that the foundation had raised at least $300,000 in donations. Barnes reportedly hasn’t done anything with the funds but is working on“prototypes”for community and police bonding, including“Community Organized Programs”or“COP events,”referring to annual buffet dinners and other social events aimed at bringing the community closer together with its police force. “We don’t want to be enemies of the police. We will let the movement do that,”Barnes added.“We want to get to the point where we have programs and that’s where the change will happen. That’s where we come in.” In yet another odd twist in the tale, Santa Clarita doesn’t have its own police department, relying instead on LA County police protection, and authorities there say they have never heard of Barnes or his foundation.

"15 Jun, 2020","Don’t ask, don’t tell? NYC mayor directs contact tracers not to question people about attending blacklivesmatter protests","The army of contact tracers hired by New York City to conduct the ‘test and trace’ campaign to weed out coronavirus infection vectors will reportedly not be allowed to ask people if they attended blacklivesmatter protests. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on May 8 that NYC would be hiring hundreds of Covid-19 contact tracers to help bring the coronavirus, which wreaked havoc on the densely-populated city’s population, to heel. The city has witnessed 210,000 cases resulting in at least 17,193 deaths from the infection. However, before May came to an end, George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, sparking a wave of outrage and widespread protest across the US and beyond. In the aftermath, which has seen major protests marred by rioting and looting as well as outbreaks of violence between citizens and the police in New York City, authorities have opted not to ask people who test positive for Covid-19 whether they recently attended blacklivesmatter protests. “No person will be asked proactively if they attended a protest,”Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the de Blasio administration said. Instead, participants will be asked to“recall ‘contacts’ and individuals they may have exposed,”or people with whom they have had close contact of within six feet for at least 10 minutes. “If a person wants to proactively offer that information [about attending protests], there is an opportunity for them to do so,”Cohen added. The move has drawn harsh criticism from some quarters, with many on social media complaining that it completely undermines the point of contact tracing. This is purely political nonsense now. What’s the point of contact tracing if you don’t disclose where you’ve been? You had one job!https://t.co/u7FPpZpTuF In the interim, de Blasio promised to release figures at some point on Monday regarding the numbers of people questioned so far. “That’s the one variable in this equation that we’re not sure of: We don’t know what the effect of those protests are,”New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said when asked about the potential for the blacklivesmatter protests to trigger another wave of coronavirus infection. The three-day average percentage of positive tests from New Yorkers has dropped from 69 percent on March 31 to roughly two percent as of June 8, however the data is skewed by the fact that the testing pool has been greatly expanded, and now includes asymptomatic people. City and state authorities are treading carefully, advising people who attended the protests to get tested but avoiding any attempts to dissuade or criticize them for fear of provoking condemnation or even violence. The mayor’s own daughter was also arrested during a Manhattan protest. Previously, Chair of New York City Council Health Committee Mark D Levine said that, were there to be another spike of coronavirus in the city, which is among the hardest-hit in the country, racism would be to blame, not people disregarding social distancing norms.

"14 Jun, 2020",‘Pandering didn t save you’: blacklivesmatter -supporting Wendy s gets Twitter-roasted after mob torches Atlanta restaurant,"Social media users have unleashed a torrent of mockery upon Wendy s and its support for blacklivesmatter , after one of its restaurants in Atlanta was burnt to the ground following the fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks. The fast food restaurant was targeted by a furious mob hours after police gunned down Brooks, who resisted arrest and attempted to flee after being suspected of drunk driving. Wendy s employees reportedly called the police after Brooks passed out at the wheel while waiting in the drive-thru line. Within hours of the shooting, protesters broke the restaurant s windows and set fire to the building. The rioting prompted some on Twitter to chide the fast food company for expressing solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement earlier this month.“How s that sucking up working out for you?”asked conservative YouTuber Mark Dice, replying to the June 4 tweet. They just burnt down your restaurant in Atlanta. How s the sucking up working out for you?https://t.co/LqzoOquVMV Others expressed similar contempt for the chain s attempt to appease the“leftist rage mob.” Yet your pandering didn’t save you from the leftist rage mob did it? One commenterarguedthat Wendy s had committed a grave error by“bending the knee”to blacklivesmatter , and that the company could have found other ways to show that black lives truly do matter. Still, there were some who were more sympathetic and expressed bafflement over why protesters would take their rage out on a burger joint. Sir, this is a Wendy s.pic.twitter.com/rXDyAVLEdo This isn t the first time that Wendy s has felt the wrath of anti-racist demonstrators. Riots that broke out in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police left a local Wendy s restaurant charred and gutted after blazes spread across the city.

"12 Jun, 2020",‘Absurd and shameful’ Churchill monument at risk: British PM Johnson says UK anti-racism protests ‘hijacked by extremists’,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has decried threats to the national monument honoring former UK leader Winston Churchill by “violent protestors,” in a barrage of tweets published on Friday. Johnson credited Churchill with“saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny,”but acknowledged that the former British prime minister had expressed unpalatable opinions“that were and are unacceptable.” The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny. 1/8 “It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protestors,”Johnson wrote, adding that modern Britain cannot“try to edit or censor our past,”and that the current spate of removing statutes and monuments to controversial figures is not the way to deal with racial injustice and inequality. But it is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence. The attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent. 7/8 “Those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults,”Johnson said, lamenting that the protests across the world in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police“have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence.” He concluded his Twitter broadside against the recent protest movements targeting statues and historical monuments by asking the public to refrain from participating.“The only responsible course of action is to stay away from these protests.” Johnson made Friday’s remarks as Churchill’s monument had to be covered ahead of upcoming demonstrations, as statues across the world, deemed offensive by some, have fallen victim to the rage of protesters. The Winston Churchill Statue in Parliament Square, Westminster was defaced on the 76th anniversary of D-Day on June 6, spray-painted with the letters ‘ACAB’, an anti-police slogan used in blacklivesmatter protests in the past.

"12 Jun, 2020",‘Mostly peaceful riots’? Mainstream media has given up any shred of objectivity over blacklivesmatter violence. How thick do they think we are?,"Media outlets in the US and UK have been conducting mental gymnastics worthy of Cirque du Soleil to portray rioters as virtuous, non-violent freedom fighters even as they film them starting fires and ripping down statues. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall You may have noticed the word “peaceful” being bandied about on your TV screens and appearing in headlines all over the internet a lot recently. “Peaceful” is an interesting adjective, because in most cases if something is peaceful, it is self-evident. For example, you’d only have to look at a photograph of a yoga retreat or a calm lake on a warm summer’s day and your brain would instantly think, “peaceful”. Likewise, with its opposite “violent”; normally if something is violent it is perfectly obvious: baying mobs, cage fighting, Quentin Tarantino movies - they’re violent and you don’t need to be told they are. Which is why it is rather interesting that “peaceful” has crept into the headlines of countless stories about the recent protests following the tragic death of George Floyd. Virtually every news outlet, from CNN to MSNBC to the BBC and Sky News, even the Daily Mail, have insisted that all the demonstrations in his name have been mainly placid, well-mannered affairs. They seem to have forgotten, however, that the cameras are rolling. The first widely memed incident of this sort of coverage wasfootagefrom MSNBC. This showed reporter Ali Velshi standing outside a building in Minneapolis that was literally on fire as looting took place all around him, insisting that what was going on was “mostly a protest” and “was not generally speaking unruly”. Next CNNrevealedto us that Target was temporarily closing some of its stores and adjusting opening hours“amid protests”. What this headline neglected to mention was that a branch of Target in Minneapolis was one of the first to get looted in the city during the“peaceful”protests. There were many other instances in cities across the US of protestors“liberating”Nike sneakers and Louis Vuitton handbags because of oppression or something. Interestingly, in America these“peaceful protests”have led to curfews and the National Guard being called out in several states. Obviously, these protests eventually spread to the UK because Orange Man Bad or Tories Racist, perhaps both. These began in Hyde Park last week where thousands gathered in flagrant disregard of social distancing to complain about a crime that happened 4,000 miles away. Eventually, a crowd gathered outside Downing Street and began hurling projectiles at the British police officers guarding the Prime Minister’s home while chanting“Boris is a pussyhole”. This resulted in 13 arrests after a“scuffle”broke out between police and some of the protestors. Sky News were running a live blog on the event and did report this“scuffle”, but added:“It should be noted that all those present say the huge majority of the protests passed peacefully”. Well, that’s alright then. The protests sprang up again at the weekend in London, which definitely had everything to do with fighting racism and nothing to do with the entire city being housebound for three months. This event resulted in widespread civil unrest, vandalism, a total lack of social distancing and bottles and bicycles being hurled at mounted police. We were also greeted with the ridiculous spectacle of protestors shouting“hands up, don’t shoot”at unarmed British police officers, who were later filmed running away from the madding crowd. It also resulted in a  female mounted police officer being left with serious injuries, including a broken collar bone and collapsed lung, after protestors threw firecrackers at her horse, causing it to bolt and smash her into a traffic light. The crowd’s reaction? It was to cheer. The Daily Telegraph said theshocking incidentsoccurred“following the largely peaceful blacklivesmatter protests”. And how did the BBCreportthis event?“27 police officers injured at largely peaceful anti-racism protest”. I’d hate to see what Auntie’s news division considers“a bit of a barney”if 27 injured coppers still qualify as“mostly peaceful”. It seems safe to say if 27 police officers were injured at an FA Cup final it wouldn’t be regarded as a“mostly peaceful”football match. Although not as blatant as the BBC’s reportage, Sky News was also at pains topoint outthat the injuries happened after a“largely peaceful day”.I somehow doubt a pro-Brexit rally that resulted in dozens of injured policemen would have received quite such understanding coverage. Even when they don’t try to claim that obvious violence is in fact peaceful, the MSM offers soft touch coverage. Rather than describing the people who ripped down a statue of Edward Colston in Bristol as vandals, which they are, they were called anti-racism protestors. Quite how the demonstrators have any argument to be protesting against police brutality when the officer in charge of “policing” the protest appeared on TV in a gay pride lanyard and defended his failure to do anything to stop this destruction of property, I don’t know. It also bleeds into coverage of the issues surrounding the protests, such as deaths in police custody. On June 3, the BBC published ananalysisbreaking down by race the number of people who have died in police custody in England and Wales over the past ten years. What this piece found was that 85% of people who have died in police custody since 2009 were white and 8% were black. That means that a white person who is arrested is 25% more likely to die in police custody than a black person. The article was headlined:“George Floyd death: How many black people die in police custody in England and Wales?” Do we for one second believe if it had turned out that black people were 25% more likely to die in police custody than white people that this wouldn’t have been the headline? One doesn’t need to be a rocket scientist to conclude that they are burying this fact because it doesn’t fit the narrative. Even the immigrant hating, Tory loving, evilDaily Mailis joining in on the act. This week it ran anarticleheadlined“Fears of violence as far-Right groups outline plans to defend statues in London this weekend”. Oh now there are fears of violence? Because last weekend’s statue toppling, police attacking, missile throwing display of unbridled yobbery was completely justified because it was done in the name of diversity? How thick do they think the viewing, reading public is if they believe they can show footage of a rioting mob and we’ll believe it is a peaceful protest just because they say it is? Can they stop pretending that they are even making the vaguest attempt at objectivity when it comes to covering the blacklivesmatter protests. We get it, you either completely approve of these actions or are so petrified of being branded racist for pointing out that the movement has been infiltrated by revolutionary Marxist thugs that you have decided not to do your jobs properly. Whichever of these two options is the case, just admit it and stop insulting our intelligence by pretending to be impartial. Violence is never peaceful, regardless of what Big Brother might say.

"9 Jun, 2020","Party like it’s 1929! Buying into bankrupt companies is insane. It’s dot-com bubble x 10mn, and it’s doomed to fail","The US Federal Reserve does not understand the moral hazard caused by reckless ‘money-printing’ policies, or the difference between liquidity and solvency.

The Business Cycle Dating Committee of The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) determined that the US economy peaked in February 2020, marking the longest business expansion since business-cycle records began in 1854. An impressive 128-month run from June 2009, before entering into a lockdown-induced recession in February 2020. Stock markets gleefully rejoiced at the grim news. Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell, please take a bow. Mission accomplished. These Federal Reserve ex-chairs and current chairman are responsible for breaking the law, distorting price discovery and inflating the most grotesque asset bubbles in history. Bravo! Never mind the virus or the riots, it’s buy, buy, buy! After the Federal Reserve announced they would offer bailouts to small, main-street businesses that banks would not touch with a barge pole, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 500 points, adding to the almost 1,000-point gain of last Friday. And the NASDAQ rocketed to all-time new highs, closing up at a record 9,924. The NASDAQ will bubble over 10,000 and keep going until it doesn’t. Just party like it’s 1929! The Federal Reserve has no legal authority to monetize debt or to create extraordinary amounts of leverage, putting the taxpayers on the hook for their fiscal profligacy. The fundamental problem is the Fed does not understand the difference between liquidity and solvency. In capitalism, bankruptcy is a mechanism used to deal with poorly run businesses that are unprofitable. By providing liquidity to these poorly run businesses, the Fed is not creating solutions. It is creating more debt and a world filled with profitless zombie corporations that eventually go bankrupt – only with much more debt. Unlimited Federal Reserve bailouts have created an “illusion”for retail investors, that stocks can never go down and that corporations do not need profits, earnings or a sustainable business model, because“the Fed has your back.” Let’s take one example of what happens when the market s ability to price risk and accurately determine valuations is undermined by reckless snake oil salespeople masquerading as omnipotent oracles? Take the case of Chesapeake Energy. It is the biggest shale oil producer in America, and its shares, CHK, had a very wild ride indeed today. Here is my overview of a few of the CHK headlines that rolled off my ticker late today during post-market trading: June 08, 2020 1:16 pm ET Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) halted due to volatility. 1:21 pm ET Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) resumed trading. 2:14 pm ET Crude prices drop but oil stocks are rising. Here s what s behind it. 2:16 pm ET Chesapeake Energy up over 140%, on pace for record percent increase. 4:27 pm ET UPDATE: Chesapeake Energy s stock nearly triples, trading up at $84 after 22 trading halts. 5:11 pm ET Chesapeake Energy shares are trading lower after it was reported the company will prepare a Chapter 11 filing, giving lenders control. I have been extremely bearish on oil prices since 2018 (here) and, in the first week of April 2020, I predicted that we would see oil at $10 a barrel, which would bankrupt many of the highly leveraged shale oil and gas producers (here). The Federal Reserve has promised“unlimited bailouts,”but how will they bail out the oil and gas sector, and all the other zombies? The leader in the US shale fracking oil and gas revolution, Chesapeake Energy Corp., like many of the zombie corporations on life support thanks to the Federal Reserve’s policy of low-interest rates and moral hazard, has been on the brink of insolvency for years. The collapse in oil prices from March-May has pushed Chesapeake over the edge. One week ago, CHK was trading at $12.82 per share. In last night’s after-market, CHK traded up at $84.75 per share; that’s an increase of 563 percent in only a week. At 17:11 on June 8, CHK announced that it was preparing Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing papers and the stock crashed over 50 percent in only a few hours after its meteoric rise – a jump that occurred for no reason except for momentum traders (MOMO) buying for fear of missing out (FOMO). CHK’s stock movement illustrates a textbook“irrational exuberance”and indicates that retail is all-in as markets become even more irrational. Greater fools buy at any price because some other fool in the Fed will bail them out. The bad news is that in Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings, all the equity (stocks) becomes worthless and its price falls to zero. Chesapeake Energy Corp. has a massive debt problem, owing nine billion dollars with a debt payment due on June 15. Should CHK default on this payment or file Chapter 11 bankruptcy, CHK will likely cause a tsunami of industry shale oil and fracking defaults that may spark the next phase of our crisis. On the other hand, Hertz Global Holdings Inc, the large international car rental company, declared bankruptcy two weeks ago, and its shares traded as low as 40 cents. Today, these shares traded at $6.90 per share, or an increase of 1,623 percent in around 10 days. Federal Reserve policies have empowered retail investors on trading sites like Robinhood to believe what a millennial told me last week: “Trading is easy; anyone can become a millionaire because the Federal Reserve’s job is to ensure that stocks only go up.” Delusion or reality? Only time will tell. But I know what I think, after a few decades of working on Wall Street. I’m not a buyer of these zombie companies like Hertz and CHK at the best of times, let alone now. These zombies are dead companies with no chance of survival and which only burn cash. No real investor would buy these: only a drunken, no-hoper gambler would – they are dead ends. So in June 2020, in the midst of all that’s ravaging our world and 40 million unemployed Americans, stocks are trading at the highest valuations in history, not just in the bankrupt companies. Those sorts of extreme heights normally imply a humming economy with high GDP, full employment and the economy roaring along in tip-top shape, not an economy suffering from a full-blown economic depression featuring the greatest wealth inequality in history. This is just a crazy BUBBLE inflated by the Fed s money printing. And while no one can predict how high it will go, we do know, like Chesapeake shares, that it’s all going to end in a lot of tears.

"9 Jun, 2020",Texas judge declares June 9 ‘George Floyd Day’ as protests rage on,"A judge in Texas has proclaimed June 9 “George Floyd Day.” Floyd was killed two weeks ago by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, despite his desperate pleas for his life. In a tweet on Monday, Judge Lina Hidalgo said people“must never forget the name George Floyd or the global movement he has inspired.” We must never forget the name George Floyd or the global movement he has inspired. I’m proud to announce that tomorrow I will proclaim Tuesday, June 9th, George Floyd Day in Harris County. Floyd’s brutal death sparked massive anti-police-brutality and blacklivesmatter demonstrations across the US, which subsequently spread overseas to cities such as London, Paris, Rome and Madrid, among others. While the protests have largely been peaceful, some have descended into violence and rioting. On Monday, the public was offered the opportunity to pay its last respects to Floyd, with a public viewing of his casket drawing thousands to a church in Houston. Many wore masks and T-shirts emblazoned with the words“I can’t breathe.” Mourners stood in line for hours to enter the Fountain of Praise church, at which Floyd had been a worshiper for much of his life.

"8 Jun, 2020",Apple & Google ‘woke-ify’ virtual assistants to educate users on blacklivesmatter ,"Apple and Google have programmed their trademark voice assistants to respond to questions about the blacklivesmatter movement, as well as to scold those who ask them about ‘all lives matter.’ Business Insiderreportsthat tech companies across the board are training their voice assistants to respond to questions on the blacklivesmatter ( blacklivesmatter ) movement. On Sunday, sports blogger David Gardner tweeted a video showing his Google Home smart speaker responding to the question“Do blacklivesmatter ?” In response, Google’s voice assistant parroted the party line: “ blacklivesmatter . Black people deserve the same freedoms afforded to everyone in this country, and recognizing the injustice they face is the first step towards fixing it.” When Gardner then asked“Do all lives matter?”the Google Home responded:“Saying ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ doesn t mean that all lives don’t. It means black lives are at risk in ways others are not.” Business Insider reports that Apple’s Siri gave a similar response. However, as seen in this video, when asked“Do white lives matter?”Siri becomes confused and is unable to give a response. I know y’all already ask Siri do blacklivesmatter .... but have y’all asked her do white lives matter? Lmfaoooopic.twitter.com/B0G2GuRTym The pre-recordings come in the wake of a deluge of statements from the heads of major tech companies. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced a series of initiatives in support of the black community. Apple CEO Tim Cook published an open letter on racism on June 4, after being criticized for staying silent during the protest. Throughout the blacklivesmatter protests, after years of stating that words are violence, a new rallying cry,‘silence is violence,’is being used against those who fail to make overt comments in support of blacklivesmatter . On Friday, Alex Ohanian, founder and former CEO of Reddit, stepped down from the Reddit board, asking to be replaced by a person of color. Finally, on Sunday, Jeff Bezos of Amazon shared an email from a disillusioned customer against the blacklivesmatter banner on the Amazon website. I got this email from a customer and wanted to share my response. Публикация отJeff Bezos(@jeffbezos)5 Июн 2020 в 3:05 PDT Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"4 Jun, 2020",Almost 40k demand removal of statues showing colonial-era Belgian king blamed for Congo genocide,"Amid ongoing anti-racism protests in the US, two petitions have been launched in Belgium demanding the removal of statues depicting King Leopold II. Estimates suggest the late monarch s brutal Congo rule left some 10 million dead. The petitions, launched several days ago, have already attracted nearly 40,000 backers. The campaigns demand the removal of all statues of King Leopold II, who ruled the country between 1865 and 1909. While for Belgium itself he was a constitutional monarch, Leopold was also a brutal oppressor of Africans. The king was the founder – and sole owner – of the so-called Congo Free State , a colonial entity that existed in Central Africa in the late 1800s. The state produced rubber and ivory, making a fortune for the king, while his brutal rule took a heavy toll on the locals. According to modern estimates, some 10 million people died at hands of Leopold s colonial troops, due to rampant diseases and various abuses. Given this background, the petitions argue, monuments honoring the king have no place in Belgium – especially in Brussels, which sees itself as the capital of the united multicultural Europe. One  petition requested that the statues be completely removed from the country by the end of June. The campaign against the Leopold monuments is apparently not just limited to gathering signatures online. In the city of Ghent, a bust of Leopold II was doused in red paint, with a bag reading“I can t breathe”placed on its head. Another statue of the king was set on fire near the city of Antwerp. The bust of King Leopold II of Belgium, who orchestrated the colonial genocide of 10 million Congolese people, has been defaced by protesters in Ghent, Belgium.The movement against racism and injustice is truly global!pic.twitter.com/MZLlX7eeFZ The US protests against racism and police brutality, sparked by the death of black man George Floyd at hands of Minneapolis police, have been going on for over a week already, spreading to all of the nation s states. In many locations, the protests turned into full-blown riots, with rampant arson, looting and violence. The unrest in the US has triggered solidarity protests in Europe, with thousands taking to the streets to defy racism and condemn local problems with policing. In certain countries – the UK and France, for instance – some of the rallies have also turned violent. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

"2 Jun, 2020","Instagram narcissists, please tell us how exactly Blackout Tuesday helps address structural inequalities of US society?","Yet another vacuous online campaign has been spreading like a digital coronavirus so people can shout how much they care about George Floyd. You might want to practice social media distancing to avoid this cavalcade of banality. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall You will be relieved to know that the internet attention-seekers of the world have found a way to make George Floyd’s death all about themselves. From San Diego to Sydney and from London to Buenos Aires, Instagrammers are supporting #BlackoutTuesday in a pointless show of vanity dressed up as activism. Is there anything more self-involved or purposeless than this? The idea behind the campaign is not to be active across social media today because this will finally end racism or something. Interestingly, the way all these bandwagon-jumping narcissists have chosen to not be active across social media is by posting a black square on their Instagram profiles and announcing to everyone that they will not be active across social media today. God, aren’t they just like Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi all rolled into one? How noble and righteous of them! Surely in the face of such stunning bravery, Klansmen will ditch their robes for kaftans and trade burning crosses for singing‘We Are The World.’At long last, it turns out all that was required to end racism in America was one Instagram post from some politically correct Penelope/Felicity/Bianca from Brighton; it must have been the clenched fist emojis that finally clinched it. Or maybe it was that bloke from that reality TV show a few years ago who put the final nail in the coffin of racism? No, it must’ve beenMiley Cyrus, orTom Brady, orChris Hemsworth, after all if you can twerk, win the Superbowl or defeat Thanos, then you can obviously overcome racism. I suppose the argument, as is always the case in these instances, is that they are “raising awareness,” because obviously the blanket media coverage, protests, riots and looting would have passed us by without being helpfully informed by someone who couldn’t find Minneapolis on a map that “Orange man bad.” But as is always the case with these ostentatious displays of virtue, the fact that you are seen to care is more important than whether you actually do. Let alone achieve. For British virtue-signalers, this latest outpouring of impotent rage has come at the perfect time, as they will no longer be banging their pans in the street every Thursday to show how much they like hospitals. Indeed, apparently Covid-19 doesn’t spread in protests as long as they are against racism. What possible other reason can there be for the police not nicking everyone who ignored social-distancing rules to gather in Trafalgar Square at the weekend to wave placards about a police incident that occurred over 4,000 miles and an ocean away? The truly depressing thought is that these same people will soon get bored of this particular problem and move on to something else. Now we’re in Pride Month (or June as it used to be called), the black squares will be replaced by rainbow flags and America’s greatest sin will move on from being racism to homo-trans-bi-phobia. The lectures about white privilege will be swapped for ones about cisgender and straight privilege. The ever spinning merry-go-round of fashionablebien-pensantconcerns will carry on turning, the hashtags will keep on trending, and nothing will change. What does the black square do?How does this sort of self-promoting Twitter activism from one-percenters actually address very real iniquities in America?#blackouttuesdayMORE:https://t.co/9sYw9e10ONhttps://t.co/1OcbcKwJnF If you like this story, share it with a friend!
