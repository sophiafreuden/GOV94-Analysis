"16 Mar, 2021",Portland’s mayor says public are ‘sick and tired’ of the nightly riots… he’s done nothing to stop,"Mayor Ted Wheeler appears to have finally worked out that the residents of Portland, Oregon might be losing patience with endless rioting and vandalism. If only he were in a position to do something about it. Portland is a joke. The city has gone from being a byword for early-2010s hipsterism, replete with vegan bookstores and feminist interpretive dance studios, to a s**tholeteemingwith addicts and the homeless, where nihilist ‘Antifa’ rioters come out every night to smash windows, start fires, and assault police officers. For nine months straight, the riots have been an almost nightly occurrence. In the past week alone, black-clad left-wingers set a federal courthouse on fire, vandalized downtown shopfronts, and pelted rocks and beer cans at police officers. Cops seized knives, hammers, and firearms. Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, has declared that enough is enough.“The community is sick and tired of people engaging in criminal destruction and violence, and doing it under the guise of some noble cause,”Wheeler told apress conferenceon Monday night.“We want you to know that we’re aligning our resources, we’re revising our tactics, and we’re fighting back with everything that we’ve got.” Wheeler didn’t say what form the city’s pushback would take, but he’scondemnedthe violence before and done nothing. If the fire-startingreprobatesbesieging his city listened to strongly worded statements, Portland wouldn’t be the cesspool it is. Alas they don’t, and Wheeler hasn’t really got anything stronger to offer. Let’s see what he’s tried so far. When then-president Donald Trump deployed federal agents last summer to protect government buildings from the nightly battering by the Antifa crowd, Wheeler demanded they stand down, publicly declaring,“This is not the America we want.”He then tried speaking to the protesters to figure out their demands, but was met with chants of“F**k Ted Wheeler”and caught in a cloud of tear gas. As the summer dragged on, they ignored his repeated pleas for calm, adding insult to injury in August by surrounding his condo and chucking burning trash through the windows as Wheeler celebrated his birthday inside. Antifa rioters have grown the fire outside@tedwheeler’s condo in NW Portland. There is black smoke everywhere on the street. Meanwhile, they are still shining lights into people’s homes.#PortlandRiotspic.twitter.com/MCv6H7Blbf Any sane man would turn the police loose on these degenerates, but Ted Wheeler is not a sane man. Instead, hebannedthe cops from using tear gas on rioters, cut the force’s budget by $7 million (weeks before the city’s council stripped another$15 millionfrom the budget with his support), and announced a host of“bold”reforms, which includedscrappinga gun-violence reduction unit. As a result, the city’s homicide rate soared to its highest level in nearly three decades. None of these measures appeased the mob, nor has the passing of time lessened their appetite for destruction. Wheeler pulled $15 million from the police budget, protesters demanded $50 million. They called him“Tear Gas Ted”when he sent in police officers, but attacked him when he tried talking to them. George Floyd’s alleged killer, Derek Chauvin, will soon have his day in court, but the riots continue under the guise of blacklivesmatter ing. Donald Trump is out of office, but the left-wing violence is ongoing. Wheeler, like Minneapolis’ cuckoldedMayor Jacob Frey, radiates weakness, and the mob can smell it. Emboldened by the fact that they’ve largely gotten away with their nine-month crime spree, they’re showing zero intention of backing off now. At a certain point, appeasement becomes masochism. I can only speculate as to whether Wheeler has a thing for humiliation, but it’s not just the mayor hurting here. As he said himself,“the community”is tired of the lawlessness. Wheeler could end the destruction in a night. As both mayor and police commissioner, he could single-handedly order a crackdown on the riots, and he’d have the support of the public, who’vedemandedthe police use more force, not less. Law and order isn’t a political position; it’s a prerequisite for a civilized society to exist and thrive. Wheeler may be starting to realize this on some level, as he said last week that he’ll seek $2 million in funding to bring back the anti-gun taskforce he cut last summer. While $2 million is a fraction of the sum he pulled from policing in 2021, it may well be the start of an actual pushback in more than words. After months of embarrassing kowtowing before the dregs of the left, it’s the least he can do. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/518266-portland-ted-wheeler-weak/
"15 Mar, 2021","Derek Chauvin lawyers ‘gravely concerned’ about juror impartiality after George Floyd civil settlement, ask for trial delay","Lawyers for Minneapolis ex-cop and accused murderer Derek Chauvin are desperate to postpone his trial, hoping to find impartial jurors to hear the high-profile case after the city of Minneapolis delivered a massive settlement. With nine jurors seated as of Monday afternoon, the defense was granted a motion to eventually recall those who’d already been seated before the city of Minneapolis delivered the largest-ever civil settlement to the family of George Floyd on Friday. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill agreed to “call back the seven [jurors] to see if they ve read anything or if it changes their minds about whether they can be fair and impartial,"" complaining “I wish the city officials would stop talking about this case so much.” With just seven out of 14 jurors empaneled before the weekend, lead defense attorney Eric Nelson attempted to push the date of Chauvin’s trial further into the future, asking for a continuance and renewing his plea to move the trial to another city. Nelson argued that the enormously high-profile case stood no chance of receiving a fair hearing in his client’s home city after the city of Minneapolis delivered what it said was one of the largest-ever wrongful death settlements to victim George Floyd’s family. Chauvin’s attorneys made it clear they did not believe they would be able to find seven more jurors capable of hearing the case impartially in light of the $27 million wrongful death payout, with Nelson saying the settlement had “incredible potential to taint the jury pool.” The former cop’s legal team said it was “gravely concerned” about the impact of the mammoth payout to the family of Floyd, the black ex-convict who died during an arrest in which Chauvin kneeled on his neck for almost nine excruciating minutes. Video of Chauvin restraining Floyd on Memorial Day went viral last year, kicking off a summer of violent unrest and protests across the country and overseas. Chauvin faces charges of second- and third-degree murder over Floyd’s death, as well as a charge of manslaughter. His trial is scheduled to begin on March 29, and jury selection is underway even as the case remains one of the highest-profile in the country. The third-degree murder charge was reinstated by Judge Cahill just last week. The Minneapolis City Council unanimously approved the $27 million payout to Floyd’s estate on Friday, including $500,000 earmarked for the neighborhood where he died. The ex-cop has pleaded not guilty on all charges. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/518180-chauvin-jurors-panel-minneapolis-floyd/
"14 Mar, 2021","‘Move in groups, loot stores’: BLM protest over black woman’s arrest descends into violence in Belgium (VIDEOS)","A protest against police brutality in Liege, Belgium has spiraled into clashes and looting, after an initially peaceful demonstration was hijacked by around 200 hooligans who went on to wreck the city center, police said. Demonstrators took to the streets of the eastern Belgian city on Saturday to protest the arrest of a black woman by police earlier this week. The march was peaceful until a group of rowdy youth joined in, and then spread through the city center, wreaking havoc. “We are dealing with two hundred young people, ‘casseurs’, who move very quickly, in groups, and loot stores,”a police spokeswoman told AFP. Vandals smashed store windows and“ransacked a whole McDonald’s”in their assault on city businesses, police said.

The woman, identified by local media as Tania, said that she approached the officers herself after she saw them surrounding a woman, who apparently felt unwell. Being a caregiver, she said she wanted to help the woman until the ambulance arrived. However, her interaction with the police quickly took a turn for the worse. Police defended the officers’ conduct, claiming that the woman, who is now being accused of“rebellion,”went berserk and bit one of the officers, which led to the incident. Police spokesperson Jadranka Lozinadescribedthe use of force as“a clean, justified intervention,”insisting that“police have nothing to be ashamed of.” The incident has drawn comparisons with the death of American man George Floyd in police custody, which triggered a wave of protests in the US last year.

"13 Mar, 2021",‘Respect to him’: Crystal Palace ace Zaha becomes first Premier League star NOT to take a knee after describing it as ‘degrading’,"Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha made good on his vow not to take a knee anymore as he became the first Premier League star to go against the grain since the gesture was introduced. Zaha stood tall while others around him knelt before the kick-off as Palace took on West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday, making the 28-year-old Ivory Coast star the first footballer in England’s top flight to shun the move. 🗣""I will continue to stand tall""Wilfried Zaha becomes first Premier League player to not take a kneepic.twitter.com/1EKG1WMbyl The former Manchester United star initially explained his decision back in February, saying:“I feel like taking a knee is degrading. “Growing up, my parents just let me know that I should just be proud to be black, no matter what, and I just think we should stand tall. “I think the meaning behind the whole thing is becoming something that we just do now. That’s not enough. I’m not going to take the knee.” Players in England adopted the gesture on the resumption of football last June, amid the swell of the blacklivesmatter movement following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in America. blacklivesmatter signs can still be found at Premier League stadiums, although the league itself has since replaced logos bearing the BLM name with a ‘No Room for Racism’ message on players’ shirts instead. On Saturday at Selhurst Park, Zaha stood with his hands behind his back and facing forwards while others on the pitch – including officials – dropped to one knee. The act from the forward won widespread praise on social media. “Respectful decision...I understand where he is coming from. Half the players and people do it to fulfill righteousness, you might as well stop,”wroteone fan. “Stop the kneeling. It doesn’t help anything [or] anyone. We need concrete action,”wroteanother. “Respect to him. Taking a knee isn’t going to change anything and it undermines the whole thing,”read another response.

Some of us still continue to receive abuse,”he said.

""As a society, I feel we should be encouraging better education in schools...and social media companies should be taking stronger action against people who abuse others – not just footballers – online. I now want to focus on football and enjoy playing. ""I will continue to stand tall."" Zaha is far from the only football figure to question the gesture. Players at second-tier Championship clubs Queens Park Rangers, Brentford, Bournemouth and Derby Countyare among thosenot to drop to one knee before games. Speaking to RT Sport in February, former Liverpool and England icon John Barnes said the gesture was ultimately just a token and could not change“systemic racism.” “Taking the knee highlights the problem, and it s been highlighting the problems since the George Floyd situation.That s all,”Barnes said. “…So if people feel that all they can do is highlight it, then take a knee. But if they feel they want to do more and taking a knee is a token gesture – and in many respects it is just a token gesture – if they decide not to do it because they want to do something else, I m fine [with that]. ""I wouldn t be taking a knee. However, I don t say that people shouldn t be taking a knee. But taking a knee does nothing apart from highlight the problem.""

"13 Mar, 2021","White people may not like it, but here’s why it’s time for black descendents of slaves to be paid billions in reparations","I’ve got ancestors who toiled on the plantations of the Caribbean and America, and others who were exploited under colonial rule. They deserve justice and we – just like the relatives of Holocaust victims – deserve compensation. David Matthewsis a writer whose work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday and the Observer, and on the BBC and Channel 4. He is the author of several books, including Voices of the Windrush Generation. Follow him on Twitter@mrdavematthews. With the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, set to become thefirst city in Americato pay black residents reparations, millions of clenched fists will be punching the air throughout the African diaspora. I for one will be raising a glass to the city’s good burghers who’ve come up with the novel idea of using a three percent tax levy on recreational cannabis sales, among other things, to finance a fund aimed at distributing $10 million over 10 years. It’s just one decisive step in a burgeoning issue: right across America, hundreds of communities and organisations are examining the reparations issue like never before. From California’s state legislature to small cities like Evanston, to religious denominations such as the Episcopal Church and leading colleges like Georgetown University in Washington, hundreds of entities aren’t just idly mulling over or waffling about such payments – they’re looking at how to put them into practice. This comes after the US congress heard testimony on ‘H.R. 40’ – a bill aimed at establishing a commission on the legacy of slavery to examine potential payments for the descendants of enslaved Africans. I’m all for reparations – and not just because I’ve had my eye on a Porsche 911 for ages. Over the years, I’ve heard much bellyaching from vested-interest whites and Stockholm-syndromed blacks who can’t spell ‘reparations’ let alone figure out innovative and realistic mechanisms for paying this highly contested, but arguably just, form of restitution. Detractors moan that it ‘can’t be done’ or ‘it’ll never work’ or ‘who deserves it?’ or ‘where will it all end?’ – as if they actually give a fig about the ethics, morality or practicalities of reparations. Enough, already. We all know what your problem is: you just don’t want black people to ‘get even’. But eons of old-boy networks, patronage, nepotism, bungs, backhanders, bigotry and BS about the scourge of positive discrimination (aka ‘a break’) aside, if we can land a multibillion-dollar one-ton Tonka toy on Mars while simultaneously paying millions of people hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, pounds and euros to get drunk and sit around at home watching daytime television, then we can figure out how to literally settle this blacks v. whites beef once and for all. I’ll happily STFU about racism forever if you just show me the dough and point me to the dotted line I need to sign. Hell, throw in a generous repatriation bonus and I’ll willingly ‘go back to where I came from’. Just name your price. Whether it’s governments, corporations, banks, the landed gentry… I really don’t care who’s paying. I want to be your friend as much as you want to be mine. So, let’s just cut the pretence about ‘healing’ or ‘coming together’ or creating a ‘post-racial’ world. Just pay up and let’s all go about our business. Because if the West doesn’t start coughing up, things are gonna start blowing up. Real soon. The killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the subsequent rise of blacklivesmatter may well have been a game changer. Certainly, the movement has catalysed current thinking in ways previously unimaginable, particularly among white people (did I really see the footballer John Terry sporting a BLM T-shirt last year?). But BLM, the Black Panthers, MLK, Malcolm X, the Maroons, Queen Nanny, Harriet Tubman, Toussaint Louverture and millions of ordinary black people within the diaspora have been arguing against slavery and thus for reparations for centuries. According to University College London’s (UCL) Legacies of British Slave-ownershipresearch, 10% of wealthy 19th-century Britons were directly connected to the slave trade. Proceeds from this ‘human cargo’ helped build railways, businesses, buildings and art collections that exist today. Perversely, when the British introduced their 30-year trickle-down abolition programme in the early 1800s, they paid some £20 million in reparations, not to newly emancipated slaves, but to the slave owners for their loss of “property”. In today’s money, this compensation would be worth around £2.4 billion. Needless to say, punching a 19th-century sum into an online inflation calculator does neither the economics of slavery nor its far-reaching legacy any justice. For one, a couple of billion pounds is chicken feed. It seems incalculable assessing the cost to those African states and a diaspora that has borne the brunt of 300 years of transatlantic slavery, in which upwards of 12 million kidnapped bodies were shipped off to, shunted between, and sacrificed at the altar of Western decadence. Former special advisor to Barack Obama Stuart E. Eizenstat hasargued, like many others opposed to reparations, that cash payments are not the way forward. This comes from someone who “spent decades of my life negotiating more than $17 billion in reparations for Holocaust survivors” from German governments. But every day, on the courthouse steps of Britain, America and other former slave-running Western powers, in cases from sex discrimination to libel to copyright infringement to breaches of contract, billions of dollars in claims are settled before litigation begins. Why? Because it’s more cost-effective to settle up and “make the problem go away”. If you don’t believe it works, just ask Donald Trump, or Bill Clinton… Doing the right thing avoids future embarrassment and, whether by default or by design, in giving the ‘plaintiffs’ within the diaspora financial restitution it helps to silence at least some of the animus between black people and elites. I stress the latter because another false narrative put about by the anti-reparations dog whistlers is that the overwhelming majority of ordinary white people – unconnected as they are historically or as beneficiaries to slavery – should be made to feel responsible and pay compensation through personal taxation. This is nonsense. Reparations could easily be paid via those legions of tax-dodging, money laundering and racketeering entities that have gotten away with it for too long. That’s not to say that there aren’t legitimate arguments against reparations. For instance, take everyone’s favourite African-American conservative – 90-year-old economist, social theorist, and Stanford University senior fellow Thomas Sowell. Responding to the writer Ta Nehisi Coates’ impassioned essay, The Case for Reparations, and referencing his time living through America’s Jim Crow segregation, Sowell has said: “It was a rotten system, but I don’t know how we get from that to reparations. What we see in the United States in terms of the bad things we see all around the world. If you were to give reparations to everyone whose ancestors had been slaves, I suspect that you’d have to give reparations to more than half the entire globe. Slavery was not confined to one set of races. I suspect that most of the people [who were] either slaves or slave owners around the world were neither white nor black. I mean, this was a universal curse of the human species.” There is, however, no statute of limitation in law, nor a moral or ethical concept, governing restitution for slavery. So what if the Romans enslaved ‘X’ or the Egyptians enslaved ‘Y’. It’s not just a false comparison to liken the slavery of antiquity or that imposed on the Irish or Scottish or whoever with transatlantic human trafficking; in the British context, at least, it makes a mockery of the link between pre- and industrial revolution slavery, colonialism, post-colonialism, and the economic mess many within the diaspora are in today. Reparations need to be paid because the transatlantic slave trade, put simply, is but one chapter in a centuries-old system of exploitation that got me and millions of others to where we are today. Other ethnic groups can argue the toss as to whether they’re owed or ‘deserve’ reparations. Good luck to them. But I take a pragmatic view of the issue: post-slavery, my parents and grandparents lived under British colonial rule, i.e., they existed not in a democracy, but in a de facto fascist state. They were socially engineered as a result of the slave trade and then forced to toil under a colonial-fascist regime before a scorched-earth imperialist policy coerced them to Britain to work as cheap immigrant labour. Talk about a win-win-win for the (white) man. I’m neither a religious man, nor an establishment toady. Likewise, I’d never deign to call myself a ‘man of the people’. But I do appreciate how scripture, elitist rhetoric and straight-talking vox populi helps to expose the rank hypocrisy surrounding our ever-present discourse on race and, increasingly, slave-trade reparations. While 63 per cent of Americansbelieve in Godwith “absolute certainty”, only one in five thinks that the US government should use “taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.” This figure plummets to just 10% when the same question is put towhite Americans only. Patently, Americans have a problem with numbers. Literally. As the Good Book says, Numbers 14:18: “The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.” I know many people who can go back three or four generations and find relatives who were under the cosh or the lash picking cotton or cane in the Carolinas or West Indies back in the day. In fact, I’ve located a few not-so-distant relatives of mine connected to the plantations of the Caribbean and the Americas. Thanks to online genealogy sites, DNA databases and access to government and academic records, millions like me can draw direct lines back to thousands of slave owners, colonialists and their modern-day profiteers. Q.E.D. As Lord Hewart, the early-20th-century Lord Chief Justice of England, once said: “It is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.” When it comes to delivering ‘justice’ for the slave trade, and placating a reparations lobby that’s growing in strength, depth and influence, it’s time for those holding the purse strings to put up if they want those of us who support the movement to shut up.

"12 Mar, 2021",Minneapolis settles lawsuit from George Floyd estate for $27mn ahead of Derek Chauvin trial,"The Minneapolis City Council has unanimously approved a civil lawsuit settlement worth $27 million with the estate of George Floyd, over his death while being detained by police last year. The settlement includes $500,000 to be sent to the neighborhood where Floyd died during his arrest in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. The $27 million payment marks the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history. “That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a Black man sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end,”Ben Crump, the attorney representing the Floyd family, said in a statement. The city council’s decision comes ahead of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former officer accused of being responsible for Floyd’s death. Currently in custody, Chauvin is facing second-degree and third-degree murder charges, as well as one of manslaughter. The third-degree charge was added this week at the request of prosecutors. Floyd’s last moments and death went viral last year after a video showed Chauvin holding his knee against Floyd’s neck for approximately nine minutes after he was handcuffed and brought to the ground. Floyd became unresponsive and died. His death sparked massive blacklivesmatter protests in major cities across the country – some of which turned violent – as well as overseas. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is set to begin on March 29. Jury selection is currently underway. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC If I were to sit you down and tell you about an autonomous zone inside a major city where there are reports of violent crime and journalists are being threatened for approaching it, you’d probably think that I was referring to themadnessof Seattle last year. But no, the craziness has returned to another of America’s big cities. You see, it seems that there is now another autonomous zone in Minneapolis. George Floyd Square is a memorial site in south Minneapolis, at the corner where he passed away last year. Initially, the city itself put concrete barriers in place to prevent traffic from entering the area. After this happened, protesters moved in. Very recently, a journalist fromNewsNation Nowvisited the site to report on it, and wasthreatenedat the barricade. It’s also been reported that the area has been a hotbed of violent crime in recent months. Two arrests wereannouncedon Wednesday in connection with a fatal shooting last week, and this is simply the most recent incident. The protesters within the area have issued a list of 24demands, including recalling the county prosecutor, firing the head of the state’s criminal investigative agency, investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs to create jobs, combat racism, and support affordable housing, plus keeping the square closed until August. There have been talks of negotiations to end the zone, but this is a silly idea. Negotiation assumes that the person that you’re dealing with is of sound mind. These people are not of sound mind. Their request for the city to start firing government employees, and their desire to direct what the budget should be spent on, aren’t sensible demands. Why they’re even being taken seriously is beyond me. Here are the facts. Any area that has zero police presence and is basically being run and held hostage by ‘protesters’ is a massive risk to any citizen who lives in that area. We saw this in Seattle, and I genuinely wonder what additional evidence people need to understand this. Given the violentendof CHOP in Seattle, it’s hard to imagine how it could have gone any worse. Acting as if there is something to discuss or negotiate here is pointless. These people need to be stopped. It’s understandable that Minneapolis and its leadership are gun-shy after George Floyd. However, there needs to be recognition of the simple fact that lives are in danger, and are already being taken. For some reason, whenever this sort of thing happens, city governments are unwilling to defend the basic rights of their own citizenry. It’s pathetic. This is not a protest. You could argue that this is the real definition of domestic terrorism. If the people doing this were swearing fealty to ISIS, for example, the government would be all over it. But because these acts are done under the chant of blacklivesmatter , more lives will be lost. And all because we didn’t learn the lesson of Seattle.

"11 Mar, 2021","LA police was unprepared for George Floyd protest violence ‘not seen in years,’ believed it would be ‘peaceful’, report says","LAPD was poorly trained, demoralized and disorganized during the May-June 2020 riots, and mistakenly believed they would be peaceful instead of featuring violent and organized “disrupters,” according to a new report. Areportcommissioned by the Los Angeles, California city council faults the police for arresting too many people, and not enough violent rioters; using too much nonlethal ammunition, but not stopping the riots fast enough; jailing too many protesters, but not setting up field jails; and assuming“racial justice”protests would be peaceful based on prior experience, and therefore not being “proactive” about the unprecedented and unexpected violence that followed the death of George Floyd. Those are just some of the things that leap out of the report authored by a panel of former police commanders led by attorney Gerald Chaleff, and published Thursday. BREAKING: First after-action report on LAPD s handling of the summer protests and unrest finds poor planning, inadequate training, disregard for rules on mass arrests and crowd control established after past failures to manage protests (w/@AlpertReyes):https://t.co/KLVcCClJwq Floyd died in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 25, 2020. Riots broke out in the Twin Cities the very next day. Protests in downtown Los Angeles on May 27-28 were“marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality,”the report says, but LAPD treated them as isolated incidents rather than“as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across”the US. The violence caught the LAPD off guard, as they“had believed that the good relationships which had been developed with various communities would cause any protests to be peaceful, as they had been in the past.” Hiding among the protesters were“disrupters”who threw dangerous objects at police and targeted them with lasers, the report noted, in a level of violence that“had not been seen at demonstrations in years.”Yet it faults the LAPD leadership for not being“proactive”about containing the groups whose objective was to“create chaos and confrontation with the police,”among other things. The Chaleff report reveals that some groups of looters“appeared to be well coordinated,”using scouts and“convoys of up to ten cars”to target a location, only to move elsewhere when police responded. Other groups that directly targeted police for violence were“dramatically”different from such rioters in the past, more violent and better organized. They threw“bricks and concrete blocks, using firecrackers or explosive devices, and pointing lasers at officers’ eyes.” Another part of the report talks about the“unrelenting”use of lasers in both LA and places“such asPortland,”as well as“containers filled with urine, frozen water bottles, and caustic chemicals such as bleach.”LAPD reported that 106 officers were injured during the riots. “The Department must do everything it can to provide for officer safety and at the same time protect the safety of those who are peacefully protesting,”the report said, without specifying as to how. LAPD did not establish a command post until May 30 and the first field jail until June 2. More than 4,000 people were arrested between May 29 and June 2 – many of whom have sued the city claiming that under municipal code, they should have only been issued a citation and released. There was also“chaos of command”as officers often received conflicting orders from their superiors. Chaleff and his team found that LAPD had lost nearly half of its senior command staff between 2018 and 2020, leaving it without leadership skilled in“public order policing,”as riot control is now called. The rank and file were also not properly trained in riot control techniques, including the“problematic”deployment of 40mm riot guns, as the dynamics of their use“dramatically change in a crowd control situation when the person engaging in the criminal behavior is not standing still.” The report cited a survey by the Los Angeles Police Protective League showing the department’s morale is close to rock bottom. More than 99 percent of officers do not feel supported by the mayor or the city council, while 86.33 percent do not feel supported by the LAPD leadership. The report made 67 recommendations to the city council,  but the chief among them was to create a high-level position of a“Strategic Emergency Manager”within the LAPD. This displeased blacklivesmatter activists, however, who called it undue criminalization of peaceful protests. What the report“doesn’t do is really critique the notion that LAPD should be putting down righteous protests in the first place,”Melina Abdullah, co-founder of BLM-LA, told the Los Angeles Times.

"10 Mar, 2021","Bodyguards for me, none for thee? America’s ‘progressive’ legislators demand the security they want taken from their constituents","With the US Capitol building locked down like a military fortress and no end of this police-state model in sight, the hypocrisy of ‘defund the police’ types compared to their public personas becomes all too obvious. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram It seems they are riddled with lingering stress from that scary moment two months ago when a horde of unarmed demonstrators – mostly fans of then-president Donald Trump – demanded Congress “stop the steal” and thronged congressional offices. Not only were they allowed into the building while the House was debating whether to certify November’s election results, they were permitted to explore it almost completely on their own, grabbing a souvenir or two along the way, as Capitol police officers tasked with guarding the building appeared to stand down. While the chief of the Capitol force Steven Sund did resign in disgrace shortly after the raid, Congress wasn t done extracting pain-and-suffering demands from DC law enforcement. Just as the optimistic energy of former president Barack Obama’s campaign – with all its “hope” and “change” – was soon squelched under the shiny new boots worn by the president’s Citigroup-appointed cabinet and the determination of the political class to bail out Wall Street, the ascension of Joe Biden – stalwart of mediocrity and corporate-beloved moderate – fell away in just a few days to reveal a career politician whose twin favorite pastimes seem to be making war and making women uncomfortable. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed the House almost unanimously last week, not only banning chokeholds but also the practice of “qualified immunity,” which typically prevents police from being arrested, let alone indicted or jailed, should they kill or maim someone while on duty.The bill also seeks to impose a national policing standard designed to boost the accountability that remains lacking. Despite the arrival of body cameras and other equipment intended to counter criticism that police forces – especially those in urban areas – are being permitted to run roughshod over Americans’ civil liberties, the level of cartoonish violence often seen on US streets has not noticeably improved. That’s not all, however. On Monday, retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré filed a report that found Capitol Police to be too “understaffed, insufficiently equipped, and inadequately trained” – to say nothing of being “woefully lacking in intelligence capabilities.” Far from going with the “less is more” approach supposedly favored by defunding enthusiasts, the retired officer called for an extra 854 Capitol Police appointees alone. The unit’s new police director, Yogananda Pittman, has already put in a request for a 21 percent personnel addition, displeasing high-level Republicans like California Rep. and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of “turning the Capitol into a fortress,” while the usual “defund the police” suspects like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez politely followed evacuation orders, only later deciding they’d feared for their lives,attemptingto have their police-brutality cake and eat it too. With the federal area of Washington DC staked out as a terror warning zone through April, it certainly does seem like a fortress, with mammoth curls of barbed wire sitting on top of the fence. And that security theatre isn’t going anywhere, either – not when Honoré observed the police need to be able to take “immediate action and appropriations where appropriate [sic].” The Lt. Gen. had plenty of ideas for beefing up security in a manner no civilian would be able to emulate. Describing a “retractable fencing system” to be permanently established around the Capitol and Congressional offices, he also called for more comprehensive camera coverage and an integrated permit system for accessing different parts of the buildings. Never mind that none of this should be necessary, given that the Capitol Police charged with monitoring the buildings or apprehending unauthorized individuals simply opted to let them through on January 6. There’s no accounting for human error, especially if – as some have suggested – the decision to hold back the Capitol Police and let the Trump fans do (comparatively little) damage inside was even an error at all. With Biden and Kamala Harris rolling up their sleeves to go after the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, it would be all but impossible to secure a vote in favor of gun control unless the populace had been negatively primed for the issue – say, by being told about the “armed insurrection” taking place at the White House, for example, or reminded of school shooting victims via creepy holograms. With the First Amendment and its guarantee of free speech stuffed into the epistemological paper-shredder, and the Fourth Amendment’s rights to be free of unlawful search and seizure having been trampled into the ground by botched police raid after botched police raid, there are just a few rights left to be shredded. But not for Congress, of course. That would just be weird. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/517718-defund-police-hypocrisy-capitol-raid/
"8 Mar, 2021",WATCH: Minneapolis battens down the hatches with extreme security ahead of trial of George Floyd’s alleged killer,"Authorities in Minneapolis have erected steel fencing, barbed wire and concrete barricades outside the city’s courthouse and local police stations ahead of the Derek Chauvin trial, set to begin Monday. The former police officer will stand trial for the May 25 killing of George Floyd in an incident which rocked the US to its core and triggered months of unrest and billions of dollar’s worth of damage. An estimated 15 million to 26 million people participated in blacklivesmatter protests in the US in the aftermath of Floyd s death. Armored personnel carriers have been deployed and local Minneapolis police stations have all been fortified in anticipation of further protests as Chauvin s trial is set to commence with jury selection. The proceedings are expected to last two months, and preparations for the trial have been ongoing for the past seven months. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and local government officials have developed a plan, dubbed“Operation Safety Net,”designed to avoid a return to the violence which swept the country in summer 2020 and saw buildings burned, widespread vandalism, looting and numerous deaths. The stated aims of the operation are the prevention of crime and damage to property and the protection of the First Amendment right to protest and peaceful assembly. Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Binder claimed that“law enforcement escalated”the violence last summer and“created the conditions for folks to come from outside our community to cause more harm.” “I don t think that we can police ourselves out of police violence,”she added. Ben Crump, an attorney who represents the Floyd family, cited onereportby the US Crisis Project, which found that 95 percent of the roughly 10,600 blacklivesmatter protests between Floyd s death in late May and August 22 were peaceful. “This will be a referendum on whether police are held accountable for killing black people in America in 2021,”Crump said, adding that the Floyd family expects Chauvin to be convicted of“torturing George Floyd to death.” However, according to a report by the City Assessor’s Office, the estimated damage caused by the unrest in Minneapolis alone is between $250 million and $350 million. Meanwhile, areportby Verisk Property Claims Service issued in November estimated the total cost of the national unrest in the wake of George Floyd s death as surpassing $2 billion, the most since such records began. For context, the PCS estimates the insured losses caused by the Rodney King riots in 1992 at $775 million. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/517487-minneapolis-preparations-derek-chauvin-trial/
"7 Mar, 2021",New York Times mocked for attempting to downplay 2020 BLM protest violence as ‘misinformation’,"The New York Times has been lambasted online for bizarrely claiming that violence surrounding blacklivesmatter protests in 2020 was merely “misinformation” and likening it to Deep State conspiracy theories. The Gray Lady’s Jennifer Medina sought to unravel the mystery behind Latinos in the US voting Republican, in a Fridayarticletitled:“A Vexing Question for Democrats: What Drives Latino Men to Republicans?” Medina teased out the motivations of Latino Republicans through a series of interviews, before attempting to conflate the notion that the “deep state” had taken over the government during the Trump administration or that“ blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence,”dismissing both ideas as “misinformation” within the same breath. “Some of the frustrations voiced by Hispanic Republican men are stoked by misinformation, including conspiracy theories claiming that the deep state took over during the Trump administration and a belief that blacklivesmatter protests caused widespread violence.” Needless to say, the ever-watchful eye of Twitter did not let this claim about widespread violence slide. One Twitter user was blunt in his analysis:“The New York Times is lying.” The New York Times is lying.pic.twitter.com/3w1AP02B1Q Others criticized the ‘paper of record’ for using weasel words to detract from the gravity and scale of the violence witnessed throughout the BLM protests across the US in 2020. Has anybody noticed that the lying media slips in the weasel word “widespread” whenever it wants to hand you a bunch of bullshit? Widespread can mean anything, so no matter how much looting and rioting were done by BLM, the NYTs will say it wasn’t enough to be “widespread.” According toForbes, between George Floyd’s death at the hands of the Minneapolis police department on May 25 and June 8, 2020, at least 19 people died during the protests. There were many injuries and hospitalizations on both sides of the security barricades throughout the protests and riots which took place across the US in 2020.

"6 Mar, 2021","BLM backfire? US public opinion shifts on George Floyd s death, law & order, as racial divide widens after summer of riots – poll","US public opinion on the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody has shifted since the early days of last year s blacklivesmatter protests, with trust in law enforcement growing after violent unrest in the streets. Just 36 percent of respondents in a USA Today/Ipsospollreleased on Friday described Floyd s death as murder, down from 60 percent last June. The racial divide in how the May 25 tragedy is viewed is startling, with 64 percent of black poll participants and just 28 percent of whites saying Floyd was murdered. The 24-point plunge in public confidence that Floyd was murdered comes to light just three days before Derek Chauvin, the police officer who was shown on video kneeling on Floyd s neck, is scheduled to go to trial on murder and manslaughter charges. The shift came amid a decline in the BLM movement s credibility and rising trust of law enforcement, and both of those trends coincided with riots across the nation. Public trust in BLM has dropped to 50 percent this month from 60 percent last June, the poll showed. Just 42 percent of white respondents said they trusted BLM. Trust in police and local law enforcement swung conversely, rising to 69 percent, including 77 percent of whites and 42 percent of blacks. But while the racial divide is wide, public opinion has shifted against BLM among both white and black Americans. According to the poll, trust in BLM has dropped 12 percentage points among black people since last June, while trust in the police has jumped 14 points. The percentage of white people who trust BLM fell by eight points, while their trust in police rose 12 points. Along the same lines, Americans were about equally divided on the relative importance of protest rights and law and order last June. At the time, 45 percent said ensuring law and order was more important, and 44 percent said the right to protest is more vital. In the latest poll, 49 percent of respondents favored law and order, while 31 percent said protest rights were more important. The racial divide was evident on that question, too, with whites favoring law and order and blacks prioritizing protest rights. One point on which everyone agreed was the deterioration of race relations in the country. Forty percent of respondents said race relations have worsened, while just 13 percent said they have improved. Among blacks, 54 percent said race relations have gotten worse, and only 10 percent saw improvement. Despite the wide variance in opinions on the cause of Floyd s death and support for law enforcement, 60 percent of Americans want to see Chauvin convicted, including 54 percent of white respondents and 76 percent of blacks. That agreement remains despite increasing numbers of Americans believing that Floyd died as a result of police negligence or by accident. Defense lawyers for the officer havearguedthat Floyd died from an overdose of fentanyl and methamphetamine, as well as heart disease. He told officers,“I can t breathe”as they tried to put him in a squad car, which was before he was pinned on the pavement. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/517376-blm-public-opinion-poll/

Seth Jahn, a former member of the US seven-a-side Paralympic team, was speaking in opposition to the policy which was put in place in support of United States football superstar Megan Rapinoe s decision to follow the lead of ex-NFL player Colin Kaepernick by carrying out silent""kneeling""protests before games. The United States Soccer Federation voted at the weekend to repeal the 2017 law which required players to stand for the playing of national anthem, with more than 70% of votes supporting the motion to remove it. Jahn was highly critical of the mooted move, which he said he saw as part of a wider campaign which has been popularized by the woke mob in recent months. US Soccer s members have voted to repeal a 2017 rule that required players to stand during the national anthem.pic.twitter.com/mvebm43a5E The vote – 71% in favor with only a simply majority required – directly followed this sensational seven-minute dissent by Seth Jahn, a US Paralympian who is a current member US Soccer Athlete Council.pic.twitter.com/vH4Pc4vkT4 ""I’m sure I’m going to ruffle some feathers with what I’m about to say, especially given the athletes council that I’mon,""the 38-year-old accepted at the outset of his impassioned address. ""But given the evolution of our, quote-unquote, progressive culture, where everything offends everybody, those willing to take a knee our for anthem don’t care about defending half of our country and, when they do so, then I don’t have too much concern in also exercising my First Amendment right. ""We’re here to get a different perspective. I also feel compelled to articulate that I’m of mixed race and representative of undoubtedly the most persecuted people in our country’s history, Native-Americans."" The wave of pre-match kneeling protests was popularized by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 and has since become a feature of many sporting events around the world amid a broader debate on race relations and police brutality. The movement was amplified further following the death of unarmed African-American man George Floyd in police custody last year, with cell phone footage of the incident sparking numerous bouts of social unrest in the United States.

""Every race in the history of mankind has been enslaved by another demographic at some point in time,"" Jahn continued. ""Blacks have been enslaved. Hispanics have been enslaved. Asians most recently in our country in the freaking 20th century, have been enslaved. ""Natives have been enslaved. Whites have been enslaved. Shoot, I lived in Africa for two-and-a-half years where I could purchase people, slaves, between the price of $300 and $800 per person per head depending on their age, health and physicality. ""Where were the social justice warriors and the news journalists there to bring their ruminations to these real atrocities? And yet in all of history, only one country has fought to abolish slavery: the United States of America, where nearly 400,000 men died to fight for the abolishment of slavery underneath the same stars and bars that our athletes take a knee for. Their sacrifice is tainted with every knee that touches the ground."" My apology letter:pic.twitter.com/QLaHhjXDfn Jahn added that he welcomed athletes rights to have their voices heard, but suggested they do so in their personal time and not while representing the US in international sporting events. Speaking after Jahn, USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone quickly cut down his points.""This is not about disrespecting the flag or about disrespecting the military,"" she said. ""This is about the athletes and our staff’s right to peacefully protest racial inequalities and police brutality."" Jahn s removal was revealed in a statement on Sunday, when the federation found that he had“violated the prohibited conduct’s policy section on harassment, which prohibits racial or other harassment based upon a person’s protected status (race), including any verbal act in which race is used or implied in a manner which would make a reasonable person uncomfortable."" Jahn, who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan three times and injured in 2010, was indignant at his expulsion. ""I will never apologize for the statements I made and will never bow down to the mob mentality of intimidation, bullying or the social media warrior’s gestapo tactics,"" he promised. ""I’m embarrassed to represent a hypocritical federation that conducts a complete assault on diversity of thought without even seeking clarifying statements from me in their smear campaign. ""I’m embarrassed at the cowardice of so-called friends who bent over to the mob, knowing very well the quality of my character, in order to preserve their own image.

A post shared by 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐡 𝐉𝐚𝐡𝐧 (@sethjahn_ix) The 2016 paralympics player made a qualifying remark.""The one point I will clarify is that when I stated that a small percentage of people in our country are responsible for the terrors of slavery hundreds of years ago, of which more than 400,000 men died to abolish under our nation’s flag, I was in no way minimizing the horrors of slavery,""he pointed out.

"25 Feb, 2021",Why Black Lives REALLY Matter: Corporate America is fueling race war to deflect attention from massive wealth inequality,"Racial strife in the US today is not a ‘grassroots phenomenon’ born out of exasperated relations between blacks and whites. It is a manufactured crisis being foisted upon the public at a time when populist ideas are in the air. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Ask the average person on Main Street to describe the biggest news story of 2020 and the blacklivesmatter (BLM) protests will probably take a close second place just behind the Covid-19 pandemic. That answer, however, is more of a reflection of the US media’s unmatched power for shaping the public narrative than an honest assessment of the real problems confronting Americans. Indeed, far more worrisome than racial tensions, and a virus with a 99.75 percent survival rate, is the colossal transfer of wealth to the golden 0.01 percent. Ever since Covid-19 made landfall in January of 2020, America’s 664 billionaires saw their collective worthexplodeto $4.2 trillion, a staggering 44 percent increase from just one year earlier. If ever there was a media story worth pursuing this was it. After all, that historic money grab was fueled by millions of hardworking Americans suddenly being ordered to shelter in place as their small businesses went up in proverbial flames. At the same time, monster companies like Amazon,WalMartand Louis Vuitton, ranked“essential”and apparently impervious to pandemic, happily filled the void. The gatekeepers have gone berserk. They want to gate keep your front door, the door to the restaurant, the schoolhouse steps, the porch of the church, the entry to the capitol, your access to online platforms, and even your mouth and nostrils. Next up: the zipper of your pants Instead of providing a critical assessment of that corporate takeover, the media ran defense for the robber barons, indulging the CEOs as though they were Roman emperors returning home in triumph from military plunder abroad. US News & World Report, for example, apparently confusing the outbreak of a deadly disease with a sporting event,calledguys like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates“the biggest winners of the coronavirus pandemic.”So much for critical journalism. Incidentally, the reason it was deemed necessary for small business owners to lay down and play dead, the ‘experts’ crowed, was to“save grandma”from the ravages of Covid-19 (in the most consequential presidential election cycle in many decades, no less). Yet, strangely, nobody bothered to ask grandma her opinion on the matter, nor did such concerns prevent infected senior citizens from beingdispatchedto nursing homes, which quickly became the main incubator for coronavirus deaths in the nation. But I digress. As cruel fate would have it, at the same time that the already insanely rich were counting their newfound bullion, George Floyd had the life crushed out of him under the knee of a white police officer. At this point, the media industrial complex could have navigated that tragedy into safe harbor, away from a proverbial shit storm, or straight into the rocks. Predictably, it chose the latter course, blaming Floyd’s death on ‘systemic racism,’ as opposed to other more probable explanations, likepoorly trainedandoverworkedpolice officers who are simply unprepared for the myriad challenges they face every day on the job. What followed was a prime example of the elite, with the complicity of the media, actively promoting civil strife to conceal the rapidly growing wealth divide. Race panic intensifying. No end in sight.https://t.co/nn9Fi7LDab US corporations – the very same entities that were doing gangbuster business amid the pandemic – beganstuffingthe war chests of various social justice groups, notably blacklivesmatter . The financier George Soros, who never met a social uprising he didn’t like, alsoopenedhis wallet to the tune of $220 million. The question must be asked: why would corporations sponsor BLM at the very same time the latter was destroying and looting Main Street, USA as part of their“mostly peaceful”protests? Wouldn’t those donations have been better spent rebuilding the urban centers and SMALL BUSINESSES across the nation that BLM ransacked? Perhaps, but that would have clashed with the media-forged narrative, predicated on the myth of ‘systemic racism,’ that is working to deflect attention away from an anti-establishment mood that has settled on the nation. Another method being employed to foment racial tensions is known as ‘critical race theory (CRT), by far one of the most sinister ideas to emerge from the liberal asylum of academia in a long time. In a nutshell, CRT postulates the notion that all white people, even if they don’t know it, have an inborn sense of racial superiority, which manifests itself in racism, the oppression of minority groups and card-carrying membership in some white supremacist group (at this point, take a moment and ask yourself how many ‘white supremacists’ you know). Banned by Donald Trump last year after it was discovered that CRT was being taught to government employees, President Joe Biden made it one of his first acts as president toreinstatethe radical progressive legislation. Wut.... this seems like blatant racial discrimination to this employment lawyer.https://t.co/IEmpycTP6P Now CRT is back in the spotlight with a vengeance. Just this month it was discovered that Coca-Cola isinstructingits employees to“be less white,”while a Buffalo, New York school district announced it willteachits pupils that“all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.”In short, here we have another one of those radical progressive ideas, much like the transgender movement, which is based more on raw emotions and feelings than any sound science. After all, are black people free of the purported chromosome that has motivated the loathsome white man to oppress minority groups over the centuries? Well, when it is considered that America’s first black president, Barack Obama,droppedover 26,000 bombs on seven foreign countries in his last year in office, while a number of other African Americans, including, but not limited to,Condoleezza Rice,Colin PowellandSusan Ricehave also been very casual about oppressing and killing foreigners, then the so-called ‘science’ behind CRT looks more like sheer quackery. So, what is really going on with regards to race relations in the United States? It is the opinion here, as stated earlier, that the elite, in an effort to deflect attention away from the greatest wealth heist in US history, are hyping ‘systemic racism’ lest the people start asking pesky questions about economic justice, which is certainly in shorter supply now than ever before. Thus, there is a concerted effort by corporations, media, academia and even Hollywood to arouse tensions between blacks and whites when in reality there is very little. That’s certainly not to suggest that racism does not exist in the United States. Of course it does. But to believe that it has reached epidemic levels is simply outlandish and unsupported by the realities on the ground. A rising tide of populism is swelling in the United States and the elite will do absolutely everything in its power, up to and including aggravating racial tensions, to keep the torches and pitchforks at bay.

Millions upon millions of dollars of damage was done, lives were lost, all the while a chant of blacklivesmatter was ringing through the air. The organization who has made the chant its name raked in more than $90 millionin 2020. At the same time, we find people still chanting for the defunding of police. Here in my home state of Illinois, our governor has just signed a bill that will make it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs properly. The new law bans chokeholds, and does not allow police officers to purchase what the governor and the Democrats define as military equipment. These things include firearms of .50 caliber or higher and tracked armored vehicles. Given that caliber of round is largely only used in anti-materiel rifles, and Illinois police don t have a tendency to use actual tanks, the ban makes the ‘problem’ look bigger than it is. It s not just the letter of the law that is foolish, but the spirit as well. That and the massive amount of money that BLM has brought in show two sides of a sickness plaguing the United States. To put it plainly, there does not exist a single argument to defend police brutality. The problem is blaming the wrong thing for a larger issue. Similar to the mistake made by Chicago activist Early Walker in his push to ban the video game Grand Theft Auto, Americans are blaming military equipment and chokeholds for issues and situations where those were not the problem. There isn t a place where police are gunning down people with anti-materiel rifles and running them over with armored vehicles. We re not a nation that s having a Tiananmen Square issue. We are in a place where bad cops need to be dealt with harshly, all the while not punishing the police officers who work diligently to protect their communities. Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of George Floyd showed a bad cop doing his job badly. Applying a chokehold does not necessarily show a cop doing his job badly. I very much believe bad cops should be punished, but is the hold the problem? Is the equipment the problem? Of course not. These are scapegoats that will solve nothing when banned, and in many situations the equipment and training that is available saves lives far more than it takes them. When a police officer is told that he could not use a rear naked choke to restrain a subject that is trying to harm him, you take away his options to protect his own life and the lives of others around him. The same can be said of certain bits of equipment used. But I wouldn t expect a politician to understand that. On top of that realization, where does that put the police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect the community? What message does that send to them? Where does that say our values are? It goes without saying that police should have accountability to the citizens, but it also goes without saying that we shouldn t be rewarding the people who don t defend the neighborhoods. It certainly doesn t incentivize people to become police officers, and it disenfranchises those who are already working the beat. A serious decision needs to be made in America. We as citizens need to decide whether or not we truly value our communities. Do we value them enough to be smarter about these situations? Do we value them enough to enable the people who want places to improve, and seek for the people who burn our cities to be punished?

Because self-appointed social media commentators, columnists in the liberal press and the noisy throng pushing an unfiltered blacklivesmatter agenda have been insisting for a year now that Britain is in thrall to a racist, colonialist, imperialist past and anything that even whiffs of this must be torn down and destroyed or shamefully hidden in the basements of our museums never to see the light of day again. But areportby the Henry Jackson Society, entitledBLM: A Voice for all Black Britons?found a clear majority of Britain s black community find the whole idea of statue toppling and other BLM goals at odds with how they actually feel. The think tank found that only one in six black Britons believe tearing down a statue is a legitimate form of protest, according to polling conducted for its report. As for the BLM’s other stated goals of dismantling“imperialism, capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy and the state structures that disproportionately harm black people in Britain,”well, they have a similar level of support among the black community (25 percent) as they do among the wider population (23 percent). The question, therefore, has to be asked: With more than three quarters of the country holding an opposite view to what underpins their student-level politics and obsessive victimhood, who or what does BLM represent? Like so many hard-left organisations, BLM wants to be everything to everyone and in doing so has lost sight of the people and the cause that it first claimed to champion. Just check out theirwebsiteif you want proof. Riding in the slipstream of the powerful US pioneers of BLM, who had serious and legitimate causes for concern over racism brought to a boil with the death of George Floyd, the UK offshoot managed to stir up public sentiment towards the police but nowhere near the extent that it managed to raise the mob against statues. The sight of white men rolling a bronze likeness of a long-dead Edward Colston along the street to be dumped in Bristol harbour was as ridiculous as it was puzzling. What did this have to do with BLM? The Henry Jackson poll seems to show that the majority of Britain’s black community were not okay with trashing history and promoting cancel culture. Quite the reverse, in fact. And when it came to using violence against the police, even less support was evident, at just five percent. While it remains difficult to pin down who exactly is in charge of BLM in the UK or what they actually do, there were rumblings of activity last week as a slew of disparate groups were announced as beneficiaries as the organisation distributed half the £1.2 million in donations it received from itscrowdfunding site last year. Among recipients there was cash for police monitoring services, a domestic violence organisation, an outfit that deals with LGBTQI refugees and asylum seekers, and a charity that helps those affected by cancer, long-term health conditions and Covid-19. All worthy causes, no doubt, but I find it hard to believe that these are the intended beneficiaries that people were donating their hard-earned cash towards last summer. Most donors at that time would have imagined their money going to the families of young black men who had died at the hands of white policemen. In Britain. The problem with that belief is that while these cases do exist, they are not that common. Our law enforcement system is a long way from perfect but it is streets ahead of what they have in the USA, largely because the police here are mainly unarmed which drastically reduces the tension during arrest or even stop and search. Add a gun to the mix and a life can be taken in an instant. In the absence of victims from police brutality, BLM has spread its charity far and wide even beyond the shores of Great Britain, to a Spanish labour union and a South African shack dwellers’ movement. All things to everyone. This should wake up the woke institutions like the National Trust and theBritish Museum, who swallowed the BLM agenda hook, line and sinker, and couldn’t shutter historical landmarks or cart off colonial artefacts to Big Yellow Storage quick enough lest the culture police start banging on the door. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has told them to lift their game and ensure they continue to give a rounded view of Britain’s history instead of, asone ministerput it, bowing to the wishes of“town hall militants and woke worthies.” Now, thanks to this timely intervention from the DCMS and the Henry Jackson Society report, there may be a reset on the toxic and divisive public conversation that has preoccupied many over the last year and we can leave those statues of Winston Churchill, Francis Drake and Horatio Nelson in situ. After all, as most people agree, they are fine just where they are. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/516491-blm-race-baiting-police-statues-uk/
"22 Feb, 2021",‘Taking the knee can’t change systemic racism’: Ex-footballer John Barnes supports players deciding not to kneel (VIDEO),"John Barnes admits taking the knee can t ""change systemic racism"" and supports players finding alternatives, believing focus should be on combatting socio-political discrimination rather than isolated incidents of racial abuse. ByDanny Armstrong Danny Armstrong is a Moscow-based British journalist, reporter and presenter for RT Sport. Follow him on Twitter@DannyWArmstrong Barnes’ career with Liverpool, where he was twice a league winner, and England inspired generations of youngsters and future footballers, and at the time of his retirement from international football he had won more England caps than any other black player with 79 appearances for the Three Lions. The 57-year-old has been vocal on the issue of systematic racism that he believes has pervaded sporting institutions and the impact on sport of worldwide protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020. In the wake of Floyd s death, the English Premier League adopted the gesture of taking a knee before kick off, aiming to promote racial equality and show solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement. The decision was almost unanimously accepted but did not come without its detractors. Several high-profile figures, including Crystal Palace’s Wilfred Zaha, labeled the action“degrading”and insisted black players should instead“stand tall”.Championship teams Bournemouth and Brentford announced in club statements they would no longer partake in the custom, saying it had“run its course”. Les Ferdinand, a former England teammate of Barnes and now director of football at London team Queens Park Rangers – one of the first clubs to discontinue the action – said taking the knee had""been diluted""and dismissed it as a fad similar to a""fancy hashtag"". In an interview with RT Sport, Barnes agreed the gesture""cannot change systematic racism""and said he encourages players in all sports to find other avenues to do more than replicate a token gesture to highlight the issue within the game. “First of all, taking the knee highlights the problem, and it s been highlighting the problems since the George Floyd situation,""Barnes told RT Sport via Zoom. ""That s all. We can t do anything to change people s perceptions.Taking a knee, walking off or appealing or refusing to play can t change systematic racism when you have a policeman who is going to stop or shoot a black person because his perception of him, unconsciously or not, is that he s a crook. “He s not going to think to himself, if I shoot or stop this black person, the LA Lakers aren’t gonna play basketball so I m not going to do it. So all sport can do, because it s media tentative and high-profile, is highlight the problem. ""Now, we ve been highlighting the problem in the Champions League, passing it around the line saying no to racism for 15 years. And nothing has changed. “So if people feel that all they can do is highlight it, then take a knee. But if they feel they want to do more and taking a knee is a token gesture – and in many respects it is just a token gesture – if they decide not to do it because they want to do something else, I m fine [with that]. ""I wouldn t be taking a knee.However, I don t say that people shouldn t be taking a knee. But taking a knee does nothing apart from highlight the problem."" Barnes was careful to make the distinction between focussing on isolated events of racism and racial inequality, and insisted the finer details of discrimination lie much more deeply, such as the lack of available education for black people in the poorer, inner-city areas. Racism in football has been apparent in pockets of support such as when England’s UEFA 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia in 2019 was twice halted after the home section was infiltrated by neo-fascist groups who made monkey chants and Nazi salutes at England’s black players. Another more prevalent but less easily manageable problem has emerged on social media, where a number of players, including Manchester United’s Anthony Martial, Arsenal’s Willian and Swansea City’s Yan Dhanda, were among those racially abused on Twitter and Instagram after poor performances for their club. Barnes believes the problem is much deeper and says that the energy used to focus on numerous isolated incidents would be better centered on the root cause of the issue. He suggests opening a dialogue on socio-economic problems minorities face, as well as black-on-black violence in the inner-cites. “We have to analyze or decide what we think racial inequality is. Black kids in the inner cities can t get an education, access to housing, social care and jobs and are discriminated against every single day as they walk down the street. For me, that s racial inequality,""he said. “Now, while that s what we should focus on, we should also try to stamp out racist incidents as we see them. But for that black player who talks about racial inequality, who for six days of the week, six-and-a-half days of the week, can go to the front of any line in front of white people can get into any club, any restaurant will have doors open for him – is that racial inequality? “So we have to decide what we believe racial equality to be and what our focus has to be, from a planning perspective and a sporting perspective. “There are enough elite people talking about getting Bulgaria banned and getting some idiots off social media. How many people are talking about the real problem where kids are killing each other in inner-cities every single day? “We ve got to stamp out bananas [being thrown] on the field, but we seem to be not only highlighting but focusing all our energy and money on trying to get Bulgaria banned and trying to get a 12-year-old football fan sent to prison or trying to get some idiot who can t spell his own name, who is happy for people to talk about him by going on social media and abusing a black. ""The real problems that are happening in the inner-cities which has kept black people down for hundreds of years and willcontinue to do so which are being ignored. That, for me, is what I m interested in [working on].” One prominent figure in the fight against inequality is Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford, who has campaigned for poverty-stricken UK children to receive government subsidized meals during the Covid-19 pandemic. Barnes says more high-profile players such as Rashford should be using their platform to challenge government policy and help black people in the poorer inner-city areas, challenging disproportionate misrepresentation at a fundamental level and within the elite to benefit 99% of blacks, rather than just 1% . “He s the one who s doing it,""Barnes says of Rashford.""He s [saying], forget about race, it s an underprivileged situation whereby black kids are disproportionately represented in that sphere. ""He s talking about trying to change things for them. He s not talking about alternatives for him. And he s not also saying, I m going to give you £20,000 of my own money. “What he s saying is that he can use his platform to change government, principle, government policy, which he has done to then say, we re going to feed inner-city kids throughout the summer holidays. ""Imagine if more black players – not just athletes, superstars – were to do that. That would help 99% of the black community. We re trying to help 1% of the black community, and the elite are not doing that. So that s not what I m about."" As a player who inspired a generation of youngsters regardless of race, Barnes career mirrors that of current star Rashford s in more ways than one, as the two are now engaged in combating socio-political discrimination by using their platforms as prominent sports stars. Barnes thinks to ensure the message is carried to future generations, the focus should remain on making life better in the poorest areas of society. ""It depends on what continues to happen. [Rashford could] continue to look at social issues and take on a stance, saying I am going to try and help the black kids in a city kids in which are disproportionately represented. ""[He could] then say, well, what we need now is more black men in the boardroom, and more black managers ... forget about what s going on the inner cities, forget sports. ""This has been happening for 1,000 years: an elite group of people who wanted more power for themselves have used the people as an excuse to say, I will help the people by me getting more power.

"16 Feb, 2021",Los Angeles police hunt for alleged ‘Valentine’s Day meme’ mocking George Floyd’s death as lawyer demands APOLOGY,"Police in Los Angeles are scouring social media for a photo of George Floyd captioned ‘You take my breath away’ that was reportedly shared among its officers. The lawyer for the African-American man’s family demanded an apology. “This is beyond insult on top of injury – it’s injury on top of death,”attorney Benjamin Crump said in a statement on Monday, demanding an apology and that anyone who is involved with the meme be held accountable.“The type of callousness and cruelty within a person’s soul needed to do something like this evades comprehension – and is indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD.” The statement follows reports over the weekend that someone in the LA police may have passed around a mock Valentine’s Day message featuring an image of Floyd’s face and the questionable caption. A personnel complaint has been initiated and we are pursuing each allegation including interviewing the department member who brought it to our attention. In a series of tweets on Saturday, the LAPD confirmed that someone had complained about the image, and that there was a report it had been created by an employee. “At this point the Department has not identified any actual postings in the workplace or identified that it was in fact our department employee who created the image,”but they have“directed commands to survey the worksites” for any traces of it, the LAPD added, noting that they “will have zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” If found any employee or supervisor is directed to take possession and identify those present. The Department will have zero tolerance for this type of behavior. Police in Minneapolis, Minnesota tried to arrest Floyd at the end of May 2020, following a report that he tried to use a counterfeit banknote at a grocery store. As several officers sought to subdue him, one of them by kneeling on his neck, Floyd complained that he could not breathe. All four officers were fired the very next day and criminally charged over his death. By that point, however, blacklivesmatter protests had become violent and within weeks spread throughout the US and even overseas. Crump has represented families of men shot by police in a number of prominent blacklivesmatter cases, starting with Trayvon Martin in 2013 and continuing with Michael Brown and Tamir Rice in 2014, Terence Crutcher in 2016, as well as Floyd and Jacob Blake in 2020.

"15 Feb, 2021","Chris Hedges: Cancel culture, where liberalism goes to die","Elites and their courtiers who trumpet their moral superiority by damning and silencing those who do not linguistically conform to politically correct speech are the new Jacobins. ByChris Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for The New York Times, where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper. He previously worked overseas for The Dallas Morning News, The Christian Science Monitor, and NPR. He is the host of the Emmy Award-nominated RT America showOn Contact. This article was originally published byScheerPost. The Rev. Will Campbell was forced out of his position as director of religious life at the University of Mississippi in 1956 because of his calls for integration. He escorted black children through a hostile mob in 1957 to integrate Little Rock’s Central High School. He was the only white person that was invited to be part of the group that founded Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He helped integrate Nashville’s lunch counters and organize the Freedom Rides. But Campbell was also, despite a slew of death threats he received from white segregationists, an unofficial chaplain to the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. He denounced and publicly fought the Klan’s racism, acts of terror and violence and marched with black civil rights protesters in his native Mississippi, but he steadfastly refused to “cancel” white racists out of his life. He refused to demonize them as less than human. He insisted that this form of racism, while evil, was not as insidious as a capitalist system that perpetuated the economic misery and instability that pushed whites into the ranks of violent, racist organizations. “During the civil rights movement, when we were developing strategies, someone usually said, ‘Call Will Campbell. Check with Will,’” Rep. John Lewis wrote in the introduction to the new edition of Campbell’s memoir ‘Brother to a Dragonfly’, one of the most important books I read as a seminarian. “Will knew that the tragedy of Southern history had fallen on our opponents as well as our allies … on George Wallace and Bull Connor as well as Rosa Parks and Fred Shuttlesworth. He saw that it had created the Ku Klux Klan as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. That insight led Will to see racial healing and equity, pursued through courage, love, and faith as the path to spiritual liberation for all.” Jimmy Carter wrote of Campbell that he “tore down the walls that separated white and black Southerners.” And because the Black Panther organizer Fred Hampton was doing the same thing in Chicago, the FBI — which, along with the CIA, is the de facto ally of the liberal elites in their war against Trump and his supporters —assassinated him. When the town Campbell lived in decided the Klan should not be permitted to have a float in the Fourth of July parade Campbell did not object, as long as the gas and electric company was also barred. It was not only white racists that inflicted suffering on the innocent and the vulnerable, but institutions that place the sanctity of profit before human life. “People can’t pay their gas and electric bills, the heat gets turned off and they freeze and sometimes die, especially if they are elderly,” he said. “This, too, is an act of terrorism.” “Theirs you could see and deal with, and if they broke the law, you could punish them,” he said of the Klan. “But the larger culture that was, and still is, racist to the core is much more difficult to deal with and has a more sinister influence.” Campbell would have reminded us that the demonization of the Trump supporters who stormed the capital is a terrible mistake. He would have reminded us that racial injustice will only be solved with economic justice. He would have called on us to reach out to those who do not think like us, do not speak like us, are ridiculed by polite society, but who suffer the same economic marginalization. He knew that the disparities of wealth, loss of status and hope for the future, coupled with prolonged social dislocation, generated the poisoned solidarity that give rise to groups such as the Klan or the Proud Boys. We cannot heal wounds we refuse to acknowledge. The Washington Post, whichanalyzed the public recordsof 125 defendants charged with taking part in the storming of the Capital on January 6, found that “nearly 60 percent of the people facing charges related to the Capitol riot showed signs of prior money troubles, including bankruptcies, notices of eviction or foreclosure, bad debts, or unpaid taxes over the past two decades.” “The group’s bankruptcy rate — 18 percent — was nearly twice as high as that of the American public,” the Post found. “A quarter of them had been sued for money owed to a creditor. And 1 in 5 of them faced losing their home at one point, according to court filings.” “A California man filed for bankruptcy one week before allegedly joining the attack, according to public records,” the paper reported. “A Texas man was charged with entering the Capitol one month after his company was slapped with a nearly $2,000 state tax lien. Several young people charged in the attack came from families with histories of financial duress.” We must acknowledge the tragedy of these lives, while at the same time condemning racism, hate and the lust for violence. We must grasp that our most perfidious enemy is not someone who is politically incorrect, even racist, but the corporations and a failed political and judicial system that callously sacrifices people, as well as the planet, on the altar of profit. Like Campbell, much of my own family comes from the rural working class, many espousing prejudices my father, a Presbyterian minister, regularly condemned from the pulpit. Through a combination of luck and scholarships to elite schools, I got out. They never did. My grandfather, intellectually gifted, was forced to drop out of high school his senior year when his sister’s husband died. He had to work the farm to feed her children. If you are poor in America, you rarely get more than one chance. And many do not get one. He lost his. The towns in Maine where my relatives come from have been devastated by the closures of mills and factories. There is little meaningful work. There is a smoldering anger caused by legitimate feelings of betrayal and entrapment. They live, like most working class Americans, lives of quiet desperation. This anger is often expressed in negative and destructive ways. But I have no right to dismiss them as irredeemable. To understand is not to condone. But if the ruling elites, and their courtiers masquerading as journalists, continue to gleefully erase these people from the media landscape, to attack them as less than human, or as Hillary Clinton called them “deplorables,” while at the same time refusing to address the grotesque social inequality that has left them vulnerable and afraid, it will fuel ever greater levels of extremism and ever greater levels of state repression and censorship. The cancel culture, a witch hunt by self-appointed moral arbiters of speech, has become the boutique activism of a liberal class that lacks the courage and the organizational skills to challenge the actual centers of power — the military-industrial complex, lethal militarized police, the prison system, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, the intelligence agencies that make us the most spied upon, watched, photographed and monitored population in human history, the fossil fuel industry, and a political and economic system captured by oligarchic power. It is much easier to turn from these overwhelming battles to take down hapless figures who make verbal gaffes, those who fail to speak in the approved language or embrace the approved attitudes of the liberal elites. These purity tests have reached absurd and self-defeating levels, including the inquisitional bloodlust by 150 staff members of the New York Timesdemanding that management, which had already investigated and dealt with what at most was poor judgment made by the veteran reporter Don McNeil when he repeated a racist slur in a discussion about race, force him out of the paper, which management reluctantly did. Too often the targets of the cancel culture are radicals, such as the feminists who run the Vancouver Rape Relief and Women’s Shelter and who do not admit trans people because most of the girls and women in the shelter have been physically assaulted and traumatized by those with male bodies. None of the critics of these feminists spend ten or twelve hours a day in a shelter taking care of abused girls and women, many of whom were prostituted as children, butfire off screeds to attack them and cut their funding. The cancel culture, as the Canadian feminist Lee Lakeman says, is “the weaponization of ignorance.” The cancel culture was pioneered by the red baiting of the capitalist elites and their shock troops in agencies such as the FBI to break, often through violence, radical movements and labor unions. Tens of thousands of people, in the name of anti-communism, were canceled out of the culture. The well-financed Israel lobbyis a master of the cancel culture, shutting down critics of the Israeli apartheid state and those of us who support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement as anti-Semites. The cancel culture fueled the persecution of Julian Assange, the censorship of WikiLeaks and the Silicon Valley algorithms that steer readers away from content, including my content, critical of imperial and corporate power. In the end, this bullying will be used by social media platforms, which are integrated into the state security and surveillance organs, not to promote, as its supporters argue, civility, but ruthlessly silence dissidents, intellectuals, artists and independent journalism.  Once you control what people say you control what they think. This cancel culture is embraced by corporate media platforms where, as Glenn Greenwald writes, “teams of journalists at three of the most influential corporate media outlets — CNN’s ‘media reporters’ (Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy), NBC’s ‘disinformation space unit’ (Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny), and the tech reporters of The New York Times (Mike Isaac, Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel) — devote the bulk of their ‘journalism’ to searching for online spaces where they believe speech and conduct rules are being violated, flagging them, and then pleading that punitive action be taken (banning, censorship, content regulation, after-school detention).” Corporations know these moral purity tests are, for us, self-defeating. They know that by making the cancel culture legitimate — and for this reason I opposed locking Donald Trump out of his Twitter and other social media accounts — they can employ it to silence those who attack and expose the structures of corporate power and imperial crimes. The campaigns of moral absolutism widen the divides between the liberal elites and the white working class, divisions that are crucial to maintaining the power of the corporate elites. The cancel culture is the fodder for the riveting and entertaining culture wars. It turns anti-politics into politics. Most importantly, the cancel culture deflects attention from the far more egregious institutionalized abuses of power. It is this smug, self-righteousness crusade that makes the liberal class so odious. Doug Marlette, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist who created the comic strip ‘Kudzu’, which featured a Campbell-inspired character called Rev. Will B. Dunn, brought Campbell to speak at Harvard when I was there.  Campbell’s message was met with a mixture of bewilderment and open hostility, which was fine with me as it meant the room swiftly emptied and the rest of the night Marlette, Campbell and I sat up late drinking whiskey and eating bologna sandwiches. Marlette was as iconoclastic and acerbically funny as Campbell. His cartoons, including one that showed Jesus on Good Friday carrying an electric chair instead of a cross and another that portrayed Jerry Falwell as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, provoked howls of protest from irate readers. Campbell’s memoir, ‘Brother to a Dragonfly’, is not only beautifully written — Campbell was a close friend of Walker Percy, whose novels I also consumed — but filled with a humility and wisdom that liberals, who should spend less time in the self-referential rabbit hole of social media, have lost. He describes America, which routinely employs murder, torture, threats, blackmail and intimidation to crush all those who oppose it at home and abroad, as “a nation of Klansmen.” He refused to draw a moral line between the American empire, which many liberals defend, and the disenfranchised and angry whites that flock to racist groups such as the Klan or, years later, would support Trump. The architects of empire and the ruling capitalists who exploited workers, stymied democracy, orchestrated state repression, hoarded obscene levels of wealth and waged endless war were, he knew, the real enemy. Campbell remembers watching a documentary by CBS called The Ku Klux Klan: An Invisible Empire, after which he was invited to address the audience. The film showed the murder of the three civil rights workers in Mississippi, the castration of Judge Aaron in Alabama, and the deaths of the four young girls in the Birmingham Sunday school bombing. When the film showed a Klan recruit pivoting right when the drill master shouted, “Left face,” the audience erupted in “cheers, jeers, catcalls and guffaws.” Campbell writes that he “felt a sickening in my stomach.” Those viewing the film were a group convened by the National Student Association and included New Left radicals of the sixties, representing Students for a Democratic Society, the Port Huron group, young white men and women who had led protests at campuses across the country, burned down buildings, coined the term “pigs” to refer to police. Many were from affluent families. “They were students in or recent graduates of rich and leading colleges and universities,” he writes of the audience. “They were mean and tough but somehow, I sensed that there wasn’t a radical in the bunch. For if they were radical how could they laugh at a poor ignorant farmer who didn’t know his left hand from his right? If they had been radical they would have been weeping, asking what had produced him. And if they had been radical they would not have been sitting, soaking up a film produced for their edification and enjoyment by the Establishment of the establishment — CBS.” Campbell, who was asked to address the group following the film, said: “My name is Will Campbell. I’m a Baptist preacher. I’m a native of Mississippi. And I’m pro-Klansman because I’m pro-human being.” Pandemonium erupted in the hall. He was shouted down as a “fascist pig” and a “Mississippi redneck.” Most walked out. “Just four words uttered — ‘pro-Klansman Mississippi Baptist preacher,’ coupled with one visual image, white, had turned them into everything they thought the Ku Klux Klan to be — hostile, frustrated, angry, violent and irrational,” he writes. “And I was never able to explain to them that pro-Klansman is not the same as pro-Klan. That the former has to do with a person, the other with an ideology.” “The same social forces which produced the Klan’s violence also produced the violence in Watts, Rochester and Harlem, Cleveland, Chicago, Houston, Nashville, Atlanta and Dayton, because they are all pieces of the same garment — social isolation, deprivation, economic conditions, rejections, working mothers, poor schools, bad diets, and all the rest,” Campbell writes. And these social forces produced the nationwide blacklivesmatter protests after the police murder of George Floyd and the storming of the Capitol by an enraged mob. Campbell never asked any of the members of the Klan he knew to leave the organization for the same reason he never asked liberals to leave “the respectable and fashionable organizations or institutions of which they were a part and party, all of which, I was learning, were more truly racist than their Klan.” This radical love was the core of Dr. Martin Luther King’s message. This love informed King’s steadfast nonviolence. It led him to denounce the Vietnam War and condemn the US government as “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” And it saw him assassinated in Memphis when he was supporting a strike by sanitation workers for economic justice. Campbell lived by his oft-quoted creed, “If you’re gonna love one, you’ve got to love ‘em all.”  Like King, he  believed in the redemptive and transformative power of forgiveness. The ruling elites and the courtiers who trumpet their moral superiority by damning and silencing those who do not linguistically conform to politically correct speech are the new Jacobins. They wallow in a sanctimonious arrogance, one made possible by their privilege, which masks their subservience to corporate power and their amorality. They do not battle social and economic injustice. They silence, with the enthusiastic assistance of the digital platforms in Silicon Valley, those who are crushed and deformed by systems of oppression and those who lack their finely developed politesse and deference to linguistic fashion. They are the useful idiots of corporate power and the emerging police state. Cancel culture is not the road to reform. It is the road to tyranny.

"15 Feb, 2021","Minneapolis releases $6.4mn to police to hire new recruits, as depleted force struggles with soaring crime after calls to defund","The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to give police an extra $6.4 million in funding to hire new officers amid a steep increase in violent crime. Dozens of officers quit or went on leave after the George Floyd protests. The City Council voted on Friday to greenlight the release of funds from a Public Safety Staffing Reserve Fund which was set up last year. Police called on lawmakers to boost their budget, citing a lack of officers to deal with the wave of violent crime, as the number of people suffering gunshots wounds grew 250 percent in the first three weeks of the year compared to last year. The number of rapesincreasedby 22 percent and robberies surged by 59 percent. The worrying trends come against the backdrop of an increasingly understaffed force. The Minneapolis Police Department said that around 60 officers left the department last year. Moreover, out of 817 currently employed, only 638 can be deployed to action – 155 officers remain on medical leave, largely due to PTSD, which they claim they experienced following the protests against the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd at the hands of police in May, which spiraled into riots and led to the burning of the police precinct. Some have resigned this year. The exodus coincided with calls to defund the police – one of the rallying cries of the blacklivesmatter protesters – which werebackedby several progressive Democratic lawmakers, including US Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Late last year, the head of the Minneapolis Police Department’s crime investigation unit, Charlie Adams,reportedthat 41 percent of homicide cases are being solved on average, a drop from over 50 percent before the force was hit with staff shortages. The move by council members – some of whom publiclycalledfor the police to be defunded anddisbandedat the height of the George Floyd protests, suggesting they could be replaced with a ‘public safety department’ – comes after they voted unanimously in December to cut $8 million from the police department. City Council member Steve Fletcher praised the move to slash the budget at the time, calling it“a big step forward into a more compassionate and effective public safety future.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/515571-minneapolis-police-extra-funding/
"13 Feb, 2021",‘Why must I kneel down?’ Premier League star Zaha calls blacklivesmatter ‘degrading’ as he slams football’s ‘tick box’ tokenism,"Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha has hit out at the ongoing blacklivesmatter protests in English football, saying that it is ""degrading"" to kneel before each game without seeing any real substantive culture change. The Ivory Coast international has been a target for social media trolls - including from a 12-year-old boy - amid the ongoing debate about online racial abuse and says that he has grown weary of the pre-game ritual of taking a knee prior to kick-off, which was designed to demonstrate that black players matter just as much as their white counterparts. The 28-year-old ex-Manchester United player also slammed football authorities for endorsing the protests so vigorously when, he says, it hasn t led to any meaningful change within the sport. ""The whole kneeling down - why must I kneel down for you to show that we matter?"" Zaha told theOn The Judypodcast. A post shared by Wilfried Zaha (@wilfriedzaha) ""Why must I even wear blacklivesmatter on the back of my top to show you that we matter? This is all degrading stuff."" blacklivesmatter protests have been commonplace in English football since the death early last summer of African-American man George Floyd while in police custody. Cell phone footage shot of the incident ignited a furious racial debate in the United States - much of which has continued in European sport. But Zaha claims that the protests have been diluted to such an extent that they are little more than exercises in""box ticking"". ""When people constantly want to get me to do blacklivesmatter talks and racial talks and I m like, I m not doing it just so you can put Zaha spoke for us . Like a tick box, basically,"" he said. ""I m not doing any more because unless things change, I m not coming to chat to you just for the sake of it, like all the interviews I ve done. ""All these platforms - you see what s happening, you see people making fake accounts to abuse black people constantly, but you don t change it. ""So don t tell me to come and chat about stuff that s not going to change. Change it."" The debate has been amplified recently by a spate of incidents involving the racial abuse of black footballers. Manchester United pair Anthony Martial and Axel Tuanzebe were targeted by racist fans online last month, while Chelsea s Reece James and numerous other Premier League footballers have also been singled out for abusive messages. Earlier this month, an Irish teenager escaped jail time after sending a series of aggressively racist messages to former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright after he used the player s likeness in a video game. Wright subsequently expressed his anger that the 18-year-old Irishman escaped without punishment. As Zaha alleges, nothing will change within the sport until examples are made of those who use social media to express racist and demeaning motives. ""All that stuff that you lot are doing, all these charades mean nothing,"" he said. ",https://www.rt.com/sport/515486-wilfried-zaha-black-lives-matter/
"12 Feb, 2021","‘Those protests were dreadful’: UK Home Secretary says she ‘wouldn’t kneel’ for BLM, kicking off online slugfest","Britain’s Home Secretary Priti Patel is no fan of the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ movement, and her latest anti-BLM declaration, in which she called the demonstrations “dreadful,” has ignited a storm of controversy online. Speaking to London-based radio station LBC on Friday, Patel told host Nick Ferrari that she wouldn’t“take the knee”for the blacklivesmatter movement, as so many professional athletes, entertainers, and evenpoliticiansare wont to do. “No I would not, I would not have at the time either. There are other ways in which people can express their opinions,”Patel said.“Protesting in the way in which people did last summer was not the right way at all.” Nick Ferrari - Would you take the knee, Priti Patel?#PritiPatel- No, I wouldn t have the time.#LBCpic.twitter.com/yCrovWuRJc Beginning in the US after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, blacklivesmatter protests and riots soon spread across the western world last summer. In the UK, protesters in London clashed with police, desecrated statues, and according to a majority of Brits,increased racial tensions. Patel called the demonstrations, which in London saw a mobpeltbottles and stones at police, as“dreadful.”Though her condemnation was unambiguous, it was not the first time she’s lobbed some harsh words at BLM. She described the movement’s protests as rife with“hooliganism and thuggery”in October, and told rioters in June that“there is no excuse”for vandalizing Britain’s war memorials. “There are other ways in which those discussions can take place and, also, quite frankly I didn t support that attempt to re-write history,”she added, referring to certain councilspurgingthe names of ‘problematic’ historical figures from their street names.“I felt that that was wrong.” Her refusal to entertain the idea of kneeing for BLM earned her praise from the British right. Quite right, Home Secretary! 👍 Whenever anyone trends on this website - Priti Patel today for example - it s because they ve said something manifestly provable, logical and accurate. Completely agree, well said Minister@pritipatelhttps://t.co/srLl5hnSGU However, she also drew scorn from the left, with one commenterdescribingher as“one of the most repulsive individuals ever to hold high office in a British govt.” Sometimes I think when Boris Johnson needs the public to be distracted from his failures he just pushes Priti Patel out the door and says ""Go be yourself!"". The number of times I’ve needed to protect my energy from the ramblings of Priti Patel... wheww! 🙅🏽‍♀️ Weird how people who are told to protest *peacefully* if they want their grievances to be taken seriously by politicians get criticised by Priti Patel for kneeling. Though Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently issued awhispered declarationthat“there’s nothing wrong with being woke,”several of his ministers have pushed back against the liberal orthodoxy that saw BLM celebrated across the west over the last year, often to the chagrin of the liberal press. Equalities Minister Liz Trusscalledon the government late last year to abandon its decade-long focus on“fashionable”issues of race, gender and sexual orientation, and focus on fighting poverty and income inequality instead. Days beforehand, the governmentscrappedmandatory“unconscious bias training”for civil servants, with Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez stating that bias training“may not only activate and reinforce unhelpful stereotypes, [it] may provoke negative reactions and actually make people exacerbate their biases.” ",https://www.rt.com/uk/515424-priti-patel-knee-blm/
"12 Feb, 2021",Charges DISMISSED against two Buffalo cops for ‘assault’ on 75-year-old protester who broke his skull in fall,"Two Buffalo, New York police officers escaped criminal charges for shoving an elderly man during last year’s George Floyd protests. Their indictment for breaking his skull prompted the resignation of the city’s riot police unit. Second-degree assault charges against officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were dismissed, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn announced on Thursday. They remain on suspension and still face an internal disciplinary investigation, however. NEW: Charges against the two Buffalo Police officers who shoved a protester to the ground have been dismissed. He suffered a fractured skull after he was pushedhttps://t.co/dLH6RxxhjK The Buffalo Police Benevolent Association was“extremely pleased”that a grand jury decided to dismiss the charges, adding that McCabe and Torgalski“were simply following departmental procedures and the directives of their superiors to clear Niagara Square despite working under extremely challenging circumstances,”according to a statement quoted byWGRZ-TV. The two officers werechargedin early June 2020, after a video emerged of them confronting the 75-year-old Martin Gugino and pushing him away. Gugino, a social justice activist well known in the community, struck the pavement with his head and suffered a skull fracture, spending several days in hospital. As video of the incident made rounds on social media, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo denounced their behavior as“wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,”demanding that they be fired. There was tremendous public pressure on the police, in the light of blacklivesmatter protests spreading across the US in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Minnesota the week prior. Members of the Buffalo PD’s Emergency Response Team reacted to the charging of their colleagues as well, however. All 57 of them resigned from the unit, while staying on with the department. In an ironic twist, Cuomo’s Covid-19 lockdown prevented the grand jury from convening to investigate the charges for months, and once it was able to meet, Flynn said he had“higher priority cases”to handle. The two officers are""still suspended pending the conclusion of the internal investigation,""according to a city spokesperson. It is unclear whether they will be reinstated or let go.

"10 Feb, 2021",Mark Cuban ban on national anthem during NBA games will deepen US divide. But it’s only the start of a new un-American trend,"Singing ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ at sporting events may seem a bit cheesy, but it helped forge a bond between Americans that is rapidly fraying. So why did the NBA owner ban the tradition at the worst possible time? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Mark Cuban, billionaire software designer-cum owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team, welcomed fans back to American Airlines Center this week for the first game of the season when humans (remember that two-legged species?) were allowed to stand-in for cardboard-cutout spectators ever since the Covid-19 pandemic swept the nation last year. Mavericks fans were undoubtedly excited to experience some semblance of the ‘old normal’ – sitting in the stands, downing some beers, and feeling like the ‘Year 2020’ had all been a bad dream. Of course it would have been swell not to have to wear a mask between hotdog bits and and sips of Budweiser, but beggars can’t be choosers, right? And then something inexplicable happened, or, rather, didn’t happen. The giddy fans were never invited – as they had been hundreds of times before in the past – to rise and join in singing the famous ‘Star Spangled Banner.’ The Mark Cuban national anthem story is not a sports story its part of a much larger campaign against conservative values. The avalanche of negative attacks on GunsReligion National AnthemUS flag Are designed to demonize the brand and conservatives better fight back soon. For those Americans who may have forgotten their history, the anthem was penned on September 14, 1814 by the lawyer and upstart poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing “the bombs bursting in air” during a bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy. It isbelievedthat the anthem was first sung at a sporting event during the Cubs vs. Red Sox 1918 World Series. Admittedly, standing for the anthem was always a rather tedious and slightly comical affair, which forced fans to exert themselves at that divine moment when they were just getting comfortable in their seats. And as a symbol of patriotism, amid an inebriated stadium of rowdy fans, it certainly left a lot to be desired. But the thought of not joining in the patriotic sing-along was simply not something a person would ever think to do – unless, of course, they had a wish to be called a ‘commie bastard’ or something equally sophisticated from the peanut gallery. But just like that, at least for home basketball games in Dallas, Texas, the generations-old tradition had been abruptly scrapped without explanation. Most people, however, already have a good hunch as to the reason why. Cuban’s move comes at a tense period in US history when bread and circuses are no longer the main attraction in town; politics is – or, to be more precise, political correctness and cancel culture are. That much became apparent in 2017 when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee in protest against police abuse during the national anthem. The controversial gesture, which helped to divide Americans and the world of sports like never before, took off again last year with the death of George Floyd during an arrest by a white police officer. That videotaped tragedy catapulted the blacklivesmatter movement to front and center as the media provided a single explanation for the destructive riots and protests that ensued: ‘the rise of White supremacism and institutional racism.’ Marching in lockstep as is its penchant, the mainstream media never bothered to suggest alternative causes – like poor police training to handle the vast challenges they face every day – for the high incidence of Black deaths at the hands of the police. After all, white people also regularly lose their lives during brush-ups with the police. But I digress. Perhaps at a slightly less tumultuous time in American history – like when the former US president isn’t being dragged through a second impeachment following a fiercely contested election, and US cities aren’t struggling to rebuild in the aftermath of “mostly peaceful” BLM and Antifa protests, and monuments to famous historical figures were are not being pulled down in the town square like it’s Baghdad circa 2003 – then perhaps Americans might – and that’s a very big ‘might’ – be willing to have a sensible conversation about shelving the national anthem during sporting events. They were never asked, yet it was they who fought all of the wars to keep Old Glory flying over stadiums. As things stand, millions of Americans now have the feeling, supported by empirical evidence, that everything that was once special and sacred in their country is being torn apart by radicals who have absolutely no attachment to the nation and history, imperfect as it may be. Mark Cuban, despite everything America has done for him, essentially flipped the bird to the US flag, its anthem and his own fans by hitching his star to the cancel-culture wolf pack. What is really illogical about his decision is that, from a purely business point of view, it’s like shooting his franchise in both feet. After all, US companies learned the hard way that the average American sports fan has absolutely no interest in being dragged into the middle of cultural wars during sporting events. That much was obvious when ticket sales plummeted at the same time the world of sports, as well as corporate America, was advocating fiercely on behalf of blacklivesmatter , as well as donating heavily to its dubious cause. Today, there is a noxious cloud of corporate greed that hangs over professional sports that was not so visible in the early days. In fact, it’s even tempting to suggest that Mark Cuban believed the singing of the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ was cutting into expensive television airtime that could be better used to hawk beer and automobiles. That would probably be wishful thinking. The bottom line is probably rarely taken into account when these outrageous moves are pushed on the people. CEOs like Mark Cuban have more money than they know what to do with, and they probably know that people will continue attending their spectacles no matter what happens. Source close to Mark Cuban says decision to not play Anthem before Mavs games isn’t because they don’t love U.S., but because many feel anthem doesn’t represent them, and they want to continue discussion of how to represent people from all communities when honoring U.S. at game. What these cancel-culture radicals really want – and are willing to pay any price to achieve – is for the United States to lose every ounce of its national identity, thereby making it much easier to absorb it into the borderless corporate global matrix. Say what one will about Donald Trump, but his very presidency – anchored on the slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ – was predicated on keeping America independent, something that the people now holding power do not want. Under Joe Biden and the progressive radicals in the Democratic Party, which extends to the world of corporate power and beyond, I fear this disastrous, un-American tendency will become increasingly obvious in the next months and years.

"9 Feb, 2021",Doctors found that police played role in death of ‘French George Floyd’ Adama Traore – media,"The actions of French gendarmes contributed to the death of Adama Traore in police custody, according to a report cited by the media. The case sparked mass protests and riots in the country. The French media cited a report by four Belgian doctors commissioned by the investigators in the case. The doctors said they believed that Traore had“very likely suffered a heatstroke.”However,“the role in the lethal process of a period of suffocation due to physical constraint cannot be ruled out,”they said. They noted that the“momentary containment maneuvers”performed by the gendarmes, and“to a lesser extent underlying conditions,”ultimately led to the young man’s death. An excerpt from the report, cited by BFM TV, said that Traore’s condition would not have undergone a“dramatic evolution”if the officers had not pinned him down. It also said that the doctors believe the man suffered a heatstroke because he was placed in a situation of“brief but intense physical activity under adrenergic stress and atmospheric heat.” According to France Info radio, the experts found that the fact that Traore was handcuffed with his hands behind his back likely contributed to him developing serious breathing problems. In 2016, Traore, a man of Malian descent, went to celebrate his 24th birthday with his brother Bagui in the small town of Beaumont-sur-Oise to the north of Paris. Police drove up to the men while looking for Bagui in connection to a criminal case. Traore did not have ID on him and tried to run, but was caught. Three officers used their weight to pin the young man to the ground. He lost consciousness and died in police custody. An internal police investigation exonerated the officers involved in Traore’s arrest. Traore became a symbol of police brutality in France and was eventually dubbed the ‘French George Floyd’ in 2020 due to the similarities of his case to the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota that year. Floyd was pinned to the ground by an officer and was filmed by a bystander pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd’s death sparked massive protests and riots across American cities and abroad. In France, tens of thousands protested Traore’s death and marched in solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement in the US. The rallies were also coupled with rioting in Paris.

"8 Feb, 2021",Can older and female recruits salvage the image of US police?,"Along with the massive drive to defund US police, one initiative isn’t getting nearly as much attention: recruiting older people to ‘protect and serve.’ Would more mature recruits bring down the number of fatal incidents? Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney It’s legal for a teenager to be given a uniform and a gun, then granted the right to shoot people. The same system bars anyone from becoming president under the age of 35. That’s the paradox of America’s attitude to public responsibility. To counter this, California Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer is calling for a law to prevent anyone under 25 from becoming acop. That poses interesting questions. Would it make for a better police force? Would it eradicate the continued controversial shootings? Is it a bad idea to have armed young people on the streets enforcing law and order? The recent killings by cops of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor led to blacklivesmatter becoming a global phenomenon. It also sparked a sister-movement calling for a restructuring, or outright“defunding,”of the police. But many believe the problem cannot be realistically solved without a deeper cultural shift in the culture of policing – and those who support Jones-Sawyer’s initiative feel that raising the age and encouraging older people to sign up could drive just such a change. Research shows that the parts of the brain dedicated to impulse control and planning don’t fully develop until age 25, but there are more mundane reasons as well. When asking about the positive effects of bringing in older rookies, Seth W. Stoughton, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of South Carolina, said:""Some of it is greater life experience; older officers have more experience communicating with different people so they tend to be better at it, and good communication skills can reduce the need to use force. ""Some of it is aging out of risk-taking behavior; an older officer is less likely to put themselves into an unnecessarily dangerous position.” A study of 186 police shootings revealed that being male, not having a college degree and being younger were more common traits among police involved in such incidents than being female, college educated andolder. Of course, there is also a positive relationship between age and college education. So there is a clear connection that older cops are less likely to get involved in shootings. One supporter of a higher minimum age is Dr. Theron L. Bowman. Now an academic, he is the former chief of police in Arlington, Texas. He said:""Age is less important than life experience and education but both tend to correlate with age. Both tend to result in more interaction with people who are different than oneself thus more opportunities to learn how to better communicate and empathize with them so I do believe a minimum age of 25 should be considered.” These views sound like basic common sense. In Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Montana and Arkansas, you can be a cop at 18. It’s 19 in Florida and 21 in Kentucky, where an innocent Breonna Taylor was killed as two officers fired 32 rounds of ammunition into her apartment. The highest minimum age is 22, in Wyoming. In Taylor’s killing and that of George Floyd – plus the unjust high-profile shooting of Stephon Clark – the officers came from different ethnic backgrounds but were all male. As yet, no force has undertaken a new look at hiring older rookies, but there seems to be no reason not to follow the statistics. Stoughton explained:""We know that police shootings are heavily dependent on predictable factors, such as training and culture as well as an officer’s tactics and decision-making. ""We see variation from state to state and from agency to agency; over a four-year period, for example, officers in New Mexico fatally shoot more than ten times as many people per capita as officers in New York. ""That means that it is possible to reduce police shootings, and the research suggests that having more female officers and older rookie officers could potentially have some effect."" Dr. Bowman’s experience bears out the connection between hiring more female officers and improving policing standards:""When I became the chief of my agency I only had one woman on the senior command staff of about a dozen people. ""When I retired fourteen years later, more than half of my senior commanders and executives were women, during that time my agency developed a national reputation as being one of the absolute best and most professional in the United States.” There is a degree of the hypothetical about all of this. Older rookies will still be involved in shootings and unjust incidents, as will female cops. But the breakdown of trust between sections of American society is almost beyond repair, and something is needed to restore that trust. BLM was even rebranded as Blue Lives Matter, a counter-movement in support of police, with a Facebook page that has over 2 million followers and flags flying at Donald Trumprallies. They describe their mission as“to honor and recognize the actions of law enforcement to strengthen the public support of an understandably naive society.” These two sides ultimately want the same thing: to have police forces that are more worthy of respect. But that will only happen if the actions of officers engender such a goal. Dr. Bowman said:""Policing today attracts people from all walks of life. I believe it attracts people with pure desires and others with sinister motives. That’s why recruitment, hiring, and selection systems must be robust yet fair. ""We must work diligently to assure the ‘right’ people with personal characteristics that make them well-suited for public service are selected into the policing profession. Consistent with Lord Gresham’s Law of Economics, higher standards will attract greater diversity and higher achievers.” There is no overt block on older people signing up currently, but the attraction is not there. It could be that they see the spate of shootings and recoil. It could be how certain parts of society view the police. But if a new older cohort were to join, it could drive a revolution from the inside. Once a new benchmark is created, it would give all new recruits a better concept of the higher standards they could to aspire to. To do this though, police salaries would have to increase in places – contrary to the calls to“defund the police.” Right now, America’s top cop earners are in California making on average $105,220, but at the other end of the spectrum is Mississippi with just $36,290, while the median salary in New Hampshire is$58,820. That large variation across the 50 states means encouraging older people to leave lucrative employment and join the force would be tough. Stoughton said:""If agencies can afford to pay officers well enough to attract highly qualified 30-year-olds, potentially luring them away from other jobs, I think it makes sense to do so. But many police agencies don’t pay terribly well, although the retirement benefits are usually quite good for public employees, so attracting older applicants may be difficult. ""There are really two points here. ""First, hiring officers with more life experience is generally beneficial. ""Second, hiring good candidates is generally beneficial, but many agencies don’t pay enough to attract the caliber of officer that the community might prefer.” Nothing is going to change unless one group makes the first move. But change is needed. If the movement to attract older people to join the cops can begin, then shootings should decrease. Add more women officers and an ability to appeal to better-educated recruits, and the cycle will be self-reinforcing. But if the status quo remains and the shootings and killings keep happening, America s police forces may end up past the point of no return.

"7 Feb, 2021","As more and more black people are jailed in Britain, the so-called ‘fairness’ of the UK legal system is exposed for all to see","New figures have revealed that a disproportionate number of BAME people are being detained in UK prisons. ‘Racist’ policing is often blamed, but a court system weighted heavily against ethnic minorities has become a major problem. David Matthewsis a writer whose work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Mail on Sunday and the Observer, and on the BBC and Channel 4. He is the author of several books, including Voices of the Windrush Generation. Follow him on Twitter@mrdavematthews. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been to jail – as a visitor, that is. Whether interviewing terrorists languishing at ‘her majesty’s pleasure,’ interrogating war criminals in Sierra Leone or hopping on a gurney inside Mississippi State Penitentiary’s lethal injection chamber, I’ve seen enough of the global penal system to know that, despite what the average Sun reader thinks, prison is no ‘holiday camp.’ Even in sleepy Britain, where cynics view ‘doing bird’ as akin to a city break or a spell at boarding school, people forget that the primary purpose of prison is to protect the public from dishonest and dangerous miscreants while denying said culprits of a basic human need: freedom. Basic punishment aside, having spoken to countless staff inside British jails – from seasoned governors to fresh-faced newbie prison officers – all seem in favour of rehabilitative programmes that can help keep the majority of their 84,000 ‘clients’ from becoming recidivists. As over 60 percent of prisoners serving a sentence of less than 12 monthsreoffendwithin a year of release, it’s obvious that Britain’s jails aren’t exactly overpopulated with master criminals. But expecting a short-staffed and under-resourced prison service to turn every petty lag into a JonathanAitkenand rehabilitate them into the promised land isn’t just naive – it’s a case of slamming the cell door after the prisoner has bolted. Prison culture undoubtedly has a radicalising influence on the most impressionable inmates – be that through religious fundamentalism, gang initiation or classic ‘tricks of the trade’ schooling in how to commit a particular form of crime (and invariably get caught). But it’s greed, stupidity, impulsiveness and more often than not poverty that puts a man or woman behind bars in the first place. To say that poverty breeds crime is to elicit a ‘no shit Sherlock’ response from anyone with a modicum of respect for the relationship between social deprivation and criminality. According to LondonMayorSadiq Khan, figures show that “three-quarters of the capital’s boroughs with the highest levels of violent offending are also in the top 10 most deprived, while the same boroughs also have higher proportions of children under 20 living in poverty than the London average.” With the number of British children in poverty set to reach a staggering5.2 millionby 2022, the Tory government’s failure to get to grips with an epidemic of escalating unemployment, school exclusions, family breakdowns, chronic drug and alcohol abuse, myriad social services and a mental health timebomb – all of which make the UK the basket case of Europe – will inevitably lead to an increase in crime. Sure, thanks to the pandemic’s restrictions on movement there has been a dip in crime of late (apart from domestic violence, which is on the rise), but this is merely the calm before the criminal justice storm. And for poor black kids, that storm will invariably become a tsunami. Figures just published by the UK government reveal that51 percentof all young people in custody are from a so-called ‘BAME’ background, despite ethnic minorities making up just 14 percent of Britain’s population. For the overall prison population, BAMEs represent 25 percent of inmates. This latest annual report on youth justice statistics doesn’t just highlight yet another example of the British state’s contempt for black people and ethnic minorities. It also reveals the pernicious way in which elites within the criminal justice system use racial profiling among the poor to jail young black people in ever increasing numbers, while happily letting their minions on the frontline of policing and the prison service take the heat from Guardianistas and radicals for being ‘racist pigs’ for seemingly overzealous stop-and-search policies or being ‘fascist prison guards,’ when they are, in fact, just doing their jobs. This isn’t to say that the stench of bad apples within Britain’s yeomanry isn’t to be rooted out on the mean streets, prison wings and psychiatric wards, where they march to the beat of the ‘top brass’ drum. Feeling the boot heel from on high, a significant minority of grunts with badges or uniforms have always let a little bit of power go to their heads, using black people as a trope for their psychosexual inadequacies. But just as the Windrush scandal laid bare the myth of the ‘motherland’ via the Home Office’s ill-treatment of former colonial – sorry, ‘British’ – subjects from the Caribbean, and the Tories’ laissez faire attitude towards disproportionate Covid infection rates among BAME communities demonstrates its indifference to the health and wellbeing of millions of BAME Britons, it’s the suits in the Crown Prosecution Service, the judiciary, the legal profession at large, and the probation, parole, social and psychiatric services who really hold a young black suspect’s fate in their hands. As the politicaltheoristHannah Arendt might have said today, the wanton jailing of black youths is yet another example of the British establishment’s industrialised and systemic, “fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil.” Since the Tories came to power in 2010, the proportion of young people in custody from a BAME background has nearly doubled (up from 28 percent) and is up from 49 percent in 2019. Black and ethnic youths remain the pariah group du jour. The problem has got to a point that Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy has called the industrial scale incarceration of BAME youth “a national scandal.” In 2017, under David Cameron’s watch, the MP for Tottenham published theLammy Review– “an independent review into the treatment of, and outcomes for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic individuals in the criminal justice system.” Nearly four years on from this damning report, barely any of Lammy’s 35 recommendations have been implemented by the government. Drilling down into the Lammy Review, one finds the true, albeit lesser reported view of the criminal justice system. As the MP points out, “Having looked at the evidence over the past 18 months, my judgment is that we have a significant problem in the criminal justice system itself, and that the treatment of BAME young people shows this problem is getting worse.” For‘criminal justice system,’read‘the legal system.’ The number of black children cautioned or sentenced has doubled since the year ending March 2010, from six percent to 12 percent. Over a third (36 percent) of all remands involved BAME children. This increases to 49 percent for remands to youth detention accommodation, black children accounting for 29 percent of remands. The government’s figures also reveal that the proportion of all cases in which black children were sentenced for indictable offences has risen from 14 percent to 22 percent in the past five years. And the stats go on. Having read the Lammy Review in its entirety, and crunched the government’s latest figures for youth crime, it’s clear that establishment bias – subconscious or otherwise – permeates the criminal justice system, particularly around the fetishisation of young black males. And we’ve heard it all before, from the Metropolitan Police’s invention of the‘Gangs Matrix’in 2012 – a database of suspected gang members operating in London – to Operation Trident and its focus on ‘black-on-black’ crime, to the MSM’s popularisation of the term ‘county lines,’ the latest in a long line of racialised tabloid ‘folk devil’ descriptors that includes ‘Yardies,’ ‘muggers’ ‘steamers’ (remember them?), ‘gangbangers,’ ‘thugs,’ and ‘hood rats.’ This demonisation of black people, and young males in particular, fuels a stereotype that feeds the overwhelming majority of magistrates, judges, prosecutors and defence barrister’s prejudices – subconscious of otherwise – and thus informs courtroom strategy. Yet somehow, we’re meant to believe that the legal profession is beyond subjectivity. Yeah, right. While researching an Old Bailey murder trial a while back for a new book on black masculinity, a left-leaning, white barrister I know who was representing a young black client told me, off the record:“Do I hate the way the system is loaded against black people? Yes, I do. Do I despair at the number of young black men in court? Of course I do. But do I and others profit from it, financially? Undoubtedly. It’s hard to change a system that pays you so well for maintaining the status quo.” Following the death of George Floyd and the tumult of demonstrations that followed, elites all over the diaspora have been falling over themselves to showboat their ‘progressive’ skills, reminding us of how ‘enlightened’ they’ve become on their quest to ‘heal the wounds’ of ‘racial division.’ But while the broadcast media, book publishing, the church politicians, academics and even notionally gazillionaire footballers can’t wait to take the knee these days for a photo op, the criminal justice system is yet to get ‘woke.’ Until it does, the British establishment remains guilty of clearly believing that black lives don’t matter.

"5 Feb, 2021",‘We gotta have them speaking about reparations’: Rapper Ice Cube set to meet with Biden as US president vows ‘racial equity’,"As Joe Biden promises to make racial justice a top priority for his administration, rapper Ice Cube has revealed that he could soon be meeting with the US president to discuss reparations for black Americans. In a radio interview, the iconic musical artist and actor revealed that Biden’s team had reached out to him and that plans are in motion for a White House visit later this month. He said that while he recognizes that the new administration is“really into helping all minorities,”Biden needed to back up his words by enacting""specialty programs."" “You know me, I’m all about reparations. It seems like a bad word to this administration but we gotta change that. We gotta have them speaking about reparations and add some fairness to this system,”the rapper said. Ice Cube revealed a ‘Contract for Black America’ in July in response to growing anger over racial inequality in the country following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police. The rapper described the document as a “blueprint to achieve racial economic justice.” Aside from economic initiatives aimed at providing financial assistance to black Americans, the proposal calls for criminal justice and education reforms. Biden has signaled that his administration is committed to addressing such issues. In a speech on Thursday, he told State Department staff that“racial equity”will be“the business of the whole of government and all of our federal policies and institutions.” Ice Cube has has been pitching his agenda to both Democrats and Republicans in hopes that his controversial ideas, particularly the idea of compensating black Americans as a form of contrition over slavery, will take root. In October, he defended his choice to discuss his ‘contract’ with Trump officials, noting that he had also been contacted by Biden’s team about the proposal and that he’s open to cooperating with“anyone who will work with me.” Trump’s administration pushed through criminal justice reform that received support from rappers Lil Wayne and Kanye West. However, the former administration expressed little interest in reparations. Biden has already begun to reverse many Trump-era policies concerning social justice issues, using a series of executive orders and appointments aimed at promoting racial equality.

"4 Feb, 2021","Canada declares the Proud Boys a terrorist group, as BLM is nominated for the Peace Prize. Now, watch racial tensions explode","Canada’s dramatically dropped the bar on what it defines as terrorism, adding the Proud Boys to a list that includes Al-Qaeda and ISIS, while blacklivesmatter is practically canonized. Is this the way to kill political dissent? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Considering that the foundation of US politics is now constructed almost entirely from the aggregate of half-truths, propaganda, and partisanship, it should come as no surprise that the news headlines are starting to reflect that sorry state of affairs. Case in point is Canada’s outrageousdecisionto designate the Proud Boys group as a terrorist entity, punishing the“white supremacists”for their participation in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Founded in 2016 by the Canadian media personality Gavin McInnes, who has since distanced himself from the group, the Proud Boys now rank alongside the likes of Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Canada’s rogues gallery of global baddies. Ottawa’s designation, which reeks of foreign meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, begs a serious question: has Canada forgotten what terrorism looks like? Ask any person on the street to describe an act of terrorism and their answer will likely include references to deadly attacks on innocent civilians, such as the 2017 suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena in England that left 22 people dead, and the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks that claimed 130 lives. Have Canadians forgotten the series of attacks on September 11, 2001 that struck the financial and military heart of the United States, leaving some 3,000 people dead? Hopefully not, because that cold-blooded act of terror was responsible for getting Canada bogged down in the longest war in its history. As a member of a US-led international coalition against Al-Qaeda in the mountains of Afghanistan for 12 grueling years, Canada eventually lost 158 soldiers and 7 civilians in the course of the fight. For anyone who may have forgotten history, that is what terrorism looks like. It is almost tempting, however, to excuse Canada for jumping the terrorist shark, as it were, considering the hysterical rhetoric emanating from its dangerously divided neighbor south of the border. Ever since January 6, when a horde of disaffected Trump supporters, among them members of the Proud Boys, descended on the Capitol building for the Electoral College count, the Democratic Party and its ever-loyal sidekick, the mainstream media, have been selling that incident as an act of Trump-sponsored ‘terrorism’. Such is the incredible power of the person or party that has the media industrial complex in their back pocket. But I digress. NBC News’ house historian, Michael Beschloss, was just one of many media personalities and politicians who recklessly characterized the events on Capitol Hill as a“terrorist attack”ordered by then-President Donald Trump (who, coincidentally or not, is up for his second impeachment this week). “This was a president of the United States inciting an insurrection, a terrorist attack on Congress,”Beschloss said, without the slightest hint of irony, before dropping the 9/11 bombast.“We observed 9/11, we remember … an effort to fly an airplane into the Capitol and kill a lot of members of Congress. That almost happened. Here is a terrorist attack [on January 6] that did happen.” On both September 11, 2001, and January 6, 2021, terrorist haters of democracy tried to attack our Capitol and Congress. But on January 6, they actually managed to invade the building and put our leaders and our democracy in danger. We had a close call and must never forget. In yet another cheap attempt to politicize the event, House lawmaker Adam Schiff (D-CA) stood on the floor of Congress and conflated January 6 – a day that will certainly live in infamy for the Democrats – with some of the most pressing challenges that have ever confronted the nation. “America has been through a Civil War, world wars, a Great Depression, pandemics, McCarthyism, and now a Trumpist and White nationalist insurrection,”Schiff said with all of the solemnity he could muster. Let’s be clear: to lump together the Proud Boys with some of the biggest names in the terror business is a self-defeating gesture – a case of crying wolf – when it comes to fighting terrorism. Although they will never be confused as boy scouts, aside from a couple arrests for their involvement in street brawls, the Proud Boys have never carried out a premeditated attack on any individuals or individuals, to say nothing of orchestrating suicide bombings, hijackings, or other mass killings, which is the modus operandi of modern terrorism. This is not an apology for the group – just the simple facts. So, why is Canadasingling outthe Proud Boys as a terrorist organization when left-wing groups such as blacklivesmatter and Antifa – organizations that have acquired global reach, as well as financial clout – are responsible for carrying out real violence in the United States? Could the answer be that the liberal government of Justin Trudeau is only too happy to crush a right-wing group of largely Trump supporters, perhaps as a gift to the new US leader, and especially as impeachment proceedings against Trump are about to begin? And with talk of the Biden administration preparing to roll out a ‘domestic terrorism law’, the move by Canada will certainly help in those efforts. In any case, regardless of what happens, radical left-wing groups, no matter how much violence and destruction they spawn, will remain above the law. That much was obvious following the death of George Floyd in May 2020 at the hands of a white police officer, as BLM went on a nationwide tour, looting and burning large swaths of the country. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, for example, three nights of riotingresultedin 400 buildings being damaged, at an estimated cost of $500 million. In Portland, Oregon, BLM and Antifa staged violent protests outside the federal courthouse – government property, just like the Capitol building – where demonstrators clashed with National Guardsmen and other federal agents in scenes every bit as chaotic as those witnessed on January 6. To top off the anarchy, an entire city block of Seattle was taken over by left-wing protesters and declared, ironically enough, the ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone’ – a short-lived experiment in police-free living that was soon disbanded after the citizens of this utopia started getting randomly killed by their own. Meanwhile, through the tear gas and mayhem, the media continued to provide ground cover, as witnessed by CNN’s description of the wanton violence and destruction as“mostly peaceful protests.” Damn. I was watching CNN the other day, and I thought:Involves a Viking hat: That’s a coupInvolves burning small businesses and government buildings to the ground: That’s a mostly peaceful protest How was BLM awarded for their handiwork? With an outpouring of massive corporate sponsorshipamountingto tens of millions of dollars, which could have been better spent rebuilding the destroyed neighborhoods the pack left in its wake. In fact, the outpouring of support for blacklivesmatter , which seems to think that destroying neighborhoods is the way forward, has even included a nomination for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. Incredibly, at the same time Canada awarded a predominantly white, right-wing outfit of US political malcontents with the yellow badge of ‘terrorism,’ a left-wing group of pro-black activists that isn’t shy about resorting to violence to promote its message is in the running for one of the most prestigious and honorable awards in the world. If I’m not mistaken, I’d say that, instead of working to promote a world of peace and stability, some very misguided politicians have just succeeded in driving up racial tensions – and possibly even the threat of terrorism – by several degrees. So, what’s the reason? Are they trying to conceal something – like maybe the great wealth divide,made even greaterduring the Covid pandemic – by focusing attention on the ‘racial divide?’ Or is this yet another symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome, even though the divisive populist has been effectively removed from office? Or, finally, can such inexplicable moves be put down to a case of sheer stupidity? Whatever the case, the inexplicable move by the government of Canada to designate a group of protesters as ‘terrorists’ sends a very bad signal to the world, and does not bode well for the future of democracy and race relations.

And how much do corporatesocialistslike blacklivesmatter ? As ofJune 2020, corporate America had pledged BLM over $1.678 billion, led by Bank of America and cheap-labor lover Nike. BLM was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian lawmaker.

Idiscoveredattempts by BLM (and its enablers) to disguise its history and ideology. But BLM’s scrubbing of its shady past has been to no avail, since its goals and tactics were on full display in the BLM-inspired riots.

On September 16, 2020, Axiosheadlined: “$1 billion-plus riot damage is most expensive in insurance history.” But noted in the report was the obligatory leftist cover for those who looted and set many cities ablaze. “The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims.” In late August 2020, CNN infamously pushed the “mostly peaceful” mantra while a reporter was standing in front of a burning building in Kenosha, Wisconsin. CNN’s font actuallyread, “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.” In May 2020, MSNBC’s correspondentstoodin front of a building on fire in Minneapolis, during a BLM riot.

Or maybe it hasn’t. Perhaps this is the all-encompassing goal of “social justice” – to destroy the fabric of the social body in order to “build back better.” And so, should blacklivesmatter win this coveted award, their honor should henceforth be known as the Nobel ‘Mostly Peaceful’ Prize.

"29 Jan, 2021", blacklivesmatter movement nominated for 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian MP,"The blacklivesmatter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian MP Petter Eide, who claims the impact of BLM’s anti-racism rallies has been felt far beyond the US alone. “I find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,”Eide said. blacklivesmatter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice. In his nomination papers, the MP hailed the movement for its ability to“mobilize people from all groups of society,”including in his native Norway, where some 12,000 people attended an Oslo BLM rally in June. BLM was initially founded in 2013 in response to George Zimmerman being acquitted of the murder of unarmed black US teen Trayvon Martin, who he shot dead in Florida in 2012. The movement gained traction following the killings of other black people, including George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in July last year after officers put him in a chokehold, sparking global BLM-led anti-racism protests.

"28 Jan, 2021","Even in victory, liberals brand all Trump supporters ‘white supremacists’, not caring that this slander is tearing America apart","Recent testimonies from ‘survivors of the Trump regime’ are creating the false narrative that half the US is irredeemably racist, but it is those misguided views, not the MAGA crowd, that pose the real danger to the republic. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Ever since 2016, US conservatives have been subjected not only to the biased news reporting of an activist media, but to the jeremiads of liberals who are forced, as cruel fate would have it, to share breathing space with those knuckle-dragging troglodytes known as ‘Trump supporters.’ Heart-wrenching tales of familial shame and betrayal lurk just below headlines that leave little to the imagination. Gems of journalism such as“‘Wives of the Deplorables’DiscussLife with Husbands Who Support Trump” (“What’s the a-hole-in-chief saying today?”), and“The Very RealPainof Having Trump Supporters as Parents”(“…if my parents supported a racist, misogynistic human as president of the United States, I must have some of that within me too”). Not to be outdone in the scramble to the unfathomable depths of dementia, Time magazine recently published a full-length featuretitled“It Makes Me Sick With Grief: Trump’s Presidency Divided Families. What Happens to Them Now?”(“Soren… is mystified as to why [his Trump-loving parents] couldn’t see the same homophobic and racist behavior and instincts that he saw”). You get the idea. Sifting through this hate-filled collection of ‘Trump-supporters-are-vile-humans’ exposés, I stumbled on a piece ofcommentarywith the promising title,“I’m A First-Generation Indian American Woman. I Married Into A Family Of Trump Supporters.”At last, I fantasized, an upbeat story about that 75-million-strong political demographic known as ‘Trump supporters’ that has never, as far as I know, got a single drop of non-toxic ink by the leftist media. Naturally, I was to be disappointed, and beyond my wildest dreams. In fact, this story far outpaced the pack for propagating the most vicious stereotypes about conservatives I have read since at least last week. In one of the cute anecdotes, the reader is treated to a fly-on-the-wall view of a Christmas scene where a member of her husband’s family received a football jersey with the name ‘Kaepernick’ on the back. “They laughed with derision as they passed the jersey around and heckled the Black football player who had dared to peacefully protest police brutality and racism,”Shrestha Singh wrote. What the writer failed to mention, however, is that Kaepernick, the pro football player turned activist, began the gesture of ‘taking a knee’ during the singing of the National Anthem before football games as a means of protesting police brutality. While most Americans would eagerly support a campaign to end police abuse and racism, many believe disrespecting the American flag was not the best way to get the job done. That Americans from all creeds and colors disagreed with Mr. Kaepernick’s campaign was evident, with football ticket sales taking a major hit as his ill-conceived campaign dragged on. The lesson that the media would not admit is that a person needn’t be a racist to find disfavor with Mr. Kaepernick. But here is where I almost fell out of my chair. After discussing the reaction of the Trump voters to a black player’s football jersey, Singh segued violently into a scene straight out of the film ‘Mississippi Burning’. Here, the author went on to describe a grisly photograph from 1930 that had been presented during one of her creative writing college classes, which showed,“two young Black men, their clothes torn, their bodies bloodied and broken, hung by their necks from a tree. The faces in the crowd are luminescent in the night.”Do you see the connection? Don’t feel bad, neither did I. Although Singh admits several paragraphs later that“tossing a jersey around was not the same as a lynching,”that did not prevent her from making that regrettable connection anyway. Like so many other writers before her, she made a conscious decision to project a heinous crime from the past onto the present in an effort to effectively accuse innocent Trump supporters – even her own erstwhile family – of being cold-blooded racists. That is an attribute the overwhelming majority of people find repulsive and unforgivable – indeed, as it is. Having read this piece, and so many others like it, I understand that my country is being led by the leash to a very dangerous place. And I say“led”because many Americans are now being deceived into believing that theirs is a nation rampant with racists and xenophobes – to the point where, in the current political climate, it is now acceptable to speak about even the possibility of future lynchings. Of course, people are entitled to their views, as set down by the First Amendment, but that is precisely the problem. Only those individuals who tout the anti-Trump mythology that says his supporters are racist white supremacists are awarded a platform – both in traditional media and on social media. All others need not apply. Yet if we are going to outright condemn 75 million-plus Americans as xenophobes it would behoove our media overlords and political leaders to at least allow some open debate on the issue. Yet the establishment has already decided on the matter for us, thank you very much. From Trump’s campaign pledge to close the border with Mexico to the high-profile murder of George Floyd by a white police officer, the media has a ready-made explanation: America and its Trump supporters suffer from“systemic racism.”Period. From that point, it was off to the races, as Antifa and blacklivesmatter (BLM) took to the streets in many uninterrupted weeks of“mostly peaceful protests.” Even when a blocks-long section of Seattle was turned into a cop-free“autonomous zone,”the media gazed on the madness insilent approval, if not outright pride. Compare that kid-glove reporting of BLM to thesavagetreatment the media dished out to those Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building. This politically tainted reporting, where journalists are performing the dirty work of activists, is toblamefor placing many innocent people, not least of all Senator Rand Paul, into extremely dangerous situations. At the same time, ‘inconvenient truths’ about the Trump years are casually ignored or explained away with Orwellian doublespeak. For example, when the media is forced to explain why a huge number of Blacks and Hispanics joined the republicanparty under Donald Trump, the explanation is that these people suffer from – wait for it –“multiracial whiteness.” “What are we to make of … Latino voters inspired by Trump,”asked Cristina Beltrán in the Washington Post.“And what are we to make of unmistakably White mob violence that also includes non-White participants? I call this phenomenon multiracial whiteness – the promise that they, too, can lay claim to the politics of aggression, exclusion, and domination.” Well, there you have it. The phenomenon of minorities throwing their support behind the premier racist Donald Trump, enjoying some of their best economic gains in many decades, is because they, too, want to ride the wave of white supremacy with all of the apparent advantages of membership. Some people must lay awake very late at night dreaming up these ideas. Whatever the case may be, the primary focus of the US establishment should be less about curbing the vastly overblown problem of racism, and more about coming to terms with the media industrial complex’s glaring lack of balance and impartiality when it comes to covering the two predominant political forces in the country. It’s time to accept the fact that, media fake narratives notwithstanding, Trump supporters will be a political force for a long time. Before these millions-strong voters reach the end of their patience with fake news, it d be best to treat them with an equal amount of journalistic integrity.

"26 Jan, 2021","Miraculous anti-racist Covid-19 strain resurfaces in Australia, just in time for indigenous protests","Residents of Sydney can’t have more than five guests around for an Australia Day barbecue, but can gather in thousands to protest the national holiday. Covid-19 is truly a crafty disease. January 26 isn’t a day of celebration for everyone in Australia. Some indigenous Australians call the holiday“invasion day,”and for them the anniversary of the landing of the British First Fleet at Port Jackson in 1788 is a day of mourning and protest. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic didn’t get in the way of planned protests this year. In Sydney, protest organizers split their gathering into 500-person blocs to get around the New South Wales government’s restrictions, while in Melbourne, protesters split into 100-person groups. Just in case you need to get a scale of the protest today in Narrm/Melbourne. Here is the crowd on the march. (In groups of 100 due to COVID restrictions)@GuardianAuspic.twitter.com/3H62mvEy5D The Guardian wanted readers to know thateverything was greatand safe and socially distanced, and that every arrest made had nothing to do with the protesters. Even as video footage inside the Guardian’s article showed throngs of people packing a park and several arrests – including one for assault on a police officer – were described, the demonstrations were still“mostly peaceful and socially distanced.” Thousands of people have packed Victoria Square for a Survival Day March calling for a change to Australia Day celebrations@10NewsFirstAdlpic.twitter.com/3pwoBatRnZ The article was just one of more than a dozen Guardian stories published in the last two days calling the holiday“Invasion Day,”which is hardly surprising given the left-wing slant of the Guardian. Nor is it surprising that the Guardian would downplay the threat of Covid-19 at these gatherings. After all, the mainstream media did the same all across the US and the western world at large last summer when ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ rallies were held in more than60 countriesworldwide. But try to gather a few friends for a barbecue and see what happens, mate. The protesters in Sydney reached an agreement with the police, whereby no arrests would be made if the demonstrators made an effort to remain socially distant. However, anyone hoping to invite five friends around to their house or gather outside in a group of 30 or more will earn themselves a visit from Old Bill and an on-the-spotfineof AU$1,000 ($775), or AU$11,000 ($8,520) in court. Just look at the residents of Melbourne who were smacked with a whoppingAU$20 million($15.4 million) in fines during the state of Victoria’s draconian lockdown last year, or the pregnant womanhandcuffedand frogmarched out of her home for organizing an anti-lockdown rally in the city. Perhaps if they’d just broke the law anti-racistly, they’d have been fine. Likewise, if the ‘Freedom Day’ protestersarrestedin Sydney back in September had only demanded freedom for indigenous Australians, they would have been left alone. If the small group of protestersoutnumbered and collaredby police in a simultaneous protest in Melbourne had carried images of George Floyd instead of placards calling Covid-19 a hoax, they would have got a pat on the back from the Guardian, instead of baton bruises and fines from police. None of this is hypocritical in the slightest, because Covid-19 is an anti-racist disease. It’s true. The coronavirus has the power to transform“super-spreader”events, like Donald Trump’s rallies, intospontaneous outpouringsof disease-proof public celebration, like Joe Biden’s victory parties. It passes over the heads of the righteous and socially just and infects the backwards, the bigoted, and the barbecuers, like a Biblical plague reworked for our secular age. It’s not political, it’s just science. Right-wing motorcycle rallies arescientifically provencoronavirus catastrophes, while months on end of BLM protestsactually slowedthe spread of Covid-19. Don’t roll your eyes like that! You’re not a science denier, are you? But, to opponents of Australia’s lockdowns who were fined or arrested over the last few months, watching thousands of protesters take to the streets unmolested will sure look hypocritical, and political.

"25 Jan, 2021","Pro-LGBTQ anti-war activists, or right-wing extremists? Internet goes ballistic after Jimmy Dore interviews ‘Boogaloo’ member","Jimmy Dore has found himself at the center of an ideological internet feud after the left-wing pundit suggested that progressives share many common causes with the Boogaloo movement, often denounced as a far-right militia. The popular political commentator and comedian interviewed a self-described“Boogaloo Boi,”Magnus Panvidya, after seeing a video of the gun-toting radical denouncing US wars and corporate power during a speech in front of the Michigan State Capitol. Noting that he couldn’t find anything in the speech that he disagreed with, Dore explained that he decided to invite Panvidya onto his show to“explore his beliefs further.” Panvidya described himself as an anarchist who had a long history of environmental activism, rejecting the claim that the Boogaloo Bois were white supremacists or right-wing extremists. He described the movement as a“libertarian/Green Party militia,”arguing that it has been regularly mischaracterized by inaccurate media reports. Known for their Hawaiian shirts, the Boogaloo Bois have been spotted at demonstrations across the United States following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police in May. The group has called for a revolution in the United States, peaceful or otherwise. According to Panvidya, armed Boogaloo members have provided security at numerous blacklivesmatter protests sparked by Floyd’s death, stressing that the movement was similarly opposed to police brutality. He added that, despite claims to the contrary, the group is anti-discrimination and supports LGBTQ+ rights. He insisted that some people who affiliate with the movement do not accurately represent its values, adding that crackdowns on their social media accounts have made it more difficult to coordinate activities and weed out troublemakers. “Being libertarian and being in this weird middle ground… We’re used to all sorts of people claiming a bunch of things about us that aren’t true,”Panvidya told Dore. Later tweeting about the interview, Dore said that he was“completely floored”to learn that Panvidya and his comrades shared many political and social views held by progressives and wanted“unity”with the Left. I interviewed a member of the Boggaloo Boys, I was completely floored when he said he is: -Pro LGBTQ-Pro blacklivesmatter -Anti Police Brutality-Anti Racism-Anti ICE -Anti WarWTF?!?!Radicalized Michigan Anarchist Seeks Unity With The Left.https://t.co/nTXQ3gCEg4 Unsurprisingly, the discussion split social media, with some insisting that the Bois have been unfairly slandered by the media, while others took the polar opposite view and accused Dore of giving favorable news coverage to“white supremacists.” Right-wing commentator Michael Malice gentlychidedDore for expressing surprise about the interview, suggesting that it was no secret that the movement was tolerant and libertarian. Others said they were pleasantly surprised by Panvidya, even while expressing concerns that he may not be an accurate representation of what the movement stands for. Enjoyed the interview.I sensed empathy coming from the dude. That goes a long way with me. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the man mostly reasonable -his speech segment, impressive even. Wiki, however, is saying his sub-group w/in this movement is an exception rather than the rule. But if ppl like him foster communication, I see it as good.https://t.co/75RNNEJzkd However, judging by the responses to Dore’s tweet, the interview was generally not well received.

"21 Jan, 2021","A UK police force is accused of lying about a black man’s death in a case as shocking as George Floyd’s. So, why are BLM silent?","The streets of Britain raged last summer as blacklivesmatter protested the death of George Floyd in America. Why the ambivalence, then, to the police’s alleged conduct in the strange case of Sheku Bayoh in Scotland? Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Outrage and fury were expected to follow the explosive revelations broadcast in Britain on Monday night. This column was deliberately delayed to allow the news to spread and await the inevitable backlash. But it hasn’t come. Allow me to fill you in. The BBC’s flagship investigation show ‘Panorama’ broadcastI Can’t Breathe: Black and Dead in Custodyon primetime TV at 7.35pm to their biggest audience, on BBC One. The documentary looked at two men who lost their lives following encounters with the police: Kevin Clarke in London, in 2018, and Sheku Bayoh in the small Scottish town of Kirkcaldy, in 2015. Their fate had long been known, but not the details. The key case was Bayoh, seen walking around after taking drugs and carrying a knife. Calls were made to police by members of the public, but when they arrived, he no longer had a knife. As officers tried to detain him with batons and CS spray, it was claimed he punched a female officer, then kicked and stamped viciously on her back. Colleagues thought PC Nicole Short was dead, so severe was the beating Bayoh gave her. He was finally wrestled to the ground, fell unconscious and was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later. Big-selling tabloid the Scottish Sunran a storyclaiming he had taken a legal high called flakka, which the newspaper said is believed to give the user “superhuman strength”. Another pieceit ranfeatured the headline:“A petite female police officer was punched, kicked and stamped on by a large man – Force union chiefs speak out”. Her fellow cops backed up this account to investigators. PC Craig Walker said,“I had a clear view of him … he had his arms raised up at right angles to his body and brought his right foot down in a full-force stamp on to her lower back.”And PC Ashley Tomlinson added,“I thought he had killed her. He stomped on her back again.” But according to Monday night’s broadcast, that isn’t what happened. ‘Panorama’ presented an eyewitness who had never spoken publicly about the case before. He had decided to make his voice heard due to the one-sided reporting. Kevin Nelson watched the incident happen over a garden hedge. Asked about the flurry of violence after Bayoh punched the female officer, he replied,“No. He was running off … after the punch, there was no more attack on her at all.” But what about the statements from the other officers about stamping and kicking? Nelson continued,“That never happened. I didn t see him stamping at all or, other than the punch, any raised arms. After the punch, that was it. There was no more attack on her at all. That’s not right.” Bayoh’s post-mortem revealed he had sustained 23 injuries, including a broken rib. But in 2018, the Crown Office in Scotland decided not to prosecute any of the officers involved. The really shocking thing is that investigators had heard from Nelson. He told them what he saw two days after Bayoh’s death, while the cops gave their accounts 32 days later. This revelation is hugely significant. The death of yet another black person in police custody is appalling enough. But now the officers have been accused of making false statements by a member of the public with no motivation other than to see justice done. So, where is the fury? Last summer, hundreds of thousands of people marched across Britain as part of the blacklivesmatter movement. Groups such asForever Familygot dressed up in paramilitary style clothing and held protests. Politicians were taking a knee and the term ‘white privilege’ became familiar to the entire country. Wh the silence now? BlackLivesMatterUK’s official Twitter account posted one message about the show:“BBC Panorama asks why [is] the Metropolitan Police three times more likely to use force on Black people in comparison to white people? Also looks at the death of Kevin Clarke, a man who died in Lewisham in police custody in 2018. This is why we organise.” It got 184 likes, while they have 79,500 followers.

Also looks at the death of Kevin Clarke, a man who died in Lewisham in police custody in 2018.This is why we organisehttps://t.co/XKxtWQLGGF The fact that BLM failed to mention Bayoh suggests either they didn’t watch the show or simply ignored an incident that didn’t happen in London, where much of Britain’s black population lives. Even unintentionally, that indicates they place a greater degree of importance on a black London life. At least with George Floyd, the truth was shown to the world. So, why are details about the death of a married father-of-two in Scotland ignored? Part of the issue is the London-centric nature of the movement. The other is that the British BLM movement seems completely rudderless. What happened in the summer was a reaction to shocking scenes in the US. It almost felt as if some people simply wanted to copy what was happening on the other side of the Atlantic. Black people make up only3.3 percentof the population of England and Wales,1 percentin Scotland, and0.2 percentin Northern Ireland. But the black population in America is far larger, at13.4 percent. Britain’s BLM movement needs to plot its own course and not simply follow a social media hashtag campaign. One of the criticisms it faced last summer was that some believed the anger on display was forced. It’s hard to argue there isn’t some merit in that stance, when the shocking revelations around the circumstances of Bayoh’s death barely seem to trouble anyone. His family’s lawyer, Aamer Anwar, received a measly 12 retweets of his post“#ShekuBayoh died in police custody on the 3rd May 2015, his family fought for justice & now through a public inquiry fight for the truth – watch @BBCPanorama investigation.” #ShekuBayohdied in police custody on the 3rd May 2015, his family fought for justice & now through a public inquiry fight for the truth- watch@BBCPanoramainvestigation ‘#icantbreatheBlack & Dead in Custody’:https://t.co/DafLZxbrEWhttps://t.co/H8EI5DD3Te Those who march under the BLM UK banner and identify as the seekers of racial justice in Britain need to ask themselves what their inconsistent approach says about them, and what their true motivations are. Granted, I’m a white man. But then so is Kevin Nelson, and he seems to be the only one taking a stance over the shocking death of Sheku Bayoh.

"20 Jan, 2021",‘Next superspreader event?’ Americans fret over slipping masks & lack of social distancing at Biden inauguration,"Liberals spent last year bashing Donald Trump’s rallies as “superspreader” events, and potential coronavirus catastrophes. But some commenters spotted danger at Joe Biden’s muted inauguration ceremony. Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony on Wednesday was a low-key affair. With the National Mall closed to crowds, ostensibly given the threat of Covid-19, and the Capitol sealed off from the public behind 25,000 troops and a security fence, only a select few officials, dignitaries, press and guests were present to see Biden take the oath of office. Masks were worn by all, but some keen-eyed observers soon spotted noses poking out, and guests mingling in close proximity to each other. Not much social distancing going on at the inauguration....hugs, kisses, handshakes .....it’s got covid superspreader written all over it !! 🦠 Whilst the inauguration fills me with joy, I am so stressed watching the lack of social distancing. I really hope there’s been a testing regime for the guests on that podium otherwise it’s a superspreader event. 😱 Former President Bill Clinton was among the more prominent nose-exposers. Famed for exposing more than his nose, commenters joked that they weren’t surprised old Bill would let it“hang out a little.” not even surprised bill clinton lets his nose hang out a little on that mask 😆😩#Inaugurationpic.twitter.com/O6SEoOJWlY Does it surprise me that Bill Clinton can t keep his nose in his mask? No. However, some die-hard Biden supporters, seemingly watching a different event, praised the non-existent social distancing on show. Not sure what you are seeing.. but i see no social distancing where all the former Presidents and staffs are. I m guessing they all tested negative before. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have consistently advised Americans to avoid crowds and stay six feet from one another since the pandemic broke out, the media and politicians have been more discriminatory in the gatherings they’ve labeled“super spreader”events. President Trump’s rallies were an obvious culprit, as were gatherings of his supporters – like the Sturgismotorcycle rallyin September. Yet ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ marches and riots, which spread across the entire country after the death of George Floyd in May, were given a pass. Some even claimed that the protests helped slow the spread of Covid-19. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/513142-biden-inauguration-social-distancing/
"17 Jan, 2021",Parents fume as BLM campaigners subvert America’s top high schools in the name of diversity & get ‘racist’ entrance exams scrapped,"It’s not just white students in the firing line, but high performing Asian-American children, too; is it a bold move in the name of racial fairness or just an anti-intellectual assault from the ideology of critical race theory? Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney Few expected George Floyd’s killing to lead to a feud over ‘Asian privilege’. But that is the storm that has been waging at America’s top performing public school, Thomas Jefferson High School in Virginia. The school, often referred to as TJ, offers a college preparatory program emphasizing the sciences, mathematics, and technology to children aged 14 to 18. It is ranked as the No.1high schoolin the nation, and due to its status, earning a place there is competitive. Until recently, it used an admissions test to choose pupils. But that’s now been dropped under pressure from campaigners such as the blacklivesmatter movement, who complain that entrance exams discriminate against African-American children and those from poorer backgrounds. TJ now intends toimprovethe diversity of its intake by looking at“experience factors,”which include economically disadvantaged students, English language learners, special education students, or students currently attending under-represented middle schools. Some have even pushed for admission to be decided through random lotteries. The decision has invoked fury on both sides, with parents and campaignersclashingindemonstrationsoutside the school. The storm erupted when the ethnic makeup of the latest intake – the class of 2024 – was revealed. It showed that of the successful 486 children – from 2,539 applicants – fewer than 10 were black. (The school hasn’t confirmed publicly what the exact number is, but RT has discovered it is actually just six.) The children’s ethnicity was: Asian 355 (73 percent), white 86 (17.7 percent), Hispanic 16 (3.3 percent) and multiracial/other, 29 (six percent). To some this would be a pleasing picture, showing minorities being granted entry to the country’s top school and an absence of white dominance. But for others, including BLM supporters, it’s evidence of the socio-economic advantage of white and Asian children. They say rich white and Asian parents prepare their children to get into TJ by enrolling them in unofficial feeder schools, and pay for special tutoring and materials that prepare them for the entrance exam. The school has a reputation for turning out successful students – its alumni is a Who’s Who of academics, scientists, entrepreneurs, and military officers, as well as musical artists such as Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters. Virginia has beendubbed“the state for crazy rich Asians,”and research shows Asian households there have a median income of $101,515, while for black families it’s $49,562. The state average is $71,535. Glenn Miller, whose child is a junior (grade 11) at TJ’s, feels dropping the entrance exam is a mistake, and will lead to a drop in standards and outcomes. Speaking to RT.com this week, he explained:“The goals of society should be equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. “There is concern that an anti-intellectual strain has infiltrated the ideology of critical race theory and that groups that have historically performed well academically are its targets. “In the larger historical context, we regard what is going on with TJ as emblematic of the struggle between merit and those counterforces whose calls for equity and equality, when left unchecked, can lead to anti-intellectualism.” Miller and other parents have filed a legalchallengeto the school’s decision. He also has concerns that mistakes of the past are being repeated, with reference to how Jews used to be discriminated against:“The statistical evidence we have compiled suggests that a number of the approaches being suggested as alternatives to standardized tests, most particularly random lotteries, benefit Caucasians more than any other group. “But it is certainly not unprecedented for an admissions program to target the academic success of a particular racial group. For example, certain colleges used to cap the number of Jewish students for fear that their numbers would dominate the class. “We believe that it is important for society that its educational systems be able to identify and nurture its very finest students because those students will ultimately be the future great scientists, financiers, and political leaders. A society that chooses its scientists and leaders based on random chance is bound to decline.” Dr. Harry Jackson, whose son is one of the few African-Americans at TJ’s, is similarly against the removal of the entrance exam. He told RT.com:“The removal of a race-blind [exam] discriminates not only against Asians, but against all students that can display an aptitude for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). “The admissions officials at TJ intend to racially norm the school, weighing one race above another, in addition to weighing one’s socioeconomic status over another.” Jackson also has an issue with the school’s non-profit charitablefoundationTJ Partnership, which receives donations from the private sector and individuals:“Under the guise of equity, the effort to remove the test, a submission to the soft-bigotry of low expectations that assumes that Blacks and Hispanics cannot pass the test, is really a target hit on the Asian community to obfuscate the fraud, waste, and abuse of the funds collected by the TJ Partnership Fund.” Thomas Jefferson declined to comment directly to RT, but Lucy Caldwell, the head of news & information at Fairfax County Public Schools, said the old admission process needed improving.“The previous process placed an over reliance on the admissions test,”she said.“The test scores reflect the socioeconomic background of the test-takers far more than the students’ academic potential.” The issue that is dividing TJ is being mirrored across America, as racial and social justice campaigners turn their sights on the nation’s leading schools, and particularly on those where Asian-American children perform well. Three elite public schools in Boston have alsoremovedtheir entrance exams. Again, Asian children areoverrepresented– they make up only 9.1 percent of the school district’s pupils, but much larger percentages at Boston Latin School (29.3 percent), Boston Latin Academy (18.8 percent), and the John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Sciences (20.2 percent). No other ethnic group outperforms its numbers like that, but African-American children are well represented at Boston Latin Academy (21.4 percent) and O’Bryant (32.3 percent) against being 29.3 percent of the district’s student body, while making up only 7.7 percent at Boston Latin School. A major difference compared to Virginia is that Asian American households in Boston aren’t high earners. According toresearchby the Boston Public Health Commission, the breakdown is: Overall median $58,263, Asian $33,185, black $41,465, Latino $30,687, white $86,194. Reports suggest that many Asianparentsof the children at the three elite schools work in nail salons, restaurants, and hotels. One parent, Sum Tan, said the Asian community felt that academic performance was a path to a secure and better life:“Admission by zip code is a form of segregation, not unity. It will push us backward, not forward.” Sharra A. Gaston, a spokesperson for Boston Public Schools, told RT.com:“The impetus of these process changes were due to the pandemic, rising coronavirus rates, and in response to Covid-19 regulations. The pandemic has only exacerbated inequities in our community, particularly for marginalized populations within the City of Boston (including economically disadvantaged, Black, Latinx, English learners).” In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to enroll more black and Hispanic kids in their elite schools, which was also seen as an veiled attack on Asian children, who make up around60 percentof the students at the city’s most prestigious high schools. State assemblyman Ron Kim commented that the“narrative is that it seems to, at best, deny that Asian Americans are people of color too.” The same debate is also happening on the West Coast, as San Francisco’s Lowell High School hascancelled2021 entrance exams. It’s another ‘magnet’ school and regarded as the most sought-after high school in the city, and will now be using a raffle system. Following a similar pattern, 59 percent of their student body is Asian and thechangeswill affect them most. The idea of removing entrance exams is viewed as a left-wing policy and expectations are that it will proliferate under the leadership of Joe Biden’s Democratic administration. How far that goes is yet to be seen, and once Covid-19 is brought under control, there may be pressure to bring back exams. Wenyuan Wu, the executive director of Californians for Equal Rights, feels a failure to reintroduce entrance exams would do serious damage. She told RT.com:“It is a race to the bottom, a politically expedient bandage to masquerade decades of policy failures to improve educational performance in too many underserved communities. “Removing standardized testing in schools such as the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology as well as New York City’s specialized high schools is an obvious assault on the merit-based principle, the bedrock principle of educational excellence in these schools and in America in general. “Phasing out or doing entirely away with empirically proven academic selection will have a disproportionate impact on students of Asian descent as they are balanced out of these schools to help boost artificial levels of optic diversity and proportionality. “In the meantime, no meaningful attempts or reforms are being done to reduce the persistent achievement gap. “A better alternative to promote best practices and encourage our students, regardless of their immutable differences, is to strive for academic excellence.” ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/512647-blm-subvert-high-schools/
"15 Jan, 2021","More power for law enforcement would not have stopped Capitol riot, their inherent bias to the right is the REAL problem","Calls for the police to be given more powers following the Washington disturbances are misplaced.

Follow him on Twitter@BradBlank_ In the wake of the recent Capitol riot in the US, coupled with new information from the FBI that suggests all 50 statecapitalscould soon be under siege, political figures across the country arecallingfor legislation that could greatly expand the powers of law enforcement and stifle freedom of speech and assembly. Much of the proposed legislation in state legislatures is actually refigured versions of similar bills that were meant to silence the nationwide blacklivesmatter s protests that happened in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by police in May last year. As the country begins to perform an autopsy on what actually occurred at the Capitol on January 6, it is becoming more and more apparent that law enforcement had sufficient resources and intelligence to deal with the situation – but they decided not to. Police officers, several of whom were seen livestreaming with rioters, are now under investigation, and it’s apparent there were higher-ups who, for whatever reason, didn’t want to interfere with the mob. The problem is not, as has been suggested, that law enforcement is needlessly shackled by bureaucracy, but exactly the opposite; police have too much discretion in selectively deciding how and when to apply their authority and defend the civil order. This is as evident in this latest example as it is in the day-to-day happenings across the country, where violence is selectively applied to certain individuals and groups but not others. In fact, as the Guardiannoted, police are three times more likely to use force against left-wing protesters according to statistics from USCrisis Monitor. This structural bias against the left is nothing new. Take the story of leading American environmentalist and labor leaderJudi Bari, who was severely injured after an improvised explosive device blew up her car on May 24, 1990. Rather than the case being investigated as an assassination attempt, she was arrested for allegedly transporting a bomb while still in critical condition for her injuries that would later become enduring disabilities for the rest of her life. What made the case especially strange was the fact that FBI bomb investigators – i.e. federal agents – were on the scene at virtually the same time as local first responders. It was later revealed that law enforcement was tipped off by an unknown person in advance. However, what became clear was that Bari was being framed for her own assassination attempt in what the FBI called“eco-terrorism.” Several months later, the Alameda County district attorney refused to press charges against Bari and the other passenger, Darryl Cherney, despite the fact that the media had been saturated with the law enforcement side of events. FBI Special Agent Frank Doyle had claimed in a public affidavit that the bomb was on the back seat floorboard of Bari’s car, while a later forensic investigation found that it was placed directly under the driver’s seat floorboard and had a timer-armed motion trigger. This meant that it was placed by an assailant to kill the driver of the car, Bari, who was clearly the target since it was her vehicle. The conclusion that the FBI had drawn was undeniably false. But the most striking thing that came out of the federal civilsuitthat Bari’s estate and Cherney won was the fact that Bari had notified local law enforcement of death threats sent to her before the day of the bombing – all of which were ignored. Law enforcement was apparently all ears when it came to tips that could damage Bari and discredit the environmental movement, but had their heads in the sand when it came to information that could have prevented an act of terror. This is analogous to how DC law enforcement was a bulwark against peaceful blacklivesmatter protesters in Lafayette Square compared with their pathetic showing at the Capitol. In Bari’s case, would it have made any clear sense to provide Agent Doyle and his FBI colleagues with even more discretionary power? Would it have been a victory for society to simply criminalize the environmental movement altogether in order to stop such incidences from taking place? The answer to both questions is obviously no. The problem is law enforcement itself, its systemic reactionary tendencies and its sympathy for the radical right – even and especially factions that use violence as a means to achieve political objectives. Hell, it’s even being reported that many off-duty officers (and military veterans) were part of theriotson the Capitol. Without first addressing these facts, there will never be any serious application of impartial justice in the US, and any attempt to expand the role of law enforcement without this may as well just be a reversion back to the dark days ofCOINTELPRO. As Glenn Greenwaldput it,“Liberals are having their 9/11 moment (again).” ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/512622-law-enforcement-capitol-riot/
"15 Jan, 2021","US media continues to try to link Trump to Kremlin, but in reality American Republicans have more in common with Putin s opponents","American elites don’t understand that Russian ‘liberals’ are more similar to Republicans than Democrats. What’s more, Joe Biden, and other US centre-leftists, are politically closer to Vladimir Putin than the Moscow opposition. ByPaul Robinson, a professor at the University of Ottawa. He writes about Russian and Soviet history, military history, and military ethics, and is author of theIrrussianalityblog As the American House of Representatives completes impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, efforts continue apace to blame the divisions in American society on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Speaking to the press a day after a mob seized the Capitol building in Washington, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, launched into a bizarre and rather ungrammatical rant, proving in the process that conspiracy theories are far from the unique preserve of the American right. Talking of the previous day’s events she remarked that“the message it sent to the world, a complete tool of Putin, this President is. Putin’s goal was to diminish the role of – the view of democracy in the world. That’s what he has been about. And, again, his enabler in this has been Donald Trump for a long time. That’s why I said in that photo when I’m leaving his meeting, ‘With you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.’” As if taking their cue from Pelosi, commentators have since been working hard to link events in the American capital with Russia and Putin. Lacking firm evidence for this, their claims have become increasingly outlandish. Take for example an article by Natasha Bertrand published on Tuesday in the online magazine Politico. This focused on a Russian by the name of Andrey Illarionov, who served as an economic adviser to Vladimir Putin in the early 2000s. According to the article, Illarionov, long a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute in the US, has left the organisation after publishing a blog post defending the Washington rioters. As Ms. Bertrand writes, Illarionov argued that“the storming of the capitol was a ‘trap’ set by police following deliberate ‘provocation’ by blacklivesmatter activists and Democrats. He also amplified unfounded claims about Antifa infiltrating the protests, claimed it is ‘still unknown’ who won the 2020 presidential election, accused the leadership of the Democratic Party of ‘seeking to establish its monopoly dominance in the country,’ and wrote that rioters were ‘definitely not’ violating the US Constitution when they broke into the building.’” One might wonder why it matters what some long-retired Russian official thinks. But that would be missing the point. He’s Russian!!! He’s linked to Putin! As Bertrand continues,“Some analysts have raised concerns that Illarionov’s comments are legitimized by virtue of his affiliation with the think tank, and again raise the specter of Russian attempts to sow chaos and doubt in the legitimacy of US elections. “Ilya Zaslavskiy, a researcher now leading a project on post-Soviet kleptocracy called Illarionov’s posts ‘downright dangerous,’ noting that they are shared widely within Russia and among Russian-American Trump supporters.” In other words, we are supposed to believe that Illarionov is acting on Putin’s behalf to“sow chaos”in the United States. His blog post is further proof, if any were required, of the Kremlin’s evil designs. Except for one thing: Illarionov is no friend of Vladimir Putin. In 2005, he quit the Russian government, complaining of what he called its authoritarian turn. Since then, he has stood quite clearly in the ranks of the“non-systemic”opposition, and on taking up his position at the Cato Institute in 2009 was described by the state-run Voice of America as“one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critics.” Nothing Illarionov says or writes could therefore be said to represent the position of the Russian government. The idea that his blog post indicates that the Russian state is trying to‘sow chaos’in the United States is beyond laughable. Anybody with even the slightest knowledge of Russian politics would have known this. How, then, does such obvious ‘fake news’ about Russia keep appearing in the American media? There are really only two options – extraordinary ignorance about all things Russian; or a willful lack of concern for the truth. It is hard to say which is better. Beyond that, though, the Politico article does reveal something rather interesting about Russian liberals, a category in which Illarionov would certainly belong. And in the process, it also indicates a lack of understanding of how Russian liberals differ from their American counterparts. The word ‘liberalism’ has many meanings. In its original form, classical liberalism, it was associated with a limited state, individual rights, and a system of law in which everyone was treated equally. In modern America, its meaning has undergone something of a reversal. To be ‘liberal’ now means to favor big government, identity politics, and group rights, and to support what philosopher Charles Taylor has called“the politics of difference.” This modern form of liberalism has found little traction among Russian liberals, whose foundational period was the late 1980s and early 1990s when classical liberalism, in its modern neoliberal form, held sway. Illarionov, for instance, played a role in persuading Putin to adopt a low 13 percent flat-rate income tax, an archetypal neoliberal economic policy. For such classical/neo-liberals, economic freedom and individual rights are key. Big government, group rights, and identity politics are something to be fought. In other words, Russian liberals and American liberals are not natural friends. It’s hardly surprising, therefore, to see Illarionov coming out in favor of Trump and attacking blacklivesmatter . It’s very much in keeping with how Russian liberals think. As an article in Foreign Policy magazine pointed out earlier this year, while the Russian government has expressed some sympathy for the anti-racism movement in the US, Russian liberals haven’t. On the contrary, they have tended to be rather hostile toward it. Liberal journalist Yulia Latynina, for instance, denounced the riots last summer which followed the killing of George Floyd as“pogroms,”and complained that the rioters were destroying private property. Meanwhile, another liberal journalist, Oleg Kashin, tweeted an image with the caption“Martin Looter King,”and one-time presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak was fired as brand ambassador for the German carmaker Audi“after posting a racist tirade on Instagram describing Black Americans as stupid and lazy.” Illarionov, in other words, is not alone. In many ways, Russian liberals have much more in common with the American republicanparty than with the Democratic Party. As the Democrats prepare to take power, instead of lazily shouting ‘Putin, Putin, Putin!’ whenever the word ‘Russia’ pops up, that’s something that they might want to bear in mind.

"15 Jan, 2021",Feds charge ANARCHIST who appeared on CNN after telling Capitol rioters to ‘burn this s**t down’,"The Utah activist who captured the fatal shooting of a woman by Capitol Police during the unrest on video, and told CNN and ABC about it, also instigated the destruction inside, federal charges against him say. According to theaffidavitseeking his arrest, filed in the federal court in Washington, DC, John Earle Sullivan didn’t just film last Wednesday’s storming of the US Capitol – he actually took part in the violence and egged on the destruction that led to the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt. According to the FBI, anarchist John Sullivan told police officers to stand down in the Speaker s Lobby, then agitated the crowd to attack the doors and windows while he filmed. Moments later Ashley Babbitt was shot and killed.https://t.co/4dsh8ivgka Democrats accused President Donald Trump of inciting an“insurrection”after a crowd of presumably his supporters broke into the Capitol during the joint session of Congress that was meeting to certify Joe Biden as the next US president. Babbitt was among the five people – including two Capitol Police officers – whose deaths were linked to the unrest. “Go! Go! Get this s**t!”Sullivan says in the video he turned over to the FBI, as the crowd is breaking through the door inside the Capitol, according to the affidavit. Babbitt is shot shortly thereafter as she attempts to enter through the breach. At other times he yells“Let’s go. This s**t is ours! F**k yeah,”and“Let’s burn this s**t down.” Hey@jaketapperI got a big scoop for you.pic.twitter.com/XlqMN8jNo5 He told a different story to CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Good Morning America the evening and morning after, presenting himself as a left-wing activist who just came to document the protest. “I can t tell you that I agree with Trump or MAGA supporters,""Sullivan told Salt Lake City’s KSTU-TVlast Friday.“I can tell you I don t.”He did insist that his footage showed Trump supporters storming the Capitol, not Antifa as some claimed. Officially, Sullivan is a“civil rights activist”who runs Insurgence USA, an organization established in June 2020 amid the protests over the death of George Floyd. They say they“want to build local powers to enable the community to intervene in violence enacted by the state and government vigilantes,”rhetoric commonly used by blacklivesmatter and affiliated groups. John Sullivan faced charges here in Utah after organizing protests. His most recent video post on Intsa.https://t.co/hD7A90Cc2s Sullivan organized a June protest in Provo where a person was shot, and was arrested over it. A journalist with Provo’s KUTV news looked at the hashtags Sullivan has used on social media and they included both #blm and #antifa, as well as #abolishthepolice. Later in the summer, he delivered an expletive-laden speech at a protest in Washington, DC threatening to “rip Trump out of the White House,” chanting""It’s time for a revolution”and threatening to“burn this s**t down.” BLM inc. threatening to “rip the president out of the White House” They say they won’t wait until the next election.They’re openly calling for a revolution.This is domestic terrorism on full display, out in the open. They don’t even try to hide it.pic.twitter.com/OyhNSzBEwu Sullivan“was at the forefront of pro-Trump violence in the Capitol, egging it on as he filmed,”said Grayzone journalist Max Blumenthal, butquestionedthe activist’s bona fides and accused him of“sabotaging” blacklivesmatter while posing as a civil rights leader. Activist communities around the country have“banished”Sullivan and consider him“a dangerous provocateur,”Blumenthal said onTwitter, citing the DC-based Black House News. Yet he was welcomed on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show, which“falsely”called him a left-wing activist and didn’t ask why he was at the Capitol. The night of the Capitol riot, Sullivan was welcomed on@andersoncooperto present himself as the heroic journalist who recorded Babbit s shooting. Cooper falsely called him a ""left-wing activist"" and didn t ask why he was actually in the Capitol. This was fodder for the Right.pic.twitter.com/LPezi5Hv09 Sullivan“is not BLM or Antifa, and is out to wreck their cause,”Blumenthalwrote. OAN reporter Jack Posobiec noted that Sullivan had posted on Instagram about his contacts with the FBI. That doesn’t necessarily mean much, however, given the rush by many Democrats to report Trump supporters to federal authorities in the aftermath of the January 6 events. Anarchist John Sullivan was boasting on Instagram of his contacts with the FBI yesterday. Today they arrested him for rioting.pic.twitter.com/45YkbBWP7r Whoever Sullivan is actually working for may or may not be revealed at his trial. What stands out is the ease with which he was able to garner mainstream media attention and get people of completely opposite political persuasions to follow his lead at various protests.

"11 Jan, 2021","Welcome to the Big Tech Sweepstakes, where BLM looters win corporate prizes, and Capitol Hill rioters get the boot!","Step up ladies and gentlemen, and take a chance to have your movement promoted by the Silicon Valley overlords, who really aren’t in bed with the Democratic Party, honest. You can trust us, we’ve fact-checked it for you! Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Hello and thank you for participating in the Big Tech Sweepstakes, where your political movement could win the approval of the mighty corporations that now dominate your lives! Isn’t democracy great? Oh look, we have a contestant! Could you please state your name, sir, and tell us a little bit about yourself? BLM: Hi, sure, my name is blacklivesmatter , but my friends call me BLM. I am a social justice movement that first appeared in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin. But my real claim to fame came with the nationwide protests that began in May 2020 with the death of George Floyd, a black man, who was killed during an arrest by a racist white cop. And are you certain the cop was a racist? I mean, isn’t it possible the officer was just poorly trained to responsibly carry out his duties? BLM: Hello? As I said, he was white. And, as critical race theoryteaches, racism is practically a genetic trait of all white people. Their inherent sense of privilege and superiority, cultivated for a long time without resistance, has led to the oppression of minorities throughout history. This makes all white people complicit in the rise of white supremacy, the scourge of our times. Now it’s our duty to let white folks out of their racist closets, so to speak. I see. That’s very moving and inspirational! Is there anything else that has motivated you to speak out on this momentous issue? BLM: Well, as you might imagine, such a movement could never get off the ground without cash, boatloads of it. And with the help of some very generous philanthropy, not least of all from George Soros, I was able to organize a worldwide movement against the systemic racism that is gnawing away at the soul of America. Today, we even have entire sports teams taking the knee during the national anthem, for example, as well as massive corporate sponsorship to protest against racist police. Not a cell phone in sight, just people living in thr moment.pic.twitter.com/Pwm2RZgZXe Well, that is certainly awe-inspiring and very liberal! Okay, just a minute, we have another contestant here. Please, tell us your name and a little bit about yourself. ATV: Hello. My name is Angry Trump Voter (ATV), and, well, I’m furious. Oh dear, that’s too bad. Hey, wait! Aren’t you the guy who just ransacked the Capitol building in Washington, DC during the Electoral College vote count? ATV: Well, I didn’t exactly ransack the place. Please understand that emotions were running high and the police presence wasn’t exactly what it should have been. In any case, I have been ignored and ridiculed by the media for four long years and, to be honest, I am sick and tired of it. So one thing led to another and before I knew it, the police were waving me into the complex. BLM: Excuse me, if I may interrupt for just a moment. Sure, go ahead, BLM. BLM: Angry Trump Voter, what you did in the capital of our great nation was truly disgusting and despicable. You and your deplorable racist rabble defiled the very heart of our democracy. You deserve everything you get for that unforgivable crime! ATV: Well, BLM, aren’t you one to talk about defiling our country! It takes a special kind of hypocrite to burn the American flag, kneel during the American anthem and pull down statues of the American founders. And now you feign horror as Trump supporters dare to take an unscheduled tour of the Capitol Building during working hours? How quickly everyone forgets that just months ago, you were looting and burning a swath across the country, forcing people by threat of physical violence to declare their support of the BLM cause. Most Americans are not racist, you know. Good morning to everyone except Commies who think they’re going to silence free speech in the USA. Not happening. Gentlemen, please! If we can just calm down and discuss this calmly and rationally… BLM: We are fighting for a just cause! The noblest of them all, the equality of all men! But you, Angry Trump Voter, have desecrated the holiest of the holies, the very seat of our representative government! ATV: First, BLM, we are not racists. The media will never tell you that more black people joined the republicanparty under Donald Trump than under any other conservative presidency in recent history. And yes, it is true that I entered the Capitol building, and perhaps that was unwise. But I did not loot or commit arson or declare a ‘self-autonomous zone’ like you did in Seattle alongside your radical Antifa buddies. Unfortunately, some people lost their lives, but far more people died over the course of the BLM riots, with far more physical damage sustained. And let’s not forget that you too, BLM, attacked federal property, particularly the Portland courthouse, where you engaged in violence against federal troops! BLM: Dear misguided Angry Trump Voter, I’ll have you know that BLM engaged in mostly peaceful protests, and even CNN supports that claim. But you looted from the Capitol building and behaved outrageously! Why, you put your feet up on Nancy Pelosi’s desk inside of her private office and even swiped her laptop! Wait a second. You put your feet on the desk of the Speaker of the House? ATV: Well, it was just for a selfie. I couldn’t resist. In any case, aside from the speaker’s podium, and a few other souvenirs, yes, I took Miss Pelosi’s laptop. BLM: That is truly disgusting behavior, Angry Trump Voter. I am mortified and repulsed! Please, enlighten me. What is this strange fascination that you Trump people have with laptops anyways? First it was Hillary Clinton’s laptop, and then it was Hunter Biden’s. Now, you admit to stealing Nancy Pelosi’s laptop! You act like common street thugs! ATV: Well, BLM, did you really expect me to waltz out of the Capitol building with nothing more than widescreen TVs and Nike sneakers like you and Antifa have a habit of doing during your looting sprees? And let’s face it, who knows what unsavory surprises one may find on a laptop. DEVELOPING: Democrats in both the House and Senate are planning to draft legislation to classify MAGA rallies as ""domestic terrorist activity"" and require the FBI, DOJ & DHS to take steps to prevent such ""domestic terrorism."" Sen. Durbin is leading effort along with Rep Schneider Oh, I have heard enough. This is unspeakable. To sneak a peek into a person’s laptop is no better than rifling through their underwear drawer. There are some lines that must not be crossed, sir! ATV: Big Tech, you are employing cheap hyperbole, hypocrisy and theatrics, just like everyone else on the left. For four years, Angry Trump Voter has been subjected to endless media-fueled conspiracy theories – debunked hoaxes like Russiagate and impeachment – and now you want to ignore any discussions about the possibility that the elections of November 3 were rigged in favor of Joe Biden. You want to play judge, jury and executioner based on your personal political beliefs, and then you wonder why a throng of people showed up in Washington, DC demanding attention. Big Tech, you are not an impartial arbitrator! Angry Trump Voter, I am very sorry, but I have heard more than enough of this nonsense. By the power invested in me, I have no other choice but to terminate your physical presence and the presence of your rascally leader, Donald J. Trump, from all social media platforms. You are a menace to society and a threat to yourself. ATV: What!? You can’t just shut down the voices of 75 million Americans! They will never stand for it! I m sorry, it s already been done. Oh, and please don’t hate me. Understand that I am working in your best interest. I am merely protecting you from yourself! Otherwise, at the encouragement of your reckless leader, you may go out and do something outrageous again. ATV: This is an outrage! We have behaved no worse than BLM or Antifa! We will defeat you! We will smash your monopolistic grip on free speech! We have a constitution! Guards, please, remove this angry man from my sight! Such unacceptable behavior! BLM, I apologize that you had to witness such an unsightly scene. You win today’s Sweepstakes and will get millions more in corporate support. And hopefully with Joe Biden as president we can finally look forward to an age of peace and unity in the United States. BLM: God willing! No BLM, Big Tech willing! Test. Anyone there? I think they got me ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/512160-big-tech-sweepstakes-trump-blm/
"8 Jan, 2021",The shooting of Ashli Babbitt by Capitol police has echoes of BLM icon George Floyd’s murder... but she will have no golden coffin,"Both died at the hands of police and both symbolise a cause, but US patriot Ashli Babbitt is branded a “domestic terrorist” after her death, while George Floyd became a martyr to millions and was buried in a gold-plated casket. WhenAshli Babbittpacked her Trump 2020 flag in her backpack and set off from her California home to join a pro-Trump rally on Wednesday, the last thing she would have expected was to end that trip lying on the floor of Washington’s Capitol building dying from a gunshot wound to her chest. In a strange way, her death at the hands of a law enforcement official, has much in common with that of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis who was murdered during a botched arrest attempt by a white policeman last May. Having just ducked out for some cigarettes, Floyd was soon to utter those immortal words “I can’t breathe,” which prefaced his death and led to global protests and the worldwide surge of interest in the blacklivesmatter movement. Like Floyd, Ashli Babbitt was a regular, working-class American simply struggling to keep her pool supplies company afloat. She was a 14-year veteran of four tours of the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, as a security forces controller. After leaving the military in 2016 she had her ups and downs, just like George. But like him, her sudden death was unexpected. And like him, it came at the hands of policemen and has caused tremendous uproar. Only one, however, will go to their grave condemned by President-elect Joe Biden as a “domestic terrorist.” And that is not George Floyd. For the past four years, President Trump has unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy.Yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack.pic.twitter.com/Mcli7mzENu Although he had a five-year prison stretch behind him, was a habitual drug user and at the time of his arrest was thought to be attempting to pass counterfeit money, now none of that matters. He was buried in a‘Promethean’ gold-plated casket– like Michael Jackson and James Brown – estimated to have cost $30,000 during a funeral at which boxing champion Floyd Mayweather picked up the tab. The coffin, the service, the celebrity paying the bill; all these were not because George Floyd was necessarily a valued member of the community whose contributions to society would be sorely missed. It was because of what his death represented. George is a modern-day martyr to a cause. Just as many will inevitably claim Ashli Babbitt is to hers. This simple 35-year-old Californian described herself on Twitter as a Libertarian who loved her “dude,” dog and country. That image doesn’t quite chime with that of Biden’s insensitive rebuke of the protesters as “domestic terrorists.” It is unlikely that anyone will be calling for a gold-plated casket in which to bury Ashli Babbitt, but you would expect that as veteran with a long career of honourable military service, she might be laid to rest with the Stars and Stripes draped over her coffin. That could put theUS Department of Veterans Affairsin an awkward position. If the family requests as much, the flag should be provided as it relates only to Babbitt’s service record while in the USAF, not what she did once discharged. While she might have flirted with the flat-earthers of QAnon and retweeted bonkers conspiracy theories as sheexplored politicsfree of the oversight of military service, these are not crimes under current US law and don’t point to her being some mad racist, Nazi, satanist or terrorist. Those who insisted on highlighting the flawed character of George Floyd were widely condemned, and now those efforts to paint Ashli Babbitt as something she wasn’t should also be resisted. While neither of these symbols of a deeply divided country could be called saints, George Floyd will always be remembered as the unwitting instigator of a movement that changed the way we think about race. Ashli Babbitt’s legacy is yet to be determined but she does not deserve condemnation for choosing to be a patriot. Joe Biden should take note.

"7 Jan, 2021","Getting warmer: While insisting Antifa has nothing to do with the Capitol riot, NYT finally admits it is a ‘movement’","After months of fervent denials and rioting, Antifa is no longer being written off as a mere ideology by a US establishment outlet, which graduated them to “a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists.” “There is no evidence that Antifa activists stormed the Capitol,” the New York Times affirmed on Wednesday, blaming “the far right” for making “untrue claims that antifascist activists infiltrated protests.” There is no evidence that the antifa movement — a loosely organized collective of antifascist activists — stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.https://t.co/YD3PlqDlGIpic.twitter.com/Gru5XbBtP5 While some on the ground would beg to differ, the fact that the New York Times is even referring to Antifa as a semi-organized group is a divergence from its previous coverage, which described it as “a movement or ideology” rather than a real organization. The outlet even argued it was “impossible” to know how many members of Antifa existed due to its cell-like organizational structure. The NYT was attempting to “debunk” a longstanding claim that Antifa followers were dressing up as Trump supporters and committing wanton acts of violence in order to make conservatives look bad — in this case at the Capitol riots on Wednesday, which turned bloody and left four people dead including a woman shot by police. However, conservative provocateur (and sometime Antifa victim) Andy Ngo actually agreed with the outlet for once, arguing the protesters filmed swarming the Capitol did not look to be “antifa people dressed in Trump gear or Trump costumes.” The ‘paper of record’ has regularly come down on the side of Antifa in the past, noting that “supporters” (if not members) viewed the street violence that has become a hallmark of the group as merely in service to a greater good. Right-wing ideas, the group supposedly believes, must not be presented to the general public, lest an unaffiliated individual fall in line with the “targeting of marginalized people.” The paper admitted doxxing and violent confrontation were part and parcel of the Antifa ‘ideology,’ while arguing in favor of such ‘preemptive strikes’ against the so-called alt-right. Even FBI director Christopher Wray paid lip service to the notion that Antifa was not an organized group in September, attempting to please both President Donald Trump and his detractors by agreeing that while there was no such thing as an Antifa member, the group’s supposed ideology was a “real thing” and that “violent anarchists” might “self-identify” with Antifa. As recently as September, the NYT was still claiming Antifa was “not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles.” Instead, it was “a loose movement of activists whose followers share some philosophies and tactics.” Any claims of Antifa members fighting alongside blacklivesmatter were declared delusional conspiracy theories fueled by an ‘irresponsible’ president. Trump has long sought to have Antifa labeled as a terrorist organization, particularly as violence raged in cities across the nation in the wake of the death of black Minneapolis man George Floyd at the hands of the police. Former attorney general William Barr claimed back in June that his Justice Department had evidence Antifa and its ideological allies had been “involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity” that followed Floyd’s death. However, even Barr insisted Antifa was “a very loosely organized group,” even while acknowledging there was “clearly some high degree of organization” within and what appeared to be serious funding.

The protesters hoisted a Somali flag over a building at one point. Hundreds of protesters marched in the city on Sunday, in a demonstration organized by ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ activists and Muslim organizations. They were protesting over the killing of Dolal Idd, 23, the son of a Somali immigrant. As Muslim community leadersaddressedthe crowd in Somali, some protesters raised a Somalian flag over a gas station, allegedly after taking down an American flag. #MinneapolisThey’re still going to protest against the officer-involved shooting in Minneapolis; despite it being clear on bodycam that the man attempted to ram officers with a vehicle; and then fired a handgun at police, prior to officers returning fire.pic.twitter.com/jh4KHKEE3O The gesture incensed conservatives.“What complete utter disrespect,”one commenter wrote.“Imagine raising an American flag in Somalia... you’d be tortured and killed.

"2 Jan, 2021","No longer ‘JUST AN IDEA’? With Trump on way out and Biden on way in, Portland mayor finally vows to ‘push back’ against Antifa","After seven months of almost nonstop riots, when even the firebombing of his own condo building couldn t spur him to act, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has suddenly vowed to “push back” against the Antifa violence plaguing his city. “My good-faith efforts at de-escalation have been met with ongoing violence and even scorn from radical Antifa and anarchists,”Wheeler said Friday, in a New Year s Day address.“In response, it will be necessary to use additional tools and to push the limits of the tools we already have to bring the criminal destruction and violence to an end.” Wheeler went so far as to condemn""anyone who engages in violence or criminal destruction""and called on federal law enforcement agencies to partner with local and state police to develop plans for fighting anarchist violence. The statement comes after months of the mayor blaming President Donald Trump for inciting violent protests. The timing of Wheeler s turnabout – with Democrat President-elect Joe Biden scheduled to take office on January 20 -- wasn t lost on social media users. One commenter translated the mayor s message as follows:""Antifa has outlasted their usefulness. I cannot let them continue to be a nuisance to the Biden administration."" ""Antifa has outlasted their usefulness, I can not let them continue be a nuisance to the Biden administration."" Other observers mocked Wheeler and other Democrats for previously downplaying Antifa s negative impact. Biden even called the group""an idea, not an organization""in his September 29 presidential debate with Trump. ""But Joe Biden told us Antifa was just an idea,""Trump supporter Matt Hudgens said.""Also, you re a year late. You wanted the riots for political gain. Don t act like suddenly you condemn them now.""School-safety activist Kyle Kashuv echoed those sentiments, saying,""But I was reliably told by officials (Ted Wheeler) that Antifa was just an idea."" But@JoeBidentold us ""Antifa"" was just an idea...Also.. Your a year late@tedwheeler.. You wanted the riots for political gain.. Don t act like suddenly you condemn them now..pic.twitter.com/tvrcD4fAC3 But I was reliably told by officials (ted wheeler) that antifa was just an idea?https://t.co/KLvYFTnryx The Portland Antifa and blacklivesmatter riots, which began in late May after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, have resulted in millions of dollars in property damage and led to violent assaults, murder and the temporary takeover of a section of the city, which was declared a separate country. Wheeler announced in early September that he was moving out of his upscale Pearl District condominium after rioters tried to torch the building. Even then, Wheeler lamented the incident from the perspective that it distracted from""theimportant messageof the racial justice movement""– not as a sign that those responsible for the violence need to be apprehended and punished. Portland s latest major flare-up of violence occurred on New Year s Eve, when rioters vandalized properties, set fires and allegedly threw firebombs at police. Wheeler said Friday that Portland needs to upgrade its surveillance capabilities to gather intelligence on""small groups of organized criminals.""He also called for harsher sentences against those convicted of damaging property and suggested that the perpetrators be required to meet with the victims of their crimes and perform community service work, such as picking up litter and removing graffiti. He told business owners and others who have been victimized that,""I want you to know you have my full sympathy."" ""It’s time to push back harder against those who are set on destroying our community and to take more risks in fighting lawlessness,""Wheeler added. Twitter users ridiculed Wheeler for arriving at that conclusion so late in the game.""He s trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube,""former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. He’s trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube.https://t.co/fFhJcr5gsX Podcast host Felix Fernandes agreed, saying Wheeler is""about six months late with his tough talk.

"1 Jan, 2021","Amid crises and pandemic, Pelosi chooses to focus on new Congress rules that ELIMINATE ‘gendered terms’","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has revealed that she intends to continue her party’s embrace of symbolic wokeness into the new year, with a rules package that eliminates “gendered terms” like “mother” and “father” from the House. Despite underperforming at the polls in November, Pelosi’s Democratic Party managed to hold onto their slim majority in the House of Representatives, and Pelosi to her leadership of the House. The California Democrat unveiled arules packagefor the 117th Congress on Friday that, among other ethics and accountability measures, bakes virtue-signaling wokeness into official procedure. The proposed rules“honor all gender identities by changing pronouns and familial relationships in the House rules to be gender neutral.”This means that members of Congress will no longer speak about“mothers”and“sons,”but of“parents”and“children.” “step-brother”and“step-sister”will become“step-sibling.” “Himself or herself”will be replaced with“themselves.” Nancy Pelosi is really focusing on the issues that matter to the American people by striking gendered language like ""mother, father, daughter, and son"" from the House rules for the 117th Congresspic.twitter.com/ZE2iAg63Az In an officialpress release, the House Rules Committee said that the changes ensure that“we are inclusive of all Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioners and their families – including those who are nonbinary.” Furthermore, the new rules will require all standing committees to report on how their work addresses“issues of inequities on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, or national origin.”They also call for the establishment of a permanent“Office of Diversity and Inclusion.” That Pelosi’s party would engage in such performative identity politics is no surprise. Earlier this year, the speaker led a gathering of House and Senate Democrats in taking a symbolic knee to honor George Floyd, with the group all clad in traditional African garb. After the photo opportunity, Pelosi repeatedly told the House that“ blacklivesmatter ”during a speech urging members to pass a police reform bill. Likewise, Pelosi hasn’t missed an opportunity to take the exact opposite stance to President Donald Trump since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. A month after Trump banned incoming flights from China, Pelosiurgedtourists to visit San Francisco’s Chinatown, telling them it was“very safe to be in Chinatown.”Amid changing CDC guidance on mask wearing, Pelosi wore a mask during every public appearance once it emerged that Trump was less keen on donning his. The 117th Congress will vote on the new rules package once it convenes in January. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/511341-pelosi-house-gender-neutral/

"31 Dec, 2020",Top 10 ANTI-WOKE media heroes of 2020,"In RT’s The Wokies series, we’ve honored the professional MSM moaners who spent much of 2020 lecturing their audience on the finer points of woke doctrine. Now we recognize the journalists and pundits who refused to bow down. Race riots, a presidential election, and a global pandemic gave the media plenty to report about in 2020, but also plenty to virtue-signal about and pontificate on. Andpontificate they did. After a year in which woke wackiness went mainstream and social justice replaced actual justice, RT’s The Wokies honors the few who pushed back, or simply held onto their common sense. “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act,” reads a famous quote sometimes attributed to George Orwell. Suzanne Moore probably didn’t think of herself as a revolutionary when shewrotein March, “Sex is not a feeling. Female is a biological classification that applies to all living species. If you produce large immobile gametes, you are female.” But to trans activists, she may as well have tossed a Molotov cocktail. Moore’s piece appeared in the Guardian – usually a soapbox for the wokest of the woke – and was met with a public letter of attack signed by the Green Party’s co-leader Siân Berry, Members of Parliament Zarah Sultana and Nadia Whittome, UK Black Pride founder Lady Phyll, and Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK. Others were less restrained, with some issuing death and rape threats to Moore and her children. Even 338 so-called journalists at the Guardian complained to their editor about Ms. Moore’s nasty words, and Moore parted ways with the liberal paper. Well done, journalists. The notion that journalists should hold the powerful accountable and speak out against tyranny and corruption on both sides of the political aisle is one lost on many reporters, whether they’re parroting spy agencypropagandato get one over on Donald Trump, or ignoring the misdeeds of Democrats to aid his removal from office. Glenn Greenwald, however, has not gone down this route. As journalists of all stripes jumped aboard the ‘Orange Man Bad’ bandwagon, Greenwald stayed principled, calling out the ‘Russiagate’ investigation as bogus, the modern left for cosying up to the censorious tech titans, and even his former news outlet,The Intercept, for laundering news in favor of Joe Biden. Needless to say, Greenwald’s liberal counterparts aren’t happy, and spent much of 2020 accusing him of cosying up to Trump, and by extension Russia – flogging exactly the same dead horse for which Greenwald regularly ridicules them. The legacy media’s continued beclowning of itself offers little to viewers and readers looking for original thought and analysis. Against this, a new ecosystem of bloggers, podcasters, and Twitter s**tposters has sprung up to fill the void. Leftists tired of identity politics and lectures on the inherentracism of gardeningare tuning in to ‘Red Scare,’ an American podcast presented by Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova – two commentators unafraid to shred the pieties of their own side. Right-wingers looking for something beyond the network of college-Republican grifters are seeking out Bronze Age Pervert’s thunderingsermonsagainst modernity and liberalism, peppered with 4chan lingo and philosophical musings. Meanwhile, cynics of all persuasions are reading Niccolo Soldo’s Substackblog, in which the Croatian contrarian brutally scrutinizes US foreign policy and rails against the neoliberal consensus. Or you could just re-read the1619 Projectagain, if Pulitzer-winning propaganda is more your thing. We talked to Mark Crispin Miller, the NYU professor suing his colleagues for libel over a classroom masking controversy, about covid heresy, academic freedom, conspiracy theories, Edward Bernays, and the changing face of propaganda in the internet agehttps://t.co/A8UlR2oKPB Anyone can use their social media platform to rant, rave, and condemn the mainstream wokescolds and their agenda, but few have had the impact of Christopher Rufo. A researcher and writer, Rufo began exposing the content of ‘Critical Race Theory’ seminars on Twitter this summer, revealing in detail how federal agencies and megacorporations pay ‘diversity consultants’ to lecture their white employees on their inherent white supremacy, their “unconscious biases,” and their need to renounce their “white privilege” while simultaneously “owning their racism.” Rufo’s research led President Donald Trump to ban these ideological struggle sessions from government departments by executive order, and threaten to pull funding from schools teaching Critical Race Theory. On taking office, Biden has vowed to reverse Trump’s ban. Rufo, meanwhile, has promised to filelawsuits, telling the practitioners of Critical Race Theory to “buckle up.” Earlier this summer, a group of 150 academics, journalists and public figures put their names to aletterpublished in Harper’s Magazine, in which they publicly condemned the creeping “ideological conformity” of the left. The letter triggered a storm of controversy, with the most hysterical woke activists complaining they felt “less safe” around its signatories afterwards, and a group of these social justice-minded figures coming together to declare the Harper’s gang “racist” in theirown missive. However, the letter wasn’t exactly the hammer blow against the woke left its signatories would have you believe. It opened with some perfunctory lines condemning Donald Trump and praising the blacklivesmatter movement, was signed by figures like JK Rowling who’ve attempted to “cancel” their opponents before, andexcludedsome potential names deemed too controversial. A little victory at most, but in this woke world, we get the heroes we deserve. Name one TV host so controversial that a mere appearance on his show is grounds for a good old-fashioned canceling. Yep, it’s Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. Carlson spent 2020 excoriating BLM, the woke “mob” and their supporters in politics, big tech and the journalists cheerleading its censorship efforts, and the “DC elites” who pushed the “defective”Joe Bidenacross the finish line and into the presidency. Carlson has also bucked the corporate-friendly conservatism of his Fox News colleagues, praising Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren’s economic plan, and hosting left-wing guests such as Glenn Greenwald and socialist professor Cornel West. Liberals have called Carlson’s prime-time show “the white power hour,” but the average American clearly disagrees with the hysterics: ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ broke all records this July to become the highest-rated program in cable news history. Andrew Doyle is a comedian and self-described “anti-woke” columnist with Spiked – a description that by itself doesn’t raise many eyebrows. However, Doyle’s single greatest contribution to the anti-woke cause has been the creation of Titania McGrath, a parody Twitter account that satirizes the modern left’s worst excesses with such skill that it’s often impossible to tell Titania’s posts from those of the most committed social justice warriors. Indeed, McGrath’s satirical comments are so perfectly on the nose that they’ve tricked conservatives and, in some cases, foreshadowed actual articles in mainstream outlets. When Doyle, via McGrath, called Helen Keller out last year on her “staggering” levels of white privilege, he likely had no idea that Time Magazine would agree a year later,writing this monththat, to some black activists, Keller, despite disabilities, was “just another privileged white person.” Like the Harper’s signatories, Matt Yglesias would not be included here had wokeness not completely jumped the shark in 2020. A progressive, and the co-founder of Vox, Matt parted ways with the liberal news site in November, joining Greenwald and some of the new alternative pundits blogging on Substack instead. Though a liberal, Yglesiaswrotethat he divorced himself from the “college grad bubble” of the modern left media – which pushes non-starter ideas such as defunding the police and making the word “Latinx” a thing – to focus on genuine, non-woke issues. Predictably, Substack itself was soon declared racist by mainstream pundits. Another left-leaning journalist to pack it in and head for Substack this year was Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi. Making the move in April, Taibbi criticized the “left leaning” news outlets in the US for leaning “not really ‘left’ but ‘aligned with the Democratic Party.’” Since then, Taibbi has continued to expose wrongdoing on both sides of the political divide, as well as negligence and sycophancy by the press, in particular, the liberal media peddlingintelligence-agency hokumin the name of ‘Russiagate’. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone is publishingarticleson the ethical minefield that is living with Trump supporters. When BLM rioters took to the streets after the killing of George Floyd in May, the mainstream media was determined to present the lawlessness in as positive a light as possible. Some unintentionallyhilariousmoments ensued, such as CNN’sdescriptionof a burningMinneapolisas “fiery, but mostly peaceful,” and MSNBC’s explanation of the unrest as “not, generally speaking, unruly.” The rioting soon spread, and when Antifa groups joined in, the media remained keen to downplay the violence consuming cities such as Portland and Seattle. On the ground, however, streamers like Elijah Schaffer, Maria Viti, Kalen D’Almeida and RT’s own Sophia Narwitz captured raw footage that rendered mainstream reporting irrelevant, biased, and false.

"31 Dec, 2020",Protesters confront Minneapolis police after city sees first cop-involved killing since George Floyd,"A large crowd has gathered in Minneapolis near the scene of a traffic stop that ended in a deadly shootout, marking the first police-involved killing since the death of George Floyd. Police shot and killed a man in an exchange of gunfire, after pulling his vehicle over on Wednesday night, the city’s police force said. The individual was pronounced dead by medical personnel who came to his aid. A female passenger in the car was not injured, and no officers involved in the incident were wounded, a spokesperson for the Minneapolis police department said. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said during a press conference that officers were making a traffic stop involving a man who was suspected of being involved in a felony case when the individual opened fire on police. The officers then returned fire, killing the man, Arradondo claimed. He promised to release body camera video documenting the alleged shootout on Thursday. The incident rekindled anti-police sentiment in the city, with several hundred people assembling at the scene about an hour after the shooting. Part of the large crowd is surrounding a Minneapolis PD squad off Cedar with chants of ""Fu*k 12"" and ""ACAB"".Highly organized with like what we saw during the summer.. Many came prepared in gas masks and the usual BLM ""marshalls"" are watching the crowd, some in yellow vests.pic.twitter.com/mIP74LfVyl The crowd shouted obscenities at police as they blocked the street. One video purportedly taken at the site shows a group of angry residents chasing away a police cruiser. Police in riot gear were later dispatched to the area. According to reports, officerscomplainedthat protesters were throwing “ice balls” at them. Minneapolis Police are now in riot gear on 36th and Cedar.

His death sparked riots in the city that quickly spread across the United States and even abroad, and led to nationwide efforts to“defund”police departments accused of racist, violent behavior.

"30 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top 10 ART WORLD dumpster fires of 2020,"Instead of contributing some semblance of balance and sanity to the weird woke world we have inherited, artists have jumped on the social justice bandwagon with reckless abandon, lending credence to many crazy ideas. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Here they are, the outrageous masterpieces of woke culture that contaminated the art world in 2020. One public monument that won’t be torn down anytime soon by the woke mob is the sculpture ‘Medusa With the Head of Perseus,’ which depicts the snake-haired Gorgon clutching the severed head of the Greek god. Created by artist Luciano Garbati on behalf of the #MeToo movement, the Medusa faces the Manhattan Supreme Court, where Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was sent to prison for sexually assaulting a bevy of actresses and other female staff. What began as a laudable idea – calling out sexual predators lurking inside of the film industry – the #MeToo movement snowballed into a media-hyped inquisition where dozens of famous men had their lives and careers ruined over nothing more than the rumor of sexual impropriety. Although some of the accused certainly deserved public condemnation, and worse,othersarguably did not.  One consequence of the so-called ‘Weinstein Effect’ is that men are becoming more guarded inside of their male-dominated industries, and“more reluctant”about hiring a female, Forbesreported. At the same time, it has raised the glass ceiling for women by several feet. Regrettably, Garbati’s poorly conceived Medusa would better serve as a tombstone for the ill-fated #MeToo movement as opposed to the clarion call it was intended to be. To continue with the delightful decapitation theme, a painting was unveiled this year on Instagram that gave new meaning to the term ‘controversial.’ More shocking than the picture itself, which featured two obese black women holding the severed heads of a white man and woman, was the fact that the popular social media platformfailedto censor it. In fact, it defended the savage imagery by saying“[B]ecause Instagram is a global community, we understand that people may express themselves differently.”Well, that’s certainly a change of tune. By way of thought experiment, imagine what Instagram’s reaction would have been had two obese white women been featured holding … well, you get the idea. Starting in 2017, when the so-called comedian Kathy Griffin posed with a mock-severed head of Donald Trump (which she tweetedagainin November of this year without consequence), and despite Big Tech’s hand wringing over any and all forms of ‘hate speech,’ aggressive forms of ‘artistic expression’ targeting white people seem to be increasingly acceptable. That is a disturbing trend in the art world that should give pale-faced members of the Caucasian tribe some pause. During this summer’s showdown between riot police and blacklivesmatter protesters in Portland, Oregon, the action came to an abrupt halt when ‘Jen,’ an unabashed sex worker, strutted her stuff towards the police line armed with nothing but a knit cap, face mask and her feminine charms. A comical confusion erupted amid the storm troopers, who beat a hasty retreat before the advancing genitalia, and, lo and behold, a star was born. The media was“practically drooling over the literal blank slate they’d been presented with,”observed RT commentator Helen Buyniski on these pages. Strangely, however, theheroineseems to have fallen out of favor with the media overlords. Could her apparent lack of melanin have anything to do with it? At a time when the media-generated script really called for an Aretha, what it got instead was an Athena. That unforgivable oversight screamed between the lines in an opinion piece by Mitchel S. Jackson in the New York Times (‘Who gets to be a ‘Naked Athena’?), where hequestionedthe“weird”motives of the naked (white) protester, as well as that of his predominantly white city.“Portland itself is 77.1 percent white and 5.8 percent Black. That’s why the blacklivesmatter protests there look like they do — white. They have to; that’s who lives there.”By the way, that was no compliment. Jackson wraps up his piece by lamenting that in Portland“whiteness hovers over us Black folk.”In other words, don’t expect the now-famous photo of ‘Naked Athena’ staring down Portland’s finest on behalf of BLM to be nominated for a Pulitzer anytime soon. It just does not jive with the times. Just because Britain freed itself from the European Union doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll be seeing the return to good old fashioned British culture and tradition anytime soon, especially on the art scene. That much seems certain by a new tax-funded exhibition, ‘Thirteen Ways of Looking,’ that opened to the public this year. Judging by some of the titles on display, including ‘NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism,’ it is easier to understand a review by fellow RT columnist, Alexander Adams, who speculated that some may get the impression the event was a“work by some comedian gently taking the mickey out of today’s increasingly woke art world.” Alas, however, at a time when humor is the best antidote to these woke times comedy is now viewed as thought crime. Thus, hardcore reality will have to serve as comic relief, which should work just fine considering the sort of art on display. For example, what comedian could outperform a discussion on“Black women as neuroscientists using the domain of the beauty salon as a rebel underground network for a radically new shared system of communication”? Whatever the case may be, British art enthusiasts may soon be required to travel to the Middle East or Central Asia to attend an art exhibition on quintessential British themes, as opposed to those artificially derived from distant shores. Once again, another toxic ‘artivist’ event has landed in jolly old England, this time with the opening of the“queer techno rave and porn”event being held at the once-esteemed Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. To quote the press release,""Queer techno rave INFERNO take over the ICA s Theatre, Bar and Cinema with an all-night programme of music, queer porn and performance art…the first in a series of all-night takeovers from club collectives exploring nightlife as a realm of self-expression.""Can anyone remember the last time a public exercise in“self-expression”did not require latex apparel, chainmail undies, dog whistles and other assorted paraphernalia? But I digress. In deference again to my British colleague, who previously contributed his thoughts on the situation inside of the ICA and other artistic venues in his homeland:“Arts administrators in the UK live in a social milieu where the highest virtue is tolerance, which means boundaries are being ever expanded,”Adams explained.“Rejection of any activity is considered bigotry…[A]s long as the material or activity is anti-West, anti-white, anti-tradition, pro-gay, pro-minority, pro-mass-migration or ""gender non-conforming"" then it will find a welcoming home at the ICA – no matter the quality of art, or whether it can even be called art, or whether it even pretends to be art.”This begs the question, albeit from a non-British observer: is this really the sort of art ‘exhibition’ the British taxpayer wants, needs or deserves? At the very least, would it be asking too much to leave the alcohol-infused proclivities of the night club beyond the purview of the art gallery? Although a visitor to the Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Florida may expect to confront a number of disturbing historical events, they probably would not expect to find amemorialto George Floyd, the African American who was killed by a white cop during an attempted arrest. Yet to express any reservations over Floyd’s inclusion would, to quote RT commentator Micah Curtis, expose that person to a“Kafka trap,”with the ultimate goal of having the individual“incriminate themselves.”Nevertheless, some observations are necessary. First, it is critical to question the media-generated narrative that ‘America is a fundamentally prejudiced country, ravaged by systemic racism.’ It’s a flawed premise, and applying it to the George Floyd case is questionable at best. As far as the tragic death of Floyd goes, it seems more reasonable to suggest that it was brought about not by some sort of neo-Nazi mentality, but rather a severe problem with regards to police tactics. The problem has very little to do with racism per se, although that is not to say there are no racists in US police forces. At the risk of appearing to focus undue attention on the British art scene, it would be hard to ignore what the writer Mark Hudson has dubbed“one of the great cultural events of the pandemic era,”that is, the tossing of a statue toEdward Colston, a Bristol philanthropist and slave trader, into the River Avon. Aside from Colston’s profiting in human flesh as a reason for his statue being destroyed, Hudson relished in the sight of a ‘live performance’ amid the anti-viral lockdown. “It rapidly became evident that virtual gallery tours are a bore and that when you’ve seen one performance of Beethoven’s Fifth played on kazoos from 30 different sitting rooms in the Home Counties simultaneously via Zoom, you’ve seen them all,”he wrote in the Independent. While I can sympathize with Hudson’s exasperation with being cooped up in a flat or house for many days, to suggest that public displays of vandalism now ranks as one of the“great cultural events of the year”suggests something more than sheer boredom is eating away at this man’s brain. At this stage in the woke movement’s relative infancy (and certainly immaturity) the last thing the young vandals need is encouragement. Yes, Colston probably does not deserve to be immortalized in bronze or stone in the public square, but let’s at least be civil and bring the matter of his ejection to a vote. To applaud the mob as it destroys public property simply because the act is ‘live’ only invites far greater acts of destruction down the road, and especially if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues with his very unpopular lockdown regime. News that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had sent members of his police force to stand guard over a massive blacklivesmatter mural painted on a New York City street captures the absurdity of the woke movement like no other. The mayor’s order comes at a time when BLM is demanding the defunding of the very police they now want to guard their tax-funded work of graffiti (which de Blasio and his wife helped paint, incidentally). The situation is reminiscent of the situation inside of the protesters’ ill-fated Seattle Autonomous Zone, which saw some of the rabble calling the police when their personal safety was threatened. Would Bill de Blasio, plagued as he is by rising crime rates in the Big Apple, consider sacrificing a single police officer to guard a statue to Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln? Sadly, the answer to that question is all too obvious. Although it would be hard to say which social justice art movement was the most asinine in 2020, Slate magazine’s argument that using famous composers’ last names contributes to an atmosphere of“systematic prejudice, exclusion, sexism, and racism”would certainly be in the running. Writing in the liberal publication, Chris White, an assistant professor of music theory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, apparently stayed awake at night wondering how some composers, like Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart, are recognized by just their last names, while others are not. And yes, the article came with the predictable sermon preaching on the subject of white privilege. Professor White, who must be terribly ashamed of his family name, suggested the public use all those dead composers full names so we can“focus more on their music rather than on the past cultural practices that elevated straight white men at the expense of everyone else."" Sorry Oprah, Madonna, Ellen and Beyonce, looks like the mob will be knocking on your door soon, too. Or then again, maybe not. In keeping with the spirit of the holidays, number one on this woke list must go to the famous Russian ballet, The Nutcracker, which first featured at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1892. Having survived a bumpy ride through history’s ups and downs, the ballet performance found its way to the United States where it has become, as in Russia, an annual Christmas favorite. That is, until the social justice warriors got their claws on it. Asreportedin the Christian Science Monitor, many in the dance community have been wondering“if it is possible to transform ‘The Nutcracker’ to remove its racial stereotypes and aristocratic origins while holding onto its traditional charms.” Exactly what did finicky concertgoers find unacceptable with the perennial classic? Well, for starters,“In Act 2, dancers portraying sweets from different cultures (chocolate from Spain, coffee from Arabia, tea from China) appear onstage. The traditional choreography and costumes – particularly in the Chinese section – reinforced stereotypes that are demeaning and offensive.” Has it suddenly become obscene to associate a race of people with their native costume and food? Apparently so, at least for the very small group of people who look upon such national details not with a sense of pride or honor, but with disfavor. I didn’t think it could get worse, but it does. In another spin off of the original, Sam Pott, the founder and director of Nimbus Dance in Jersey City, actually used a term I never thought I’d hear in the same sentence as ‘The Nutcracker.’ For those already familiar with what triggers the radical progressives, you’ve probably already guessed it. Yes, ‘white supremacy.’ “It was important for European immigrants to have shows like the ‘Nutcracker’ that connected them back to their European traditions,”Potts was quoted as saying by CSM.“But sometimes that was wedded to white supremacy.” Now, in the ‘new and improved’ updated version, a multicultural landscape is presented that shows“the safer and kinder Jersey City of their dreams,”he says. And on that note, I will conclude this list. Thanks to those readers who made it this far. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Here’s hoping for a less angst-driven 2021, when people are less prone to look for problems where there are none. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/511039-top-wokies-art-world/
"29 Dec, 2020","In a year ripe for satire, Netflix’s predictable mockumentary Death to 2020 is proof of comedy’s calamitous demise","2020 has been a brutal year, but one that offers huge potential for humor. However, Death to 2020’s tepid, establishment-friendly take on the past 12 months feels like the final nail in the coffin of true comedy. Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Michael McCaffrey is a writer and cultural critic who lives in Los Angeles. His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Death to 2020is the new Netflix mockumentary that sets out to humorously sum up the nightmare that was 2020. The film, which premiered on the streaming service on December 27, recounts the actual terrible events of the past year and has fake ‘experts’, played by actors such as Samuel L. Jackson and Lisa Kudrow, as talking heads to comedically comment upon them. The makers ofDeath to 2020, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, are best known in the US for their terrifically terrifying and unnervingly prescient sci-fi horror showBlack Mirror. But UK viewers first got to know them from their more comedy-oriented projects like theWipeseries. Death to 2020is much more like theWipeseries thanBlack Mirror, as it attempts to be a comedy. Unfortunately, it fails in that endeavor. What makesDeath to 2020so irritating is that it has nothing unique to say, and it doesn’t even say the same tired old stuff uniquely. Granted, some of the jokes are mildly amusing, and some of the performances are good. Tracey Ullman as Queen Elizabeth II, Hugh Grant as a stuffy and ornery British historian and Diane Morgan as one of the top five most average people in the world are well done. Others, such as Leslie Jones as a behavioral psychologist and Lisa Kudrow as a conservative spokeswoman, are decidedly not. Ultimately, the film has the comedic heft, impact and staying power of a snide and snarky tweet. At best, it resembles a high-end, star-studded 2020 version of one of those silly Best of the 80s clip shows on VH1. The biggest problem withDeath to 2020, though, is the problem with most comedy nowadays, in that it is such a suffocating, stultifyingly safe and painfully predictable exercise as to be frustrating and fruitless. If you have seen a single monologue in the past year by any of the sanctimonious, self-righteous serfs to the establishment on late night TV, such as Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Bill Maher, Trevor Noah or John Oliver, then you’ve experienced the same impotent comedy ofDeath to 2020. The tired formula of the late-night comedy eunuchs, where they flaccidly recite establishment-approved witticisms devoid of insight and edge, is dutifully replicated here, just in mockumentary form. The result is, not surprisingly, that there’s not an ounce of originality or profundity found in the hour and ten-minute film, which is too long by roughly an hour. Also, clearly lacking fromDeath to 2020is any semblance of comedic testicular fortitude as the usual safe targets are held up for ridicule. Of course, Donald Trump is pilloried because he is a walking punchline, as is clueless Joe Biden, who, amusingly, is referred to both as a “prehistoric concierge” and a “civil war hero.” But obviously none of that is even remotely daring. ‘Karens’, conservatives and anti-lockdown activists are also the butt of many jokes, but the equally golden opportunity to lambaste the illiberal left for laughs is never taken. For instance, the comedy-rich environment of the blacklivesmatter movement is not mocked, and the ‘protestors’ looting and burning businesses in the name of George Floyd don’t get taken to task either. But most telling is that also absent from the comedy firing line are celebrities, like the highly hysterical dopes and dullards who vomited out the repugnantly self-serving ‘Imagine’ and ‘I Take Responsibility’ videos. By ignoring these subjects,Death to 2020reveals itself to be little more than just another pandering video compliantly committed to kissing the right asses and devoutly dedicated to never biting the hand that feeds it. As George Carlin famously oncesaidof the powerful in America, “it’s a big club and you ain’t in it!” But the establishment court jesters who made Death to 2020 either are desperate to become members or are already in the club, as their resolute refusal to challenge the status quo is a perfect representation of the sad state of comedy in 2020. Yes, there are some notable exceptions, Dave Chappelle andBill Burrbeing the most prominent. But beyond that, whether it be Stephen Colbertweepingon air like one of the buffoons he used to belittle, orJimmy Falloncastrating himself with a cowardly apology for an allegedly offensive blackface bit from 20 years ago, or John Oliver’s pathetic pandering to wokeness, or Saturday Night Live’s fierce commitment to anti-comedy or any of the other mainstream comedians who have groveled and genuflected to those who hold the power in our culture, 2020 has been the absolute nadir for contemporary comedy. The bottom line is that 2020 has been a most brutal year that may have changed our world forever, but it is also rife with profound opportunities for humor. Unfortunately for us, 2020 may also have killed comedy, and Death to 2020 is its decidedly unoriginal and unfunny death knell. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/510993-satire-netflix-death-2020/

Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Here they are, starting on the local level and going all the way up to the top. Minneapolis, Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey simply must be mentioned in any review of performative wokeness in 2020. After the death of George Floyd – an African-American man whose death during a botched arrest was attributed to an officer kneeling on him, rather than Covid-19 or fentanyl present in his system – rioters set a police station and the surrounding block on fire. From there, the riots spread to the neighboring St. Paul and then across America. Frey’s reaction was totake a kneeand wail like a professional mourner at Floyd’s funeral, as if he were best friends with the man. He also tried to join the“protesters”two days later and declare his devotion to social justice, only to bechased offby demonstrators calling on him to resign. He hasn’t been heard from much since. Yet the 13-member city council apparently decided to outdo Frey in public displays of wokeness. Composed of twelve Democrats and one Green, the council first voted to“defund the police”– outright replace the Minneapolis PD with a“reimagined public safety”agency. Except three of them thenhiredprivate security – at taxpayer expense of $4,500 a day – for themselves, saying they had received threats. City council chair Lisa Bender famouslytoldCNN that being able to call the police when your home is being invaded“comes from a place of privilege,”in one of the stupidest statements of 2020. Since then, the council has voted to spend anextra$500,000 to hire new police officers, only to slash the police budget by$8 million– in the name of ‘racial justice’ and ‘equity’ of course. They did so while lamenting the537-percentincrease in carjackings and a 17-percent spike in violent crime in general, as if that was entirely unrelated. For three weeks in June, blacklivesmatter activists and Antifa occupied several blocks of downtown Seattle, declaring it a Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), also known as Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). MayorJenny Durkan, a Democrat, initially insisted it was“not a lawless wasteland of anarchist insurrection”but“a peaceful expression of our community s collective grief and their desire to build a better world.” “We could have the summer of love,”she told CNN. When criticized by President Donald Trump, she shot back:“Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.” Seattle is fine. Don’t be so afraid of democracy.https://t.co/o26PkJnYhA CHAZ protesters, meanwhile,stormedCity Hall and demanded Durkan’s resignation. Eventually, they even showed up outside her house – whose location had been kept secret since Durkan’s days as a federal prosecutor. Only then did Mayor Jenny decide that maybe CHAZ wasn’t a summer of love and democracy, and moved to dismantle the shantytown. As it turns out, the CHAZ-ites had an ally inside the citadel all along: Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a self-avowed socialist, whom Mayor Durkanaccusedof opening City Hall to the protesters and organizing the demonstration outside her residence. Sawant actually admitted she“marched, rallied, and organized”with the local community in the name of racial, environmental and economic justice, and accused Durkan of having“utterly failed working people and communities of color in this city.” The city council sided with Sawant,rejectingDurkan’s request to investigate her actions and saying there were more pressing issues demanding their attention, such as“a civil rights movement demanding we divest from racist, anti-Black systems.”To exactly no one’s surprise, a second CHAZ sprung up in early December. While much of the media attention was on Minneapolis and Seattle, the supposedly nonexistent Antifa joined with blacklivesmatter in Portland, Oregon to besiege a federal courthouse and immigration buildings. Mayor Ted Wheeler pulled a Frey and joined the“peaceful protests”in July, only to get thesame reception. When Trump sent federal agents to crack down on the riots, Wheeler denounced the move.“No thanks. We don’t need your politics of division and demagoguery,”he said in an open letter posted on Twitter at the end ofAugust, channeling Seattle’s Durkan.“Your offer to repeat that disaster is a cynical attempt to stoke fear and distract us from the real work of our city.” Within days, however, he wasforcedto move from his condo after“peaceful protesters”tried to set the building onfire, along with nearby businesses owned by African-Americans. Give the man credit for his obstinate consistency, however: even after all that, Wheeler remains a supporter of the BLM-Antifa brand of wokeness. Several years ago, Democrat mega-donor and globalist financier George Soros decided to pour millions of dollars into local US politics, specifically elections for district attorneys. People who benefited from his largesse signaled their virtue in 2020 by outright refusing to prosecute rioters or even violent criminals, while throwing the book at ordinary people expressing political dissent. In July, DA Diana Becton of Contra Costa County, California actually charged a couple with a“hate crime”for painting over a blacklivesmatter sign. Becton insisted BLM is“an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention.” Some black lives apparently don’t matter to Kim Gardner, Becton’s colleague in St. Louis, Missouri. She ordered the release of everyone involved in the George Floyd riots, which resulted in the death of David Dorn – an African-American retired police captain murdered by looters. Meanwhile, she went after Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a couple who waved a rifle and a handgun to scare off a mob of rioters that barged onto their property. California may be dealing with rolling blackouts, unusually devastating wildfires and mass emigration to other states by people seeking a better life, but that hasn’t stopped Governor Gavin Newsom from pledging allegiance to woke values on an almost daily basis. Citing climate change, which he also blamed for the wildfires, in September Newsom signed a ban on all non-electric cars starting in 2035. This promptedEPAAdministrator Andrew Wheeler to write a scathing letter arguing that the ban“begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet...when you can’t even keep the lights on today.” Newsom was undeterred, proceeding to sign another law that would mandate the state’s prisons to house inmates based on their owngender identity, rather than their sex assigned at birth, prohibiting discrimination based on the inmate’s anatomy. The law is part of California’s“march toward equality”and would help“uphold the dignity”of all state residents, Newsom said. Meanwhile, he has turned all of California into a de facto prison through draconian Covid-19 lockdowns – while exempting himself from the same rules. Whencaughtdining out with lobbyists at the fancy French Laundry restaurant, he shrugged it off by saying he“should have modeled better behavior”and carried on, undisturbed. Lest you think the wokeness is endemic to the Left Coast, there was plenty of it on display in the Big Apple this year as well. Mayor De Blasio was quick to jump on the lockdown train, but abruptly reversed course in June and declared that the virus didn’tapplyto blacklivesmatter protests. Then he personally helped paint blacklivesmatter outside the Trump Tower in an act of“liberating”5th Avenue, as heput it. NYPD was then told to look the other way at crime and guard the sign from peoplesplatteringit with paint instead. Meanwhile, he went after New York City’s OrthodoxJews,singlingthem out for coronavirus lockdown enforcement and condemning theirdefiance. In December, de Blasio ordered the arrest of a Staten Island barownerwho refused his arbitrary orders banning indoor dining. Just a few days later, Hizzoner was on TV talking about schools – which are mostly closed again – and openlydeclaredthat“our mission is to redistribute wealth”during a talk about public schools, arguing it was the only way to deal with“structural racism and segregation.” Hirono (D-Hawaii) is so woke that the Constitution and even the English language can’t contain her. Back in 2018, she famouslyarguedthat Supreme Court nominees don’t have a presumption of innocence because“we’re not in a court of law.”This October, during another SCOTUS nomination, she actually managed to change the dictionary. Mere hours after Hirono made the baffling claim that the term“sexual orientation”was“offensive and outdated,”Merriam-Websteralteredtheir entry to reflect Hirono’s assertion. Now that’s woke! While not a politician as such, the world’s largest museum and research institution complex is funded by the US government. It’s unclear when exactly they decided to endorse the language of critical race theory and intersectional social justice, but this year it was finally noticed. In July, at the peak of the George Floyd riots, a number of people found the ‘Whiteness’ page of the ‘Talking About Race’ series on the website of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture (NMAAHC), part of the Smithsonian Institution. It helpfully explained that self-reliance, nuclear family, the scientific method, delaying gratification, ‘Judeo-Christian tradition’, competitiveness and justice based on protecting property and English common law are all“white”things. The presentation was based on a slide show by corporate consultant Judith H Katz, dating back to the 1990s. Furore over the presentation led to its brief removal from the NMAAHC homepage, and an executiveorderby President Donald Trump in September, banning any sensitivity training that“scapegoated or stereotyped”people on the basis of race, sex or other characteristics. Democrats and diversityconsultantshave urged Joe Biden to rescind the order“on day one.” Not Biden the man, who boasted of authoring the 1994 crime bill and praised KKK Exalted Cyclops Robert Byrd at his funeral – but“Joe Biden”the construct, created by the mainstream media and the Democrat narrative managers as the apotheosis of America’s wokeness. Already woke-adjacent for having been Barack Obama’s wingman for eight years, the 78-year-old white guy from Delaware first burnished his credentials by picking Kamala Harris – or“Indian-Afro-Caribbean Woman Of Color”as the labels go – as his presumptive early replacement. Once the media proclaimed him president-elect, he proceeded to announce a cabinet stacked with“historic firsts”that CNNinsistedamounted to“an administration that looks like and reflects the diversity of America.” Among the“firsts”so far are nominations of African-American men to head Treasury, Defense and EPA, a Native American to head Interior, a Latino as head of Health and Human Services, a“Latino and immigrant”two-fer as head of Homeland Security, and a Hispanic“White House Social Secretary”(we kid you not). Then there are“Women of Color”to be the US Trade Representative and chair the Council of Economic Advisers, while Neera Tanden gets to double-dip and be the“first woman of color and first South Asian American”to run the Office of Management and Budget. Lest we forget, ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen is to be the“first woman as Treasury Secretary.” Proving that he is infinitely more woke than Trump, who only had a woman run the CIA and an openly gay man be the acting Director of National Intelligence,“Biden”nominated a woman to the DNI spot, while CNN breathlessly split hairs to inform America that Pete Buttigieg would be the“first out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary approved by the Senate.” Bright woke future, here we come!

"27 Dec, 2020",‘Did she also celebrate Tupac’s birthday?’ Incredulous internet sleuths take aim at Kamala Harris’ ‘childhood memories’ of Kwanzaa,"Social media users have accused US vice president-elect Kamala Harris of bending the truth after she claimed to have fond memories of celebrating Kwanzaa with her family. Harris released a video message on Saturday in which she wished her supporters a happy Kwanzaa, and said that her own family would be observing the holiday over Zoom. “Our Kwanzaa celebrations are one of my favorite childhood memories. The whole family would gather around across multiple generations and we’d tell stories and light the candles,”she reminisced, as a traditional seven-branched Kwanzaa candle holder was displayed on a table behind her. First celebrated in 1966, Kwanzaa is a pan-African holiday that lasts from December 26 to January 1. Its creator, African Studies professor Maulana Karenga, said the holiday was a way for people of African heritage to“celebrate themselves and their history.”A central figure in the Black Power movement in the US, Karenga himself was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1971, after being found guilty of assaulting and torturing two women. Considering that Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 and Harris was born in 1964, I highly doubt her family “across multiple generations” would have celebrated the holiday.This just comes across as another one of her lame attempts to sound human and in touch with the average voter.https://t.co/mbD895IoRA The vice president-elect, who has mixed Indian-Jamaican ancestry, spent her childhood in California and Montreal, Canada. Social media users immediately pounced on the video message, noting that Harris was born in 1964 in Oakland, California, raising questions about why“multiple generations”of her family would take part in a holiday that hadn’t yet been invented at the time of her birth. “What generations of your family were celebrat[ing] Kwanzaa when you grew up?”askedone suspicious Twitter user. Conservative pundits compared Harris’ comments to a Saturday Night Live sketch, and even left-wing commenters such as Margaret Kimberley, editor of the Black Agenda Report,accusedthe politician of lying about her family traditions. This is funnier than Saturday Night Live in the 90s. 😂 Others shared photographs showing Kamala’s “real” childhood. One picture is of her family in traditional Indian costume, while another photograph documents a family Christmas from 1968. Meanwhile, Kamala s actual childhood:pic.twitter.com/bSXfAZkPSy I found 1, oh wait they are celebrating Christmas!pic.twitter.com/F9pMwJwfEG Given Harris’ background, there was also speculation about why any member of her family would even be interested in Kwanzaa. Her father emigrated to the United States from Jamaica. Although some argued that Kwanzaa is not widely celebrated in Jamaica, the holiday can be observed by all members of the African diaspora. But many still expressed their doubts. “Other holidays that Kamala Harris celebrated with her Tamil Brahmin grandmother in Montreal in the 1970s: Juneteenth, Ramadan, World AIDS Day, The Feast of St. George of Floyd, Tupac Shakur s Birthday,”joked conservative journalist Steve Sailer. Other holidays that Kamala Harris celebrated with her Tamil Brahmin grandmother in Montreal in the 1970s:JuneteenthRamadanWorld AIDS DayThe Feast of St. George of FloydTupac Shakur s Birthday Harris has struggled in the past when trying to connect with African Americans. In a gaffe from September, the California politician declared Tupac to be“the best rapper alive.”The artist had been killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996.

"27 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top-10 BRITISH virtue signalers of 2020 (including a cop and a cleric),"It’s been a great year for a bit of virtue signaling. There s been loads about which to show you REALLY care: blacklivesmatter , statue toppling, the pandemic, pick your poison. Here’s a look at the ten best hits from UK leaders. ByCharlie Stone, author and journalist who has worked for the BBC, several national newspapers in the UK and international media. Trust me. Vote for me. I care. Honestly. I really, really DO care. Virtue signaling for politicians is the modern day equivalent of kissing a baby, downing a pint in a working men s club, going to church or hugging the wife. All for the cameras, of course. Plus it s so very very easy to do. Just take the knee because Black Lives REALLY DO Matter or spout something Woke and with feeling - preferably on social media. You don t actually have to DO much of anything at all and you secretly don t even have to mean it. The definition of virtue signaling is an attempt to show other people that you re a good person. Politicians never want you to think they re a bad person, do they? Here s ten of this year s political best with a cop and a cleric thrown in for good measure: Justin Welby isn t a Catholic, but he has spent an awful lot of his time in the confessional this year. ""I am sorry and ashamed,""the Leader of the Anglican Church said in February.""I m ashamed of our history and I m ashamed of our failure. There is no doubt when we look at our own Church that we are still deeply institutionally racist. “I have white advantage, educational advantage, straight advantage, male advantage … I’m not ashamed of those advantages, I’m ashamed of not knowing I had them.” May I make a suggestion? How about an unconscious bias training course. It only takes a couple of hours, and you ll be cleansed. Just ask Keir Starmer (spoiler alert – he is also on this list). Police officers in uniform should stay clear of making political statements in public. Indeed, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick instructed her officers not to take the knee during protests in London. But Pughsley took the knee at an event in Gravesend, as an act of humility - for the cameras, of course. He cares though, you see, he really really cares:""Our communities can be confident we listen, we work with them to solve problems and we are accountable for the service we provide. We are never complacent and always strive to be better."" Yeah, whatever Alan. Whatever. All of a sudden, in January, an obscure little virus that had first been spotted in a market in an obscure Chinese city called Wuhan was cutting a swathe across the whole globe. For weeks, scientists seemed to know just about as much as the rest of us as it clawed and coughed its way towards every one of us, ie: nothing much at all Barry Gardiner had been socially distancing, like the rest of us, from March. Then something more important came along than the health of himself and his neighbours: he had to join thousands of others and take the knee for a cause. An American black man was killed by a white cop... in America. But, well, blacklivesmatter . Only 48 hours earlier, he d been on the radio saying lockdown needed to be extended. There were others of course, including the MP Tobias Ellwood and broadcaster Piers Morgan, that didn t seem to quite get the hypocrisy. Covid 19 is a virtuous virus though, you see. Spend the day on the beach with your mates and the virus is hitching a ride back home with you on the train to infect everyone within a two metre radius. Take the knee close to thousands of others, however, and the little blighter s receptors know how just your cause is - and they don t attach. Funny that. How George Floyd died was abhorrent to most human beings. Only a racist nut or a true moron would think what that cop did was reasonable. Kneeling on a man s throat for almost nine minutes until he chokes to death is not restraint: it s murder. Plain and simple. Taking the knee began as a protest against the unfair treatment of black Americans, and was made famous by NFL player Colin Kappernick and was picked up by the blacklivesmatter movement after Floyd s death - or, more correctly, after video footage emerged of what happened. One doesn t actually need to take the knee to recognise and accept that what happened to George Floyd was an affront to humanity. But... George Floyd was a black American man killed by a white American cop... in America. It was not within the jurisdiction of any British lawmaker. And it s funny how there is always a camera present at the crucial moment the knee touches the ground. ""Excuse me mate, any nice cafes around here? I m just gagging for a vegan latte!"" "" Course bud. What you wanna do, this time of night, is head down to the bottom of Destiny Road, left onto Inspire Avenue, cross over Respect Way, left onto Equality Road, right onto Diversity Grove and then next left. There s a Woke cafe at the bottom of Humanity Close."" City planners in Birmingham asked locals where 5,000 new homes are being built on the site of the old university campus to come up with some street names, and this non-specific Woke piffle won the day. Say no more. Nadia, my dear, sorry - but you were just too young to become an MP. At 24, you had virtually no life experience whatsoever, and you made it very clear how little you know by the dopey clap-trap you tap into your smartphone. Debate, you see dear, is not a foot in the door for hatred it s a kick in the arse to totalitarianism She tweeted:“We must not fetishise ‘debate’ as though debate is itself an innocuous, neutral act. The very act of debate in these cases is an effective rollback of assumed equality and a foot in the door for doubt and hatred.” Righto Nadia, righto. But debating, err, isn t that actually your new job? Here s a quick lesson, you must have missed this one in school because you were too busy canvassing and putting up posters. Parliament. Like so much of the old stuff in Britain, it began in French. The very word Parliament is derived from the French verb parler - to talk .  Parlez vous français? Vous êtes membre du parlement. These days the Liberal Democrats have enough MPs to field a team in a Parliamentary football match - but only just, and they have no subs if anyone cries off with covid-19. Gone are the glory days when the party held the balance of power with 57 seats and Nick Clegg was kingmaker and deputy PM. Wera Hobhouse is one of those 11 political superstars, and is the party s Justice spokesperson. (Everyone gets a post in the Lid Dems these days, there are more Cabinet equivalent jobs than MPs to fill them.) And Wera s big idea for her tiny, pretty much irrelevant political party? Let s get more people from ethnic minorities into Parliament. Brilliant. Nobody else has ever thought of that one, Wera. The Parliament elected in December 2019 is the most diverse ever. But she wants to go a step further, a step too far. She wants to make it legal to draw up shortlists of candidates that have no white people on them. She tweeted in October.""We cannot hope to beat racial injustice unless the people making decisions genuinely represent our diverse nation."" Here s a suggestion to white, German-born Ms Hobhouse for the new year: give up your own seat to a BAME candidate and hold a by-election. North of the border, and be careful what you say after a little too much mulled wine grandma. As you grumble about a year filled with lockdowns, social distancing and Boris bloody Johnson around the table with the seven other people you re allowed to see on Christmas Day, keep an eye out for anyone writing it all down on a napkin. It won t be a letter to Santa 2021, it ll be evidence for the Justice Department. Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf wants insulting conversations at home between family and friends to be punishable. You d still have the right to be offensive , he said, but“stirring up hatred”against others on the basis of religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity or“variations in sexual characteristics”will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. “Let s just give an example, which is intentionally stirring up hatred against Muslims,”he said.“Are we saying that that is justified because it is in the home?” So? You don t actually have the right to be offensive at all, then? Unless it s offensive to someone who is white, non-religious, straight, not old and not disabled. Then, go ahead - fill yer boots. Got that, grandma? You can still slag off uncle Frank, I ve never seen him in a dress. Have another whisky. It s an unfortunate but statistical fact that a disproportionate amount of violent crime in London is perpetrated by black youths - upon other black youths. But, that simple fact is a political minefield these days for any cop in England s capital city. Stop and search, you see, disproportionately impacts upon... yup, you guessed it, black youths. Of course there must be a racist element to the stats plus you cannot discard the individual idiocy of some very stupid officers. But it s also pretty basic logic, it s pretty basic policing too: try to target the perpetrators. But the number one job of a policeman in Mayor Khan s London is not to actually catch any bad guys or prevent crime, oh no, a cop s number one priority is to put a tick in an ever-lengthening row of boxes. He wants, for example, 40 per cent of new recruits to be of BAME backgrounds by 2022 and he also wants them to be from London itself. That s pretty much only a year away now, let s check in this time next year and see how you re doing with that one, Mayor Khan. That s if you don t get booted out in the Mayoral election in May. Sir Keir, bless him. At heart he s just a stiff and not very exciting lawyer with his Superman hairdo and nice blue suit. The single most interesting thing about Sir Keir is that he s not Jeremy Corbyn. But the new Labour leader s Woke vital statistics were dented in the summer after he described the blacklivesmatter movement as a moment - as in it wouldn t last long. Oops. (He insisted later he d actually meant moment in time , ie: big and important). Something had to be done to repair the damage amongst the perpetually offended. So Sir Keir lifted the proverbial baby out of the pram and gave it a big slobbery kiss, by signing up for a thing called unconscious bias training . That s a course to re-programme prejudiced ways of thinking and assumptions about people because they can unfairly influence decisions, such as who might get a job. ""I think everybody should have unconscious bias training. I think it is important,""he said in July. So the 58-year-old Labour leader purged himself of a lifetime of subliminal bias - hey, it only took a couple of hours - in October, when his spokesman trumpeted that he had passed his unconscious bias training. One has to wonder, though, what does one actually have to do in order to fail? ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/510455-top-british-virtue-signalers/
"26 Dec, 2020",RT’s The Wokies: Top 10 CORPORATE panderers who plumbed new depths in 2020,"Corporations went headlong into performative wokeness this year, falling over themselves to embody the spirit of diversity and inclusion. They mostly succeeded in alienating customers and bringing down torrents of mockery instead. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram While some companies deliberately set out to become woke standard-bearers, donating conspicuous sums to blacklivesmatter or delivering pompous press releases about their new direction, others were pushed into the PC pit unexpectedly - whether through guilt by association or because a publicity-hungry customer was able to bend the ear of a story-hungry tabloid. Perhaps attempting to distract from the revelation that management knew about the shortcomings in the 737 MAX’s onboard computer that killed hundreds of passengers in two crashes within six months, Boeing was quick to embark on an internal witch hunt as blacklivesmatter took over the sociopolitical discourse this summer, wielding the big stick of cancel culture against its own employees. Communications chief Niel Golightly resigned after just six months with the company over a 33-year-old article he’d written arguing against women serving in the military. While he claimed the piece no longer reflected his views, it was nevertheless“embarrassingly wrong and offensive,”Golightly said - to applause from the CEO, who boasted about the company’s“unrelenting commitment to diversity and inclusion in all itsdimensions.” Boeing’splanesmay still be horrificallyunsafe, but at least doomed passengers can die content that the airplane manufacturer has“zero tolerance for bigotry of any kind.” Not to be outdone by the Americans, top Scandinavian airline SAS let its customers know in February that“nothing is truly Scandinavian.”Releasing a commercial claiming that cultural touchstones from Norway, Sweden and Denmark had actually come from elsewhere and declaring those countries’ residents were “no better than our Viking ancestors” in terms of (metaphorical) pillaging, the company seemed surprised when Scandinavians didn’t take kindly to being told they had no culture of their own. SAS ultimately removed the spot - though not before blaming the backlash on“right-wingers”and“hate groups.” Publishing giant Penguin Random House in partnership with Barnes & Noble planned to celebrate Black History Month in February by changing the races of iconic literary characters for 12 re-released editions of young adult classics - confusing those they were trying to pander to (who asked why thepublisherhadn’t just featured works written by actual black authors) and alienating others with the cheap stunt. At the eleventh hour, the“culturally diverse”book launch wasshelved. Buttermaker Land o’ Lakes quietly removed the illustrated Native American woman“Mia”from its logo in February following a handful of complaints from Native academics and politicians that the demure image was somehow playing into“sexualized depictions of Indigenous women.”But far from getting the plaudits it expected for the woke gesture, the company was deluged with bad reviews by customers who resented its kowtowing to political correctness. The son of the Native artist behind the most recent depictions of“Mia”even penned an op-ed for the Washington Post skewering the brand, noting that Land o’ Lakes in true American fashion had“got[ten] rid of the Indian and kept the land.”Ouch. Following Quaker Foods’ decision to dump its“Aunt Jemima”syrup mascot in June, citing the character’s racist origins in the“mammy”stereotype of black women, other companies whose packaging prominently featured black characters rushed to dispose of them in what some observed was an ironic blow against minority representation. Mars’“Uncle Ben”and the nameless black chef gracing B&G’s Cream of Wheat packages were unceremoniously ushered out the door in Jemima’swake. Indeed, the frenzy to dispose of potentially problematic brand emblems reached such a peak that ConAgra Foods opted to discontinue its Mrs. Butterworth syrup - even though the eponymous Butterworth, represented in the product’s“distinctive motherly-shaped bottle,”was merely intended to“evoke the images of a loving grandmother”and has no race at all. Dessert maker Hansens opted to rename its popular“Eskimo”line of chocolate-covered ice cream pops in July after a Danish politician complained the term“Eskimo”means“eater of raw meat”and“has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders.”They weren’t the first to drop the supposedly offensive term - Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, which had been selling chocolate-covered ice cream“Eskimo Pies”for nearly a century, vowed in June to rename the product and change its marketing campaign, which had featured a little boy dressed in ‘Eskimo’ garb against a snowybackdrop. Hansens was lambasted for bending to political correctness, with tens of thousands of“angry”Facebook reactions to thenews. But competitor Premier, which makes a similar product called“Kaempe Eskimo”(Giant Eskimo), opted to keep its name - and presumably a larger share of the chocolate-covered ice-cream pop market. Corporate groveling reached something of a nadir with UK department store chain Marks & Spencer caving to a single bullying customer upset over the names of the colors it offered for bras. The individual complained M&S was naming darker-colored bra shades less favorably than lighter-colored ones - the dark color was called“tobacco”while lighter colors sported names like“cinnamon”and“fudge.”Initially ignored by M&S, shopper Kusi Kimani went to the UK tabloids, at which point the chain began apologizing profusely and promised to solve this most first-world of first-worldproblems. In a year where small businesses, especially restaurants, are struggling to merely keep their doors open, crowdsourced business-rating platform Yelp opted to empower the worst impulses of petty wokesters with a new“business accused of racist behavior alert.”The feature was quickly embraced by Antifa, which reportedly asked its members to begin reporting“any company that’s hanging blue lives [matter] garbage in their store or anything else that’s anti the [ blacklivesmatter ] movement”in the hope of driving such benighted establishments out of business. The racism-alert feature wasn’t even Yelp’s first foray into performative wokeness for 2020 - that honor goes to its collaboration with“Open to All,”a company that makes virtue-signaling window decals marking an establishment as a bastion of tolerance and diversity-training kits for businesses that can’t afford the tens of thousands of dollars it costs to hire a corporate-credentialed“diversity consultant.” When it comes to instilling woke virtues, the dominant thinking is that you can never start kids too young, and Nickelodeon quickly caught on to the power they wielded regarding control of young children’s worldviews. The cartoon-dominated network ran nearly nine minutes of a black screen flashing“I can’t breathe”in time with the contradictory sound of breathing (with a countdown at the top of the screen, in case anyone wasn’t aware that this was going on for as long as some of the channel’s actual shows). While it’s not clear if they expected their pint-size viewers to be familiar with slain Minneapolis man George Floyd or the amount of time he’d spent under a smirking cop’s knee, they presumably assumed the unusually quiet nine minutes would drive children to ask their parents what had happened to their usual brightly-colored entertainment - at which point the parents would presumably choose between explaining Floyd’s death to their formerly innocent kids or shelling out some kind of donation to woke standard-bearers Color of Change to change the subject. Stock exchange Nasdaq announced last month that companies hoping to remain listed on its authoritative index had better start diversifying their boards of directors, meritocracy bedamned. Submitting a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would require companies to include at least one director“who self-identifies as female”and another“who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+,”the exchange raised eyebrows across the financial sector. Nasdaq isn’t the first to prioritize skin-deep diversity over talent or business acumen, either - investment bank Goldman Sachs also declared earlier this year that it would no longer take companies public that didn’t have at least one“diverse”board member, and Credit Suisse recently debuted a new index called“LGBT-350”to encourage investment in companies considered LGBT-friendly places to work. Given the disastrous recession many of the world’s economies have plunged into thanks to government-mandated shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s hard to tell which companies have fallen victim to the longstanding rule of“get woke, go broke.”However, it’s clear many of those with purchasing power are sick of the pandering - and eager to spend their hard-earned cash elsewhere. But with those who set the economic rules - not just Nasdaq, but the entire ESG (environmental, social and governance) financial virtue-signaling apparatus - having embraced the program of all-woke, all the time, it’s not clear if dissatisfied consumers will have any alternatives in the near future. After all, most small businesses are facing certain death at the hands of coronavirus-crazy governments who’d rather“kill ‘em all and let God sort them out”than allow citizens to make their own decisions.

"18 Dec, 2020","‘Was Beethoven black?’ In any normal society, the answer would be no, but we no longer live in a normal society.","Beethoven was not black. But, because of the woke times we live in, the famous composer’s race is still hotly debated. What a way to mark his 250th birthday. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 250th birthday passed on Thursday, and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brusselscelebratedthe iconic composer’s in truly modern fashion: by exhibiting artist Terry Adkins’ 2004 work ‘Synapse’ – a video depicting Beethoven’s frumpy visage morphing into that of a young black man with dreadlocks. The video is part of Adkins’ ‘Black Beethoven’ series, and the transformation is supposed to reflect the artist’s“unwillingness to settle the debate on Beethoven’s race.” Hang on a minute – there’s a debate? Well, yes and no. Beethoven was not black. Born in Bonn, Germany, to Flemish parents in 1770, the composer was byallaccountsas white as the driven snow. However, one 1814 etching of Beethovendepictshim with a dark complexion, and rumors of a Moorish ancestor fueled speculation that if he wasn’t outright black, Beethoven may have been a bit less white than previously thought. The famous Berlin anthropologist, Rudolf Virchow 1821-1902, re, BEETHOVEN S autopsy: ""THE POET OF SOUND HAD A MULATTO FACE...A LOWER JAW PECULIAR TO THE BLACK RACE.""

But it wasn’t grounded in reality. Half a century later, it’s becoming a fact. Nobody in their right mind would try to claim Duke Ellington or Louis Armstrong as white, and Barack Obama is still black, despite his distant Irish roots. So why are we doing the opposite? And why now? We canonized George Floyd this summer. As his gold-encrusted coffintouredAmerica like the reliquary of a saint, crackers everywhere took asymbolic kneeand renounced racism they didn’t know they held until the liberal commentariat told them they did. Our corporate masters pledged allegiance and dollars to blacklivesmatter (BLM), and government officials in the US temporarily suspended coronavirus lockdowns to allow marches and riots in Floyd’s honor. But even before that, we took a look through our history books and thought,“Gee, this could really use more black people.” Black model Jodie Turner-Smith wascastby the UK’s Channel 5 in October to play 16th-century Queen of England Anne Boleyn – a woman who was definitely white. Likewise, the BBC has cast a black Achilles, while American theatergoers have been treated to a black George Washington in ‘Hamilton’, and Brits to a black King Lear, among other posthumous recolorings. Did you know thatQueen Charlotteof England andJackie Onassiswere black? They may have looked white, but the woke crowd has decided to reinterpret the Jim Crow-era “one-drop rule” to claim them as such, and who are we to say otherwise? After all, in 2020 black is not a color. It’s a state of mind. Just ask Shaun ‘Talcum X’ King, Rachel ‘Trans-Black’ Dolezal, or any of the BLM activists whopretendedtobe blackto get ahead in the movement. Who knows? Maybe if Beethoven were alive today he’d be talking up his Moorish roots and penning sonatas for George Floyd. But he’s not, so that’s entirely the stuff of imagination – just like speculation about his race. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/510143-beethoven-birthday-250-black/
"17 Dec, 2020","Shift away from ‘fashionable’ race & gender issues, UK equalities minister suggests – gets HAMMERED by liberal press","Equalities Minister Liz Truss has condemned the woke left’s focus on “fashionable” issues of race and gender, and called on the government to fight poverty instead. The liberal press, however, hounded Truss for her heresy. Speaking at the Centre for Policy Studies think tank on Thursday, Truss declared that the debate in the UK over discrimination should not focus on“fashionable”issues of race, gender and sexual orientation. Instead, she said the government would focus on the“real concerns”of poverty, class division and income inequality between the north and south of the UK. ""To make our society more equal, we need the equality debate to be led by facts, not by fashion,”she said, calling racial and gender quotas, targets and bias training“tools of the left,”the Daily Mailreported. I’ve read that Liz Truss speech and she’s right. Inequality is a disgrace and whoever has been in charge for the last decade should be ashamed of themselves. The 2010 Equality Act created nine protected groups based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Since then, successive British governments have focused on these groups in attempting to create a more equal society. Truss wants this approach put on the back shelf, and on Thursdayannouncedthe Equality Data Programme, a large-scale study that aims to map inequalities based on geographic and class divisions, in what the government calls“a new approach to tackling inequality in the UK.” The apparent shift in priorities comes two days after the governmentscrappedmandatory“unconscious bias training”for civil servants, after a study carried out by Truss’ office found no evidence to suggest this training works. In announcing the decision, Cabinet Office Minister Julia Lopez stated bias training“may not only activate and reinforce unhelpful stereotypes, [it] may provoke negative reactions and actually make people exacerbate their biases.” In the US, President Donald Trump recently banned the teaching of“critical race theory”– whose practitioners coined such terms as ‘white privilege’ and ‘institutional racism’ – in federal agencies, calling it“divisive, anti-American propaganda”that tells white people that they“benefit from racism.” Like Trump, Truss was hammered by the mainstream press for her apparent crackdown on wokeness in government. As she delivered her speech to the Centre for Policy Studies, the Timesreportedthat the Department for International Trade, which she runs, has“the second-worst gender pay gap”in the civil service, with women there earning an average of 15.9 percent less than their male colleagues. A department spokesman put the difference down to“the overall distribution of women across [pay] grades.” The Guardian, meanwhile, published anarticleaccusing Truss of picking too many“white, male trade advisers.”The article also heavily featured a black activist who accused Truss and the Conservative government of embarking on“a clear trajectory that seeks to downplay the reality of persistent race inequality.” Oh man...https://t.co/UNugAGgMqH The Labour Party’s shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova,calledTruss’ remarks a“gratuitous provocation”that dismissed“the devastating impact of discrimination and unfairness in peoples’ day to day lives.” So the Equalities minister thinks there’s too much focus on...equality... and *protected* characteristics...Maybe consider that “poverty and geographical disparities” are actually a result of race, gender, sexuality & class ie systemic bias#LizTrusshttps://t.co/SgcbGgZ544 Liz Truss attempt to separate class from race is divisive garbage. We need to create a fairer society for everyone - but this means recognising that the barriers faced by Black, Asian and other minority ethnic people are facts not fashion .#BlackLivesMatter The activist quoted by the Guardian, Simon Wooley, said Truss’ changes were coming at the wrong time, given the“historic moment when we could make the most fundamental positive change in regards to race equality ever seen.”Indeed, racial issues dominated the news globally in the latter half of 2020, following the death of George Floyd in the US. Surprisingly for the mainstream media, the public may be on Truss’ side. Apolllast month found that more than half of UK adults believe that the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ movement“increased racial tension.” ",https://www.rt.com/uk/510002-truss-race-gender-equality-fashionable/
"17 Dec, 2020",Seattle politician who defunded police calls cops after being targeted in attack that could be decriminalized by her own proposal,"A Seattle councilwoman who voted to slash the city’s police budget called the cops after her home was attacked, local media reported. Ironically, the culprit could avoid charges under a plan introduced by the politician. Councilwoman Lisa Herbold phoned 911 on Friday after an unidentified man threw a rock through a window of her West Seattle home,accordingto local outlet My Northwest. A neighbor who witnessed the attack said the culprit was an“unathletic”white male who was wearing a black hoodie and jeans. Unfortunately for Herbold, if the perpetrator is eventually identified he could potentially be let go if the city adopts the councilwoman’s own criminal code reforms. Herbold is currently co-sponsoring a proposal that would make Seattle the first municipality in the US to excuse misdemeanor crimes if they are linked to poverty or addiction, or if the suspect suffers from “symptoms of a behavioral health disorder.” According to Washington state law, a“mental disorder”can be caused by“emotional impairment”which affects a person’s“cognitive or volitional function.”My Northwest noted that anyone who claims to have suffered from an anxiety attack could be given leniency under Herbold’s proposal. Herbold previously defended the reforms as a way to reflect Seattle’s“values.” “It’s giving people an opportunity to tell their stories and giving judges and juries the opportunity to hear those stories and make a decision based on the values of our city,”Herbold told the City Council s Public Safety Committee on Tuesday. However, when contacted by Fox News, she said that her proposal had been mischaracterized by media and insisted that there are“no crimes that I am ‘effectively pushing to make legal.’” Whatever her intentions, Herbold has been a vocal supporter of initiatives to reimagine how Seattle maintains law and order. In September, she and other City Council members voted to override Mayor Jenny Durkan’s veto of budget adjustments that cut the city’s police department funding by $3 million. In a statement from last month, Herbold said the council was pursuing a“new approach towards public safety, an approach that does not assume that more officers means more safety.” Seattle is one of many cities across the United States which saw efforts to strip police departments of resources following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police in May. In July, the city reported a 525 percent spike in crime, reportedly due to the lawless and short-lived“autonomous zone”established by anti-police protesters.

"13 Dec, 2020",‘Racist cowards’: Fans and players horrified as Champions League winner and football ace girlfriend cop ‘sickening’ online abuse,"Bayern Munich prodigy Alphonso Davies and Paris Saint-Germain star Jordyn Huitema have been barraged with vile racial abuse under an innocent holiday snap on Instagram, leading supporters and players to speak of their shock. The photogenic pair were bombarded with racist comments under a shot they had shared of themselves posing on a boat in Ibiza, which 19-year-old Huitema affectionately described as a ""baecation"". Almost four months after the picture had first been posted, a targeted campaign of poisonous comments appeared based around the colour of Davies s skin, variously calling the defender a ""monkey"", an ""animal"" and trumpeting archaic slurs about his ancestry and suitability as a partner and potential father. Davies has supported the blacklivesmatter campaign this year, joining his Bayern teammates to wear an armband in support of social justice following the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police brutality in the US in May. Totally disgusted to read the comments under the photos of@AlphonsoDaviesand@JordynHuitema. No words for that except that you should never listen to people full of hate posting cowardly on social media. We don t give them a chance, love is stronger than hate!#NOTORACISM @instagramshould be embarrassed for not doing better. Those are extremely racist comments, I’ve reported some and they claim to not have an issue. Just brutal. People posting things as disgusting as that deserve legal repercussions. Speaking a month later, he toldSky Sports:""It hurts a lot, seeing all these photos of cops killing black males. ""I don t know what to say, it s just a very sensitive topic to talk about right now. All I want to say is that my skin color is not a crime."" Huitema used her Instagram account to take part in the Blackout Tuesday initiative, in which people around the world posted a black square as a symbol against racism. Unspeakable. What we can do is let Jordyn and Alphonso know that we support them; and hopefully our voices drown out those who have nothing better to do with their lives than spread hate. Disgusting excuses of humans. It’s just fear, man. Straight up fear. You know why they’re scared? If they had kids, they’d turn Canada into an unstoppable force in international football. Other countries wouldn’t have a hope in hell! 😂 She has been dating Davies since around the same time as they were both named Canada Under-17s players of the year in 2017, and the couple are known for their playfully intimate posts to their combined Instagram following of more than 4.2 million. Shocked readers said the obscenities were further evidence of the work needed to eradicate racism from sport.""It’s crazy, the type of stuff people say and get away with,""rued one. ""People filled Jordyn’s Instagram comments with disgusting and racial remarks. It’s 2020 and here we are...still."" So brutal. Two of the nicest, most genuine people you could meet and they are subjected to this. What is wrong with people?? I’m so sorry to read this ! It’s so hurtful but racism exists and these sick people need to be charged. These people are low lives which only attract hate and negativity in their lives. They look for any little bit of information to try and hurt other people but I hope that everyone knows that we don t share these feelings nor will we let these thugs threaten us. Another added:""I’m so sorry to read this. It’s so hurtful but racism exists and these sick people need to be charged.""

"11 Dec, 2020",Frontline healthcare heroes & ‘racial justice organizers’ named TIME’s (mutually exclusive?) Guardians of the Year,"Time has designated frontline health workers – and racial justice organizers – as ‘guardians of the year,’ though lockdown-violating BLM protesters would seem to fly in the face of doctors’ guilt-inducing orders to ‘stay home.’ Apparently trying to have its cake and eat it too, Time named“frontline health workers”– a crowd-pleasing category – and“racial justice organizers”as“guardians of the year,”a newly devised category for its coveted“Person of the Year”selection. I get that the person of the year stuff is Time’s big thing, but creating a secondary “guardian of the year” *and* awarding it to two different entire categories of people seems a bit overboardpic.twitter.com/0VETHEVRT8 However, the magazine’s selections served up a decidedly mixed message, as a video clip representing the health workers reminded the audience that“frontline workers are risking their lives to help save ours”and a voice-over chided Americans for sending hospitals pizzas and other goodies:“What we need is for you to stop exposing us.” Frontline health workers are risking their lives to help save ours. “Doctors, nurses, housekeeping, the clerks, we are the closest to your family right now. And we’re going to take care of them""#TIMEPOY""pic.twitter.com/RdVHIhP88O Yet blacklivesmatter initially reemerged in a series of lockdown-violating protests back in May following the killing of Minneapolis man George Floyd and has somehow received special dispensation – from the media, if not always from authorities – to carry on in cities across the US even as other protests were quashed and demonized. While the frontline health workers were a popular pick, some couldn’t help but notice that the underpaid and often under-appreciated members of that category could use more concrete assistance than a splashy magazine cover. #TIMEPOYpic.twitter.com/n66Jq3qNao And others observed that the ever-broadening range of“People of the Year”diluted the purpose of the awards.

"10 Dec, 2020",Bowing to BLM: Minneapolis knocks $8mn from police budget despite record crime levels,"Despite an extraordinary surge in all crime, particularly violent offenses, Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to cut some $8 million from the city’s already faltering police department. Beset by blacklivesmatter protests and calls to defund police, the city council at least partially acceded to the activists’ demands and will instead redirect the funding to violence-prevention initiatives and mental health services. However, crime statistics paint a grim picture awaiting the social and mental health care workers who will soon be called upon to fill the breach left by the embattled city police department. There were some 532 gunshot victims in the city this year, as of last Thursday – more than double the figure at the same point in 2019 – while carjackings have spiked some 331 percent to 375 so far this year. The total number of violent crimes surpassed 5,100 – up over 1,000 from the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, some 160 trained police officers have quit or taken leave following a firestorm of protests throughout the summer following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis PD custody on May 25 which prompted worldwide demonstrations, regardless of the coronavirus pandemic. “We all share a deep and abiding reverence for the role our local government plays in service of the people of our city,”Mayor Jacob Frey said of the budget cuts. “And today, there are good reasons to be optimistic about the future in Minneapolis,”he added, apparently oblivious to the soaring crime rates in the city. However, the council did perform an about-face on a previous proposal to cut the city’s police force cap from 888 to 750 beginning in 2022, which the mayor described as“irresponsible.” City council member Steve Fletcher, co-author of the budget-cut proposal, said that the new motion to cut $8 million from the department’s budget“represents a compromise, and also a big step forward into a more compassionate and effective public safety future.” Meanwhile, Police chief Medaria Arradondo informed the council that the police department would need more overtime to counter the rising tide of violent crime in the city, in addition to managing the protests expected to accompany the trial of the officers involved in Floyd’s death, which is due to begin in March. The new cuts will compound the existing $14 million cut to the Minneapolis police department budget as a result of austerity measures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The police department has already been diminished by the poor conduct of its officers which led to Floyd’s death, compounded by a slew of retirements, poor morale and reported PTSD among officers involved in crowd-control operations over the summer.

"10 Dec, 2020",Victory for free speech or empty rhetoric? Cambridge University pledges to ‘tolerate’ all views – but not everyone is convinced,"Cambridge University has voted to encourage ‘tolerance’ rather than ‘respect’ for all viewpoints, in what has been described as a rare defeat for ‘woke’ activism in academia. But some say there’s little reason to celebrate. The university’s Regent House, which comprises academic and senior administrative staff, overwhelmingly backed three amendments concerning language in the institution’s ‘Statement on Freedom of Speech’. The most controversial of the three proposed changescalledfor the statement to be altered to make it“clearer and more liberal”. The amendment took issue with several phrases, including the assertion that staff, students and visitors should be“respectful”of the“diverse identities of others”, arguing that“tolerant”would be a more appropriate word. The two other approved amendments added language to the statement which stressed that Cambridge was committed to“the completely free and open discussion of ideas”, and that guest speakers and student events could be barred only in extreme circumstances. Commenting on the result of the ballot, Vice-Chancellor Professor Stephen Toope said the successful amendments served as “an emphatic reaffirmation of free speech in our university”, adding that Cambridge would remain an institution where unpopular opinions could be expressed and vigorously debated. Rigorous debate is fundamental to the pursuit of academic excellence, and the University of Cambridge will always be a place where freedom of speech is not only protected, but strongly encouraged. Many on social media seemed to agree with how Toope characterized the vote. British writer and journalist Douglas Murraysaidthe approved amendments were a“win”for freedom of speech. One observer expressedhopethat the vote signalled that people were“waking up from the stupor of woke”. But others said it was too little too late, and warned it would be premature to celebrate. Many pointed to Cambridge’s decision last year to rescind its offer of a visiting fellowship to Canadian professor and author Jordan Peterson, arguing that the institution appears to be selective with its“tolerance”. Yeah, but ... I suspect this comes as a result of defending Priyamvada Gopal.I mean, where was this spirit when Jordan Peterson was rudely rejected for instance?https://t.co/v7eHhl17Bi One Twitter user claiming to be a student at the university expressed dismay that the trades union for academic staff at Cambridge had urged its members to vote against the amendments. “Most ignored them in the anonymous vote, so it’s a vocal minority pushing for this. But will they still be a minority in 5-10 yrs?”the student asked. There s a danger of minimising the threat here.@CambridgeUCUadvised members to vote against the amendments, with the support of our student union.

(Bangs head against wall.)https://t.co/xKlxUyBQ0i In recent months, the prestigious educational institution has become a battleground in the ongoing ‘culture war’ over issues of social justice and freedom of expression.

"7 Dec, 2020",‘Wear a mask’ has been named the most notable quote of 2020 – because ‘do what you’re told’ was too on the nose,"The celebration of unquestioning obedience accompanying the Covid-19 pandemic has turned individuals into spineless drones. Nothing makes that clearer than corona czar Fauci’s “wear a mask” scold being named quote of the year. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Out of every phrase written or uttered over the past twelve months, Yale Law School librarian Fred Shapiro chose Anthony Fauci’s finger-wagging“wear a mask”as the top quote of 2020, as if to administer one last slap in the face to free will and rational thought. It is a very sick society indeed that celebrates knee-jerk obedience to an ever-shifting narrative and praises fear as the highest form of human emotion. Fauci’s quote and nine others are set to be included in the Yale Book of Quotations, a compendium of memorable epigrams, witticisms, slogans, and other short lines. Shapiro has previously explained he selects quotes that are“famous or revealing of the spirit of the times”rather than“eloquent or admirable”.But putting a banal, borderline-meaningless diktat like“wear a mask”next to famous lines such as PT Barnum’s“There’s a sucker born every minute”andFrederick Douglass’“Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will” comes off like a bad joke. After all, it’s not just the coronavirus commissar’s banality rounding out the top 10. Most of the other quotes selected for 2020 represent vapid political sniping so forgettable the average reader will scarcely be able to recall when they were said, let alone by whom, come the end of the year. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s throwaway pledge during her first press briefing back in May(“I will never lie to you. You have my word on that”)somehow made number five, while Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s bizarre“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black”outburst on Charlamagne tha God’s radio show clocked in at number seven. The closest thing to a meaningful statement among the top 10 was“I can’t breathe” –the last words of police brutality victim George Floyd, which have become a rallying cry for the blacklivesmatter movement. But even that phrase has been cheapened into a slogan to be sold as a souvenir ofcorporate-friendly ’resistance’and shouted during ritualistic protests that authority tolerates as a release valve for popular frustration. Heralding petty political divisions and cultlike appeals to obedience as “quotes of the year” suggests the American body politic is so hopelessly lost that any rule handed down with a patina of authority is immediately followed. After all, Fauci initially advised Americansagainstwearing masks, making the selection of his reversal as the year’s top quote all the more baffling. The health official told the ‘60 Minutes’ show back in March that“there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,”explaining that,“when you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people ‘feel’ a little bit better … but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.” Guidance on masks has shifted repeatedly since then, with each new iteration held up as the absolute truth to which all must bow or risk ostracism (or at least a hefty fine). The World Health Organization, which initially acknowledged universal masking for healthy people wasoverkill, declared last week that everyone shouldwear masks inside. Some local health authorities are even calling for masks to be worn at home – even as the science concerning themremains inconclusiveat best and flaws emerge in the‘gold standard’Covid-19 test itself. The media establishment has been treating humans like foie gras ducks since the start of the pandemic, taking advantage of the captive audience served up by lockdown to force-feed gallons of fear-porn down their throats. We’re told again and again that it’s a terrifying world out there and only stern, finger-wagging authority figures can save us – thinking too hard merely transmits the virus. It’s no wonder so many are wallowing in throwaway lines from insult comics masquerading as politicians, or melting at the sound of Fauci or Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates threatening a long, dark winter if we don’t sit down, shut up, and mask up. But if the best we as a society can come up with for a year-defining quote is“wear a mask,”we might as well throw in the towel on any pretense of having free will or independent thought. Humanity is better than this, and no amount of dull-witted gaslighting will convince the truly free to love their chains. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"6 Dec, 2020","How blacklivesmatter , a Marxist political movement, toppled the establishment to become Art’s #1 powerbrokers","Arts Review has named BLM as the most dominant force in the art world – the first time a movement rather than an individual has been voted top.

Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist is an artist, art critic and author. Hisbook‘Iconoclasm, Identity Politics and the Erasure of History’ is published by Societas. Follow him on Twitter@AdamsArtist A 2020 “power list” issued by a leading arts magazine this week names blacklivesmatter as the most powerful force in the art world. This assessment from Art Review may appal and discourage, but it is entirely accurate. This year, BLM has swept across the West like wildfire (figuratively and literally), inspiring mobs to topple statues, deface monuments and burn buildings. Even so, too few people realise how deeply arts administrators back this self-avowed Marxist political movement. Far from striking from outside the establishment, BLM’s hostility to traditional European and American culture is entirely in tune with mainstream thinking within the arts, academia and government. A new generation (trained in identity politics and grievance studies at university) believes it must back activism. It is not so much a question of staff choosing between personal politics and duty – many organisations have diversity, equity and inclusion policies that institute social justice as organisational policy. When the BLM protests (quickly followed by riots) arose after the death of George Floyd in late May, the art world was keen to quickly get involved. TheTateissued a statement backing BLM. Artists donated to the movement and arranged auctions. Creative Capital, which “funds innovative and adventurous artists... who shape the future”outlinedhow to support BLM. The New York Times listed a graffitiedstatueof Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia as its number 1 example of protest art in the last 75 years. BLM-supporting London Mayor Sadiq Khan vowed to“diversify”the city’s monuments and place names. The director of the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London celebrated the toppling of the Bristol statue of Edward Colston. Hewroteenthusiastically: “They all need to go!” (A bold statement for a registered charity, which is forbidden by law from engaging in political campaigning.) The ICA is a centre ofartivism, dependent on public funding and donations because it has a tiny audience. ItsTwitteraccount supposedly has 190,400 followers, but most of its posts have between 2 and 8 “likes”. So much for contemporary art, but how could a movement linked to iconoclasm be embraced by historical museums? Sympathy for BLM’s narrative of racial injustice, however, is widespread in museums. Linking slavery to the foundation of the USA – apparent in The New York Times’sthe 1619 Project, a political (and biased) reinterpretation of history – started in 2019 and had already paved the way for BLM. The association of museum professionals in the UK hasstated, “We unreservedly support initiatives to decolonise museums and their collections”. It actively demands increased state support while wishing to use museums as political platforms – only promoting one side of the political spectrum, naturally. Museum staff are embarrassed by historical artefacts and terrified of being accused of elitism or racism. So, when the riots and protests broke out, the museum sector was willing to bend the knee. The British Museum engaged in the symbolichumiliationof its founder, citing slavery links. In the summer, the Smithsonian in Washington DC, issued a guide to“white culture”that was so controversial it had to be withdrawn. Museums in Western Europe hastened to put ondisplaysabout European culpability for slavery. Only a few historians have been brave enough to point out that displays and repatriations are often gravely biased. In a recentessay, historian Robert Tombs has written of how museums have presented distorted understandings of slavery. While the North Atlantic slave trade is well documented and commemorated, other slave trades go unmentioned. Tombs’s example is enslavement and brutality by the Asante (or Ashanti) people in West Africa. Researching my latest book, I read histories of Aztec slavery and human sacrifice. There is no part of the world – and no race – that has not at some time engaged in slavery. Portraying the North Atlantic slave trade as uniquely evil is a central tenet of American race activists, including BLM. Dwelling on slavery is encouraged by lucrative industries of academia, publishing and consultancy. A glimmer of hope comes with resistance of black intellectuals such as Coleman Hughes. In hisreviewof Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility, Hughes calls it a “masterful exploitation of white guilt” and “zealotry disguised as scholarship”. But for white arts professionals to break ranks to condemn BLM’s tacit support for mass vandalism, destruction and looting of property is a rare act. A climate of fear in the arts prevents honest discussion of race activists’ violence against cultural material. BLM has come to dominate the art world not by kicking open museum doors but by being invited inside. However, if artists and curators think BLM is simply a modern extension of the civil rights movement, they are in for an unpleasant awakening… ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/508717-black-lives-matter-establishment/

The newly announced BLM political action committee (PAC) and Grassroots entities were set up without the chapter approval – or even knowledge.“[All] of these events occurred without democracy,”the chapters said. This state of affairs isn’t exactly new. Between July 2017 and June 2019, the Global Network had spent $4.5 million on consultants, travel and salaries while giving only $328,000 to local chapters, according to theDaily CallerNews Foundation. What’s new is that BLM fundraising went stratospheric in May this year, as riots over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota spread across the nation – and evenglobally. BLMGN raked in millions using ActBlue, the fundraising platform serving the Democratic party, and while legions of fact-checkers insisted that none of that funding spilled over to the DNC or any campaigns, the Democrats admitted they also had a record fundraising haul paralleling the Floyd riots. As the African-American activists gave the party a piggyback ride yet again, the very least they could have got out of the deal was some cash for their trouble. Not only did the BLM chapters not get that, they also bore the brunt of the backlash against rioting, arson, andproperty destructioninflicted by the riots on their own communities. It was a win-win for the self-styled leadership, lose-lose for the actual footsoldiers on the ground. What blacklivesmatter chapters don’t understand is that the system they’ve embraced is working exactly as intended. They may have forgotten, and the mainstream media certainly hates reminding anyone, that Cullors boasted in a 2015interviewthat she and BLMGN co-founder Alicia Garza were“trained Marxists.” “We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories. And I think that what we really tried to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk,”Cullors told Jared Ball of The Real News Network. Having been trained in Marxism myself many years ago, in a country that’s no longer around, I recall all too well how in“scientific socialism”everyone is supposed to contribute according to their ability and receive according to their need. What happens in practice, however, is that this incentivizes the needs to grow – and abilities to diminish. That’s even before the people in charge – who already believe they are “more equal than others” by the virtue of that, as George Orwell put it in ‘Animal Farm’ – decide that their needs are near-infinite. And since there’s a finite amount of wealth to be re-distributed, that means the needs of the many must amount to nearly nil. When the two inevitabilities converge… well, you get the picture. Therefore, it is only right and proper that the activists on the ground get nothing while the leaders such as Cullors, or the Democrats piggybacking on the movement, get to laugh all the way to the bank. Complain all you want, but this is part and parcel of the ideology you signed up for. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/508736-black-lives-matter-money-marxism/
"4 Dec, 2020",Leader of black-only NFAC militia ‘Grandmaster Jay’ arrested and faces 20 years in prison on federal charges,"John Fitzgerald Johnson, better known as ‘Grandmaster Jay,’ was arrested and charged with pointing a rifle at federal agents and Louisville, Kentucky police during a protest, which could land him in prison for 20 years. Johnson was arrested on Thursday and booked into a Louisville jail on federal charges, NBC affiliateWAVE-TVreported. Independent journalist Ford Fischer posted photos of the charging documents. The final federal charge is for allegedly ""Assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees.""This is a 20-year felony.pic.twitter.com/ANgVu5BL9q The incident allegedly took place on September 4, when Johnson and his NFAC (Not F**king Around Coalition) gathered to protest against the killing of Louisville, Kentucky resident Breonna Taylor in a police raid. While Taylor was fatally shot in March, protests escalated following the May death of George Floyd in Minnesota and the subsequent wave of blacklivesmatter riots across the US. According to the affidavit, Johnson pointed his rifle in the direction of Louisville PD officers – who were apparently federally deputized – looking over the crowd of protesters from the rooftops of nearby buildings. Though heavily armed, the NFAC has not actually committed any acts of violence during the protests it was involved with. On one occasion, at the end of July, a member of the group accidentally shot himself and two colleagues with his own rifle at a Louisville protest. The group showed up in Lafayette, Louisiana in September and marched to chants of“Black Power”to protest against the police shooting of Trayford Pellerin, an African-American man killed the month before. One person was arrested for accidentally discharging a firearm during that protest, but the NFAC told reporters that the person was not part of their organization. Johnson has no prior convictions and reportedly served in the US military in the 1990s. He is a black separatist, who told RT that he wants the US to“give us our own land here, so we can go in, set up our own government and the whole nine yards”during an exclusive interview in June. His long-term goal, however, is“an exodus to Africa, to establish our destiny and build our own nation – and get a seat at the UN like everybody else,”he said.

"3 Dec, 2020",Massachusetts set to become first US state to ban use of facial recognition by police,"Massachusetts is a governor’s signature away from forbidding its police from using facial recognition technology. There are no federal laws regulating the tech, which critics say is flawed and biased against communities of color. On Tuesday, the state House and Senate voted in favor of a police reform bill, introduced in the wake of the killing of African-American man George Floyd, and subsequent ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests across the US. It now needs to be signed by Massachusetts governor, Charlie Baker, to become a state law. The reform almost entirely bans the use of biometrical surveillance by law enforcement and public agencies in Massachusetts. There’s only one exception: police will still be able to run facial recognition searches against the state’s driver’s license database. This will only be possible with a warrant, however. Law enforcement will also be obliged to publish transparency reports every year, with data on how many such warrants had been issued. The bill also outlaws chokeholds and rubber bullets, while placing restrictions on tear gas and other crowd-control means in the arsenal of security agencies. However, qualified immunity for the police, which protects serving officers from legal action for misconduct, has been left inplace. The State Police Association of Massachusetts blasted the reform, saying that it“misses the mark.”According to the law enforcers, the initiative only“creates layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and costly commissions staffed by political appointees with no real-world experience in policing and the dangers officers face every day.” Local authorities are forced to act on the use of facial recognition technology on their own, given the lack of any US federal legislation regulating the controversial issue. It has already been banned by Portland, Boston, San Francisco, Oakland in Northern California and some other cities. Massachusetts may see the introduction of the first ever state-wide curbs. The harshest restrictions so far have been introduced in Portland, Oregon, which has seen months of violent clashes sparked by police brutality. The city has barred not only all of its agencies from using facial recognition, but also made it illegal for such tech to be deployed in public spaces by private companies. The facial recognition technology, which in many evokes daunting associations with Big Brother from George Orwell s dystopian novel‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’has long faced criticism for being flawed and for disproportionately misidentifying people from communities of color. “No one should have to fear the government tracking and identifying their face wherever they go, or facing wrongful arrest because of biased, error-prone technology,”Kade Crockford, who heads the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, told TechCrunch, welcoming the vote by the local legislators. Major tech companies have been acknowledging both technical and legal issues regarding facial recognition. In June, IBM announced that it will stop developing the technology altogether, while Amazon vetoed the police from using its biometrical surveillance platform for a year, saying that it wanted to give Congress“enough time to implement appropriate rules.” State laws however, don t stop federal authorities from expanding their own use of facial recognition. The controversial Clearview AI company – which, from among other sources, relied on social media sites to compile its database of billions of images – has already signed contracts with several government agencies. The latest deal was struck with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in August. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/508547-massachusetts-facial-recognition-police-ban/
"2 Dec, 2020",‘Yes we can’t?’ Obama scorched after denouncing ‘defund the police’ as just a ‘snappy’ slogan that alienates voters,"Former US president Barack Obama has been scolded, most notably from some of his own fellow Democrats, for commenting that “snappy” slogans like the progressive rallying cry to “defund the police” only alienate potential voters. “You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you re actually going to get the changes you want done,”Obama said in an interview on Snapchat show ‘Good Luck America’ set to be broadcast on Wednesday, according to Axios. The Democrat advocated a supposedly more pragmatic approach, saying, “The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?” The call to“defund the police”was popularized during the wave of anti-racism protests and riots, which swept the US following the killing of African American man George Floyd during arrest by Minneapolis Police. Since then, it has been used by activist groups like blacklivesmatter and even some politicians. It has been widely argued that the simplicity of the phrase“defund the police”might lead Americans to believe it’s a push to disband law enforcement altogether. While in actuality, its proponents say it is a call for reallocation of some state funds towards social services like housing and mental health-care. Progressive Democrats immediately broke ranks with the ex-president, berating him for making light of the situation and schooling him on the difference between ‘slogans’ and ‘policy.’ “It’s not a slogan but a policy demand,”tweeted Minnesota Congresswoman and ‘Squad’ member Ilhan Omar. Missouri’s Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush also responded to Obama, saying that while she is concerned with losing people electorally,“We’re losing our loved ones to police violence”and that ‘Defund the Police’ is“a mandate for keeping our people alive.” “There s been a whole lot of talk about which phrases help or hurt electoral campaigns. I’ve seen VERY little talk about which strategies actually solve the crisis at the center,”wrote Jamaal Bowman, incoming congressman for New York’s 16th District. We lose people in the hands of police. It’s not a slogan but a policy demand. And centering the demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country gets us progress and safety.https://t.co/Vu6inw4ms7 With all due respect, Mr. President—let’s talk about losing people. We lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We’re losing our loved ones to police violence.It’s not a slogan. It’s a mandate for keeping our people alive. Defund the police.https://t.co/Wsxp1Y1bBi There s been a whole lot of talk about which phrases help or hurt electoral campaigns.I ve seen VERY little talk about which strategies actually solve the crisis at the center.We re here to solve things right? Talking about talking isn t doing that. The backlash to Obama’s words did not remain inside the beltway, and his own famous“snappy”campaign slogan from 2008 ‘Yes We Can’ started trending on Twitter, as commenters mocked him for hypocrisy. Critics derided Obama for relying on“empty”rhetoric, reminding readers that during his own eight years in the White House Democrats lost both the House and the Senate to Republicans.“Snappy slogans like “Yes we can,”of course, are awesome because they are vague and promise nothing,” tweeted one person. Snappy slogans like ""Yes we can,"" of course, are awesome because they are vague and promise nothing. ""Defund the Police"" implies specific policies that politicians will then be accountable for. Folks, you only win people with empty slogans like ""yes we can"". ""Yes, we can"" literally lost thousands of seats in 8 years.Those who ran on Defund the police didn t lose and only those who let their opponents control the narrative of what DTP means lost. Obama literally won the presidency on the slogans “yes we can” and “change”. The latter of which is ONE word.The only difference is that “Defund the police” is a slogan with actual policies behind it. Policies that are made clear in the slogan itself Some took a jibe at Obama’s slogan by combining it with the current rallying cry tweeting“Yes We Can defund the police.” oh sorry, Yes We Can defund the policehttps://t.co/m0qqdLIoWz While the backlash was fierce, some fully agreed with Obama, saying that“far-left”slogans like“defund the police”do indeed drive voters away. The far-left would rather throw temper tantrums over President Obama calling out their dumb slogans than admit the consequences of their actions-and how it played right into the@GOP s hands.""Yes we can"" brought people together.""Defund the Police"" drives them away. Period. Obama is RIGHT and It s really amazing and baffling that people think of ""Yes We Can"" and ""Change"" in the same light as ""Defund the Police."" It s really really worrying that the need to trend on Twitter and social media has clouded every ounce of pragmatism in today s ""activism.""https://t.co/T89Ly7XsUc ",https://www.rt.com/usa/508448-obama-defund-police-slogan/
"2 Dec, 2020",Minneapolis sees shocking 537% spike in carjackings as City Council pushes for ‘irresponsible’ cuts to police budget,"Minneapolis has suffered a surge in crime that has coincided with a severe shortage of police officers. Undeterred, City Council members want to make further cuts to law enforcement. Police have registered a 537-percent increase in violent carjackings in the city compared with last November, the local Star Tribunereported. More than 125 such crimes have been recorded over the past two months, with three separate carjackings reported within a one-hour period on Saturday morning. One of the victims, an elderly woman, was struck on the head by her assailants. “The numbers are staggering,”a Minneapolis police spokesperson told the paper.“It defies all civility and any shred of common human decency.” Authorities have blamed the crime wave on“small groups of marauding teens,”but acknowledged that adults have also been arrested in connection to the string of carjackings. The surge in this type of attack has prompted the city’s police force to create a new coding system to help keep track of the criminal acts. The spree of carjackings isn’t the only public safety crisis facing the city: Ananalysisby the Star Tribune in September found that violent crimes – including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assaults – were up 17 percent from the previous five-year average for this period. More than 500 people have been shot in Minneapolis so far this year, the highest number of gunshot victims in more than a decade. The Minnesota metropolis has also seen 79 homicides since January, a figure approaching the record annual murder count of 97 in 1995, which earned the city the title of“Murderapolis”in the New York Times. The city has seen a mass exodus of officers since the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police in May, which triggered violent, nationwide protests and campaigns to ‘defund’ law enforcement. Minneapolis has lost 120 officers since the start of the year, with more personnel expected to depart in the coming weeks. In mid-November, the City Council allocated nearly $500,000 to bring in cops from other departments to help until the end of the year. Despite the crime surge and personnel shortage, a trio of City Council members, including Council President Lisa Bender, havesubmitteda proposal that would cut the Minneapolis police budget by nearly $8 million. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo have condemned the plan, with Frey describing it as“irresponsible and untenable.” The proposal calls for more resources to be allocated for alternative forms of policing. Frey said he supports the idea but that cutting the number of police would be disastrous for the city. “This is literally a life and death matter right now and we need to get it right,”he warned on Monday.

The delegation of five players and five union executives met with Pope Francis in the papal library of the Apostolic Palace on Monday, presenting gifts and discussing their experiences in fighting racism and social injustice. Photos and videos of the meeting showed at least 16 people sitting together in the library and exchanging gifts with no masks and little social-distancing measures. No masks. These NBA players were on an overnight flight from the US just yesterday and met with the pope hours after landing. Beyond bizarre, that Francis prefers these meetings mask-free.https://t.co/UcB9HPSYbs The National Basketball Players Association (NLBPA) said that in accordance with Vatican protocols, members of the delegation underwent Covid-19 testing before the meeting. Pope Francis, who is 83 years old, has been chided for rarely wearing a face covering, even when meeting with people indoors.

"23 Nov, 2020",Putting a George Floyd tribute in a Holocaust memorial center feels like a cultural Kafka trap,"In a time when everyone is looking for dumb takes to slam people over, traps are set to do just that.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC There are many descriptions I can use for opening a George Floyd exhibit within the Holocaust Memorial Resource & EducationCenterin Orlando, none of them good. However, there is a general issue that I find with this scenario beyond any offensiveness. This entire scenario of linking Holocaust to Floyd’s gruesome death comes across like a Kafka trap. For the uninitiated, a Kafka trap is a question that is asked that does not have a good answer. The goal of this trap is for the person asking the question to get the person being questioned to incriminate themselves. It s a very dirty trick. The situation with the Florida Holocaust Center feels like a similar situation. There is an obvious cultural statement that the political left wants to make, and they want anyone who criticizes it to look bad while they do it. “Uprooting Prejudice” At The Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Florida#weavingcommunity#listenfirsthttps://t.co/Frj5ZGcttC The purpose of having a George Floyd tribute inside of a Holocaust museum is to compare what happened to Floyd to the brutality of the Nazi regime. To the sensible person, there can be an agreement that George Floyd did not have to die. However, comparing what happened to him to the horrors of Bergen-Belsen or Auschwitz is beyond absurd. The absurdity is why they do it. Whichever stance you express on this, the trap will be sprung. If you call out the absolute idiocy of this move, the left will smear you as a racist. If you don t, you are complacent in allowing something that makes light of the Holocaust. It’s a dirty trick that is using the dead to try to win political points. In debate or at any other point, the best way to address a Kafka trap is to point out the absurdity of its existence. In this scenario, it is patently absurd to link anything George Floyd-related to the Holocaust – simply because George Floyd’s killing, however despicable, had nothing to do with it! You can mourn his loss without devaluing a part of history that we should never forget. What disturbs me about all of this is the cultural aspect of the decision. We are at a point where people are willing to devalue historic tragedies to gain some sort of political victory against their perceived enemies. This sort of tactic is so pathetic I can t feel anything but sorrow for it. In our modern culture, we re getting way too used to standing on people s graves. Now people are looking at ways to use those that have departed this Earth in tragic manners as a cudgel against their fellow man. Think about it this way. Since George Floyd has died it has been extremely difficult to discuss what actually needs to change to make sure that what happened to him doesn t happen again. The responses have been nothing but extreme, with some trying to focus too much on the character of Floyd and not enough on his rights, and others trying to use him as a reason to abolish police forces. Whenever such things happen, there is an opportunity to look at the scenario and learn from it in a way that can make sure that we progress as a society. Where is the desire to do so? It doesn t exist, and has been replaced with sentiment that parades around the body of George Floyd like a puppet. I think that it s time for a bit of bipartisan sanity. This Kafka trap needs to be called out by both sides because it s absolutely detestable. If we find ourselves unable to do so, learning from the mistakes that humanity makes will become a thing of the past. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/507555-george-floyd-holocaust-museum/
"22 Nov, 2020", I don t know what will happen : Russian football ace says US team AXED him after he chose not to take knee for blacklivesmatter ,"Russian-American footballer Valeri Saramutin has revealed that he was abruptly dropped by US team Austin Bold and is in limbo after failing to take a knee, losing his place in what he believes was a punishment over his decision. Former Russia youth international Saramutin claimed figures at the highest level of the club, which plays in the division below Major League Soccer, first voiced concerns to him when he decided not to join his teammates in taking a knee in the summer. Newcomers Bold had performed the gesture in their first match back after football was suspended during the pandemic, joining the worldwide trend amid widespread social unrest across the US in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police brutality. ""I did not kneel and the club had questions for me,""the 25-year-old midfielder toldSport Express.""The coach said that I need to think about my behavior. From Russia with Love.

""I am fine with what is happening in America but I think, in the summer, this situation began to be exaggerated. Before the matches, everyone would kneel down, [which would be] OK if it was optional."" Saramutin said that club vice-captain Jermaine Taylor, who won 99 caps for Jamaica, had privately offered him support and unsuccessfully ""tried to convince the management"". Bold had asked the squad to take paycuts earlier in the year, and Saramutin speculated that the decision by the majority of players to reject a reduction had begun a ""deterioration of relations"" between the players and the leadership team. ""The whole team was offered to cut their salaries by half, but only five agreed,""he explained.""Older players who had already earned their own money in other clubs.

He missed the only game he could have played in before quarantine through injury and followed the club s training program during lockdown while keeping in touch with his father and sister in New York. He was forced to quarantine for two weeks shortly after the initial issue over the blacklivesmatter protest because a teammate who he lived with tested positive, but his three appearances as a substitute have proved to be his final appearances for the club in his career so far. In the same month as teams performed a protest in which Saramutin said teams had knelt for 46 seconds in the eighth minute of matches – reflecting Floyd s reported eight-minutes-and-46-seconds struggle with police – the midfielder experienced more conflict after he chose not to kneel before a match against Oklahoma. Saramutin alleged that he had watched on as club captain Kleber rowed angrily with bosses in the locker room over being replaced, having also decided not to perform the gesture. Yesterday. Today. Tomorrow. blacklivesmatter #DaleBoldpic.twitter.com/oy3zkG1Wgt ""Kleber was immediately suspended from games and training, although the contract had not yet been broken off – he is in the lineup on the official website,""claimed Saramutin, who said he was the only player to have supported Kleber and had been able to talk to him in Russian because of the Brazilian s five years with Dynamo Kiev. ""I was also suspended after that game, but only from matches. I continued to go to training...[they] talked to me as if nothing had happened. ""No fines were issued – the coach explained to me that I was not physically ready to play.

Saramutin returned to Russia after the USL season ended last month and still has a contract with Bold, although the situation has been further complicated by a lack of clarity over when next season will start. ""I do not know what will happen to me next,""he admitted.""Perhaps they will be more persistent in asking for a salary cut. Perhaps they will offer to break the contract.

Footage from RT’s Ruptly video agency shows total mayhem at the ‘Carrefour’ food store, as protesters ransacked the shop with seeming impunity. Products are seen littering the aisles as alarms are heard ringing in the background. Demonstrators also pelted the store with rocks, shattering its windows, and set a fire inside. The blaze was later extinguished. The unrest was part of nationwide protests sparked by the death of a black man at a Carrefour store in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. The incident occurred on the eve of Black Consciousness Day in Brazil. Footage of the incident shows two security guards restraining and beating the victim, identified as 40-year-old Joao Alberto Silveira Freitas. A store employee reportedly altered the guards, claiming that Freitas threatened to attack her, local media reported. It has not yet been determined what caused Freitas’ death, but some reports have cited preliminary medical analysis pointing to asphyxiation. One of the security guards was reportedly an off-duty policeman. Both suspects have been arrested and are currently being investigated for homicide. The supermarket chain said on Friday that it had ended its contract with the security firm whose employees were allegedly involved in the killing. The video also shows one of the guards kneeling on Freitas back, drawing comparisons to the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police in May.

"15 Nov, 2020","Escape from New York: 300,000 households flee as lockdowns & surging crime sour residents","Roughly 300,000 households have moved out of New York City since March, fleeing a metropolis that has become a land of lockdowns and rising violent crime in a year dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and civil unrest. US Postal Servicedataobtained by the New York Post showed that there were more than 295,000 change-of-address requests filed by residents moving out of the city s five boroughs from March 1 through October 31. The data included only moves to counties with 11 or more forwarding requests filed, meaning relocations to places where 10 or fewer New Yorkers moved during the period weren t counted. Each change-of-address request typically covers a whole household, not just an individual, so the number of people moving would be higher than the number of filings. There were nearly 245,000 moving notices filed with the Postal Service in March-July alone, the Post said, up from 101,000 a year earlier. The exodus has been blamed on Covid-19 concerns, economic woes, rising crime and troubled schools. New York state has suffered more than 33,000 Covid-19 deaths, the most in the nation, and more than 24,000 were in New York City. The city has had some of the most stringent economic lockdowns in the country to deter the spread of the virus, leading to thousands of restaurants, shops and other firms going out of business. New York is also among many large US cities that have been rocked by blacklivesmatter protests and violent Antifa riots and looting in the aftermath of George Floyd s death in Minneapolis police custody in May. A Manhattan Institutepolltaken from July 13 to August 3 showed that 44 percent of New Yorkers who make more than $100,000 annually had considered moving out of the city since March. Nearly two-thirds said they believed present conditions were a “new normal” for the city. Respondents said their quality of life had deteriorated, and their satisfaction with the city dropped by half. The law of supply and demand also illustrates the growing desire to get out of New York City. To rent a 20-foot U-Haul truck on December 4 to move from New York to Nashville, Tennessee, would cost $2,153,accordingto the company s website. To make the same move in reverse on the same date, the truck rental would cost $677, or less than one-third the rate to leave New York. As for violent crime, there were 344murdersin New York from January through September, exceeding the total of 335 for all of 2019 with three months still remaining to go in 2020. The number of shootings has risen 94 percent. The Post said most of the forwarding addresses are in nearby locales, such as New Jersey and neighboring New York counties. But more than 13,000 households moved to three counties in Florida, and nearly 9,000 redirected their mail to Los Angeles. Governor Andrew Cuomo s efforts to urge wealthy New Yorkers tomove backto the city apparently have had little effect. More than 16,000 Manhattan apartments sat vacant as of October, the most in 14 years. Cuomo announced new Covid-19 restrictions on Wednesday, prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people in homes and requiring restaurants and bars to close by 10pm.

Their exhibition, We Protect You From Yourselves, is currently at Biennale Warsaw, presented bya/political. 2020 has been a year of ever increasing state-sanctioned violence. In the UK the new Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill, currently being rushed through parliament, willallowundercover agents to commit ‘murder, torture and rape’ in the name of queen and country. From Madrid to London and Warsaw, our work asks what freedoms are stolen in the name of government control. Under the pretext of public safety, in late 2014 the Spanish parliament passed the Basic Law for the Protection of PublicSecurity. Despite strong opposition and condemnation, this new legislation revoked civil liberties including the right to peaceful assembly. As a direct consequence of these laws, we were prosecuted for 18 Portraits, a series of photographs of riot-police during the anti-austerity Rodea el Congreso rally in September 2012 in Madrid. We were handed a fine of €600,000 and risked three years in prison. The case was the first of its kind to target individuals rather than corporations, in a bid to intimidate and terrorize, and restrict acts of creative freedom classed as antagonistic to the official line. The case dragged on while we anticipated bankruptcy and imprisonment. It finally ended only when we proved our motives were artistic and not criminal. We walked away as supposedly free citizens, though we can still be prosecuted if we exhibit these works again in Spain, and the law remains in place. It is the same type of legislation that will be presented at the Assemblée Nationale in France next week, whereby anyone could be imprisoned for a year or face €45,000 fine for“disseminating by any means or medium whatsoever, with the aim or harming their physical or psychological integrity, the image of the face or any other identifying element of an officer of the national police or member of the national gendarmerie when engaged in a police operation”. Not only does this have extraordinary implications for journalists, the accountability we see as a result of photographs and videos taken by civilians on their mobiles of police misconduct will all but disappear. We Protect You From Yourselvesis a series of works we produced using the image and voices of the police to present their contradictory role in society both as protectors and aggressors. We are currently exhibiting the series at the Biennale Warszawa in Poland against a backdrop of right-wing marches and anti-abortion protests. But the escalating abuse of power by the ‘guardians of civil liberties’ can be seen throughout the world. Only this year the world watched a video of a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd for eight minutes and forty seven seconds, killing him. We’ve seen security forces indiscriminately attacking protestors, journalists and medics at the ensuing blacklivesmatter demonstrations. And protesters being kidnapped from the street by masked men in Belarus and Nigeria’s SARS squad torturing and killing the opposition. Our art is putting the police back in the frame – making them visible and accountable for their actions. The mechanisms of power are manifest both in plain sight and purposely obscured in an effort to maintain control. Our exhibition asks what should be done to counteract this force. In Houston, Texas, we collaborated with the Huey P Newton Gun Club for an ‘open carry’ demonstration on the streets. They were armed, engaged and vocalising the names of comrades who have died at the hands of the police. These individuals embody the resistance – prepared to defend their liberties with the same strategies the police use to ‘protect’ us. While the portraits of the Huey P Newton Gun club members were consensual and those of the police were not, we present both with the same objectivity that questions who really should be in control of our ownprotection. Some civilians who fight for our rights are brave enough to show their faces. Unfortunately, those who are hired to maintain social order by the state are protected by a power that is as insidious as it is obscure.

"14 Nov, 2020",F(und) the police: Minneapolis allocates $500k to hire cops from other departments amid officer shortage,"Minneapolis, ground zero for the continuing BLM protests, has approved a plan to add more law enforcement personnel to the city’s police department for the remainder of 2020, allocating nearly $500,000 to the force. The decision was narrowly passed by the Minneapolis City Council in a 7-6 vote on Friday. The city has allocated $496,800 to bring 20 to 40 additional officers from Hennepin County Sheriff s Office and Metro Transit, who will be helping the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) from November 15 till the end of the year. The idea to bring in reinforcements was floated by the city’s police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who revealed that nearly 500 people have been wounded by gunfire so far this year throughout the city. “Our resources are hemorrhaging,”Arradondo told the city council on Tuesday. Our city is bleeding at this moment. I m trying to do all I can to stop that bleeding and I m hoping that, having the funds to launch a citywide joint enforcement team initiative, we can try to stop the bleeding in our city. The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, admitted that the police force has faced a mass exodus of officers, with retirement rates growing more than twofold this year. “On an annual basis we see somewhere in the range of 40 to 45 officers retire or resign,”Frey said.“Now, those numbers are well beyond 100. And it does have an impact.” Apart from that, some 100 more officers are on paid leave and are not actually partaking in active duty, according to the city’s officials. On top of the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, the city has also faced an“intolerable level of gun violence and crime,”the mayor stated. The city has experienced a spike in homicides, with some 75 people killed so far this year. Other violent crime, such as robberies and carjacking, is on the rise as well, with more than 4,600 incidents registered – a five-year high. Minneapolis has become ground zero for the blacklivesmatter protests that have been gripping the US for several months. In many cities across the country, the protests have repeatedly spiraled into rioting, with violence, arson, and widespread looting. The protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old man who perished at the hands of Minneapolis police during a brutal arrest late in May. The incident has reinvigorated the drive against police brutality, resulting in bans on the use of riot control equipment in several cities. It also sparked the“defund the police”movement, proponents of which believe law enforcement departments should be stripped of a large chunk of their budgets, which should then be re-allocated to“community”projects.

"13 Nov, 2020","Bristol statue destruction is ‘CULTURAL EVENT OF THE YEAR’? We are in big trouble, Twitter critics say","The UK media has found a cultural outlet to be praised as a masterpiece – destroying statues. While some agree that defacing a monument in Bristol was the best art expression of the year, others say vandalism is not an option. “Throwing Edward Colston’s statue in the Avon was the cultural event of the year,”art critic Mark Hudson wrote in the Independent on Thursday. Hudson argued that in a year where Britain’s first lockdown closed galleries and theaters and forced audiences to view art and listen to music from their smartphone screens, the toppling of Colston’s statue was a live event, towering above any“internet-based art projects.” Edward Colston was a 17th Century philanthropist and merchant who funded hospitals and schools in his native Bristol. He was also a slave trader, and as ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests went worldwide this summer after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, protesters in Bristol tore his likeness off its plinth and rolled it into the River Avon. Commenters online were outraged at Hudson’s apparent praise for the statue-topplers in Bristol.“If this was a cultural event,”onewrote,“we are in big trouble, culturally.” It was Unforgivable Cultural Vandalism.https://t.co/4XTwj30U9b Barbarians have breached the gates.https://t.co/VVnGRSLvqT Not everyone endorsed a cultural non-profit organization’stweetcomparing the Colston statue case to the atrocities committed by ISIS against Palmyra monuments or by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Still, even those who support the removal of ‘problematic’ statues considered vandalism a step too far. I care not a whit about colston s statue but disapprove of the method. To compare it to the destruction at Palmyra or Bamiyan is just ridiculous ‘Save Our Statues’ activists are not alone in their criticism, though. When Colston’s statue was pulled down, British politician Nigel Farage controversiallycomparedthe blacklivesmatter movement’s actions to the Taliban’s destruction of two-centuries-old statues of Buddha in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, those endorsing Hudson’s point of view say statues should come down amid the fight against injustice – and actually, Colston deserved to have his monument demolished. Toppling icons of slavery and supremacism really triggers racists. It was a good thing. I lived in a neighbouring county & worked in Bristol for over 15 years. Colston s statue was an insult to the city s BAME population. Bristol is a diverse city which has had a multicultural population for over 200 yrs. Colston s statue glorified a murderer. Colston was not the only divisive figure targeted by blacklivesmatter this summer. One day before Colston’s statue came down, protesters in Londondefaceda monument to Winston Churchill, and vandalized – for a questionable reason – a statue of Abraham Lincoln, the US president responsible for abolishing slavery. Throughout the UK, protesters called the statues and monuments of colonialist Cecil Rhodes and biologist Charles Darwin to be slated for removal. London Mayor Sadiq Khan set up acommissionin June to pore over the capital’s statues, buildings and street names to remove those that“reflect a bygone era.” None of these moves were praised as art the way Colston’s removal was. Shortly after the Colston statue’s destruction, activists installed a resin figure of a black woman with a raised fist, which wasremovedby council officials a day later. The woman who inspired the replacement statue, Jen Reid, has been treated to a profile by local news outlet Bristol Live. The news site described the destruction of Colston’s statue as“a momentous day which shook the world,”and Reid added that she“would do it all over again.” Winston Churchill, now a target for the woke mob, would likely have taken a dim view of Reid and the statue-destroyers targeting the UK’s history.“To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years,”he once remarked.“To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.” ",https://www.rt.com/uk/506652-colston-statue-cultural-event/
"13 Nov, 2020",Quality vs quota? Outcry as Mayor Sadiq Khan tells London police that 40% of new hires must be BAME,"London’s top cop has been told that 40 percent of new recruits must be from ethnic minority backgrounds as the city’s government looks to tackle allegations of racism and discrimination. The UK’s biggest police force has accepted plans to introduce a minimum quota for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) recruits. It is anticipated that Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, will unveil the new race action plan on Friday. The move is the result of long negotiations between the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Met police. Khantweeted:“There remains a great deal of work to do to unpick the conscious and unconscious bias and systemic racism that still exists in our public institutions and our society as a whole. Our Action Plan will introduce the biggest policing reforms seen in a generation.” London s police are the best in the world, but we must do more to improve Black Londoners trust and confidence in our police service, and ensure police powers don’t disproportionately impact them. That s why@MetPoliceUKand I are taking action: 1/2pic.twitter.com/9h5XIqwmjJ London’s police force has the most BAME officers in the UK but still underrepresents the vast ethnic minority community in the British capital. Currently, 40 percent of London’s population is BAME, while only 15.4 percent of the Met’s officers are of BAME backgrounds. In 2019, the Met’s head of human resources, Clare Davies, told reporters that“it would take over 100 years to be representative of London.” While some people showed their support for the race action plan, the initiative has been condemned on Twitter.Some slammed Khan’s scheme, with one user questioning whether it is a ‘form of racism’ itself and whether there could be a positive outcome. Isn t this a form of racism itself? Affirmative action of some sorts? Don t need to look further than South Africa to see the outcome of that...@SadiqKhan@BorisJohnson Another user was disappointed not to see employment offered on the basis on merit. Not those with the right skills then. Just the right ethnicity. Something wrong with the met. Some lamented the initiative, claiming that diversity always comes down to quotas and saying“Quality doesn t matter.” Quality doesn’t matter. In the end diversity is all about quotas.https://t.co/MmoXs5OLDw Many were keen to point out that more than 87% of the UK population is white despite a high BAME population in the capital and notably its Eastern districts. Despite the country being approx 80% white?#positivediscriminationhttps://t.co/XDZG9UbyDv Meanwhile, some praised the initiative. Labour Councilor Judith Garfield claimed that other cities should take note. @SadiqKhan’s Action Plan will improve trust in policing and ultimately help to keep Londoners safe.This level of investment in training and community engagement is unmatched - other cities should take notehttps://t.co/xQTJTuem3q Previous attempts to introduce more diversity on the frontline of London’s police force have failed. The Met police saw a considerable drop in the number of BAME candidates applying to join the force and passing its competency-based questionnaire during its 2013 recruitment campaign. The Met police have come under pressure in 2020, a year of protracted civil rights campaigning and mass blacklivesmatter protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of US cops in May. Protests were organized in at least 260 locations around Britain. A number of monuments linked to the UK’s colonial past were also targeted by the BLM protesters, and in some places, clashes broke out between protesters and right-wing groups who claimed they wanted to protect the statues. A study by the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), a group that monitors public order policing, identified“excessive use of force and the disproportionate targeting of black protesters,”during BLM demonstrations in May and June. London’s police force has frequently been the target of protests and campaigns, with demonstrators accusing officers of racial profiling. Reports show that black people are six times more likely than white people to be stopped by police when driving. ",https://www.rt.com/uk/506606-police-london-bame-blm-racism/
"12 Nov, 2020",British police ‘ignored and even criminalized’ injured BLM protestors with ‘institutionally racist’ tactics — report,"The policing of the UK’s blacklivesmatter (BLM) protests this summer was “institutionally racist” and officers used “excessive force”, according to a group that monitors public order policing. A study by the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol)publishedon Thursday identified“excessive use of force and the disproportionate targeting of black protesters,”during BLM demonstrations in May and June. Protests were organized in at least 260 places around Britain in the wake of the killing of George Floyd who died in police custody in the US state of Minnesota on May 25. Disturbing footage of his arrest showed an officer kneeling on his neck, despite Floyd saying he could not breathe. A number of monuments linked to the UK s colonial past were targeted by the BLM protesters, and in some places, clashes broke out between protesters and right-wing groups who claimed they wanted to protect the statues. The 56-page report, ‘Britain is Not Innocent’, drew on evidence from over 100 witnesses, including protesters and legal observers about how police handled the marches, the group said. Among the report’s other key areas of concern is“kettling,”a police tactic where a large number of protestors are enclosed by officers. Thepublicationclaimed that under-18s and vulnerable people were confined in this manner without food and water, with no social distancing or access to toilets.Also highlighted are“far right”counter-protestors who, the report claims, launched“racist attacks”on young people. These targeted young people were then“ignored and even criminalized by police.” “There is a bitter irony in the fact that protests against racism in policing were themselves sites of disproportionate use of force and discriminatory practices,”said the author of the report, Dr Adam Elliott-Cooper. “Policing in Britain still has a serious problem with institutional racism,” ",https://www.rt.com/uk/506517-uk-blm-protests-police-racist-report/
"12 Nov, 2020",Silencing ‘defund the police’ campaigners is the next big battle in the Democrats’ civil war,"Old-guard Democrats Joe Manchin and Jim Clyburn have made clear how opposed they are to defunding the police.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC Defunding the police has been one of the key battlecries from Democratic lawmakers ever since the death of George Floyd. But with the Republicans gaining so much ground in the House of Representatives in the wake of this push, Democrats are beginning to speak out against the movement. To the surprise of very few, it’s far from popular with voters to diminish what they see is the first line of defense against criminality in their communities. What’s not been so widely anticipated is that the Democrats are starting to see a divide within their leadership over this particular subject. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn have both expressed their distaste for the idea. Clyburn flat out stated in aninterviewwith Axios that the messaging hurt them in the election. He said, “Sloganeering kills people. Sloganeering destroys movements. Stop sloganeering. And let s go about the business of representing people and building hopes and aspirations for people.” And more specifically, he reflected, “That phrase — defund the police — cost Jaime Harrison tremendously,” referring to the Democratic Senate candidate who failed to take Republican Lindsey Graham’s seat in South Carolina. Joe Manchin’s reply to the idea of defunding the police was “defund, my butt. We are the party of working men and women. We want to protect Americans jobs & healthcare. We do not have some crazy socialist agenda, and we do not believe in defunding the police.” I don’t know if we needed to hear about Senator Manchin’s rear, but the message is pretty clear. Defund the police? Defund, my butt. I m a proud West Virginia Democrat. We are the party of working men and women. We want to protect Americans jobs & healthcare. We do not have some crazy socialist agenda, and we do not believe in defunding the police.https://t.co/EIFHX5OQ37 Now, this flies in the face of more progressive candidates such as congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who hasconsistentlypushed the ‘defund the police’ mantra. There s an obvious divide here. It seems glaringly obvious that the old guard of the Democrat party is at odds with the new, progressive wing that it has welcomed in. A cynic might say that this form of extreme messaging is considered permissible by Democrats as long as there is a chance it may help attract votes from certain communities. However, when the rubber meets the road, progressive policies like this just aren’t popular. As such, old guard Democrats who don’t want to lose ground in government are more than happy to dump the messaging as quickly as they can. As I discussed when I wrote about California Senator Dianne Feinstein playing nice during Amy Coney Barrett s Supreme Courtconfirmation, the old guard of the Democrat Party know how to play politics. They are fully aware of what needs to be done and has to be said to stay in power. The much more progressive younger generation seem to be idealists. They tend to buy into messaging that you will see from groups such asThe Young Turks, which has little practical use in politics. And frankly, the old guard is not going to risk alienating the electorate just because a bunch of young people who like Karl Marx a bit too much scream slogans that don’t solve anything. This is ultimately where we see the generations split. When the likes of Joe Manchin or Jim Clyburn first got into politics, the Democrats were the working man’s party. Blue collar practicality is what got them into office. These days, many younger, idealistic Democrats sit way further to the left. Their pie-in-the-sky worldview is clearly going to clash with anyone who doesn t have their head in the clouds. And that’s why an idea like defunding police doesn’t sit well with many potential Democrat voters. To put it simply, defunding the police is one of the most bone-headed political moves of the past two decades. So, while ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ messaging will remain perfectly fine to older Democrats, don’t expect them to back any sort of policy to defund police that will lose them the House of Representatives in 2022.

"12 Nov, 2020","As Florida plans green light for store owners to shoot looters, gunfights at high noon may become the new American reality","With tensions soaring amid a spate of police incidents involving African Americans, the state of Florida is considering allowing business owners to shoot looters on site. Is this the law the US needs to end mob violence? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Happily, America’s Sunshine State has largely escaped the wanton violence and destruction that has greeted others amid a nationwide wave of protests over police brutality. But Governor Ron DeSantis doesn’t seem to be taking any chances, empowering the average citizen to behave like the local sheriff. What could possibly go wrong? The Republican leaderdraftedtough ‘anti-mob’ legislation that would give Florida business owners the right to use force against looters participating in“violent or disorderly assemblies.”The proposal highlights the deep chasm that now separates Republicans and Democrats over the question of personal security and gun rights at a time when plans to defund police departments are on the drawing board. Florida Gov. DeSantis’ anti-mob law moves to allow citizens to shoot lootershttps://t.co/snb9IhkOGkpic.twitter.com/VbRXqWaH3B The nation got a shock in May after George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, died under the knee of a white cop during an attempted arrest. The ensuing outbreak of arson, vandalism and looting across the country cost anestimated$1-2 billion, representing the most expensive price tag from civil strife in US history. Meanwhile, many looted and torched small businesses, already on the verge of bankruptcy due to an economic lockdown from Covid-19, were forever consigned to the graveyard. To put a face on the tragedy, consider thestoryof Linda Carpenter and her son Scott who fought back tears as they surveyed the charred remains of B & L Office Furniture, a family business they had spent the last 40 years building. In late August, their store in Kenosha, Wisconsin was one of many looted and burned down after local police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old African-American who reportedly resisted arrest. The Carpenters were not guilty of any crime, yet overnight a lifetime of work and dedication to their business was senselessly destroyed. Although many businesses have ‘mob insurance’ to cover any damages sustained by looting, theft and vandalism, these same businesses typically do not qualify for coverage from a pandemic. Thus, being forced to rebuild a business in a climate of tremendous economic uncertainty will seem like mission impossible for many. Thus, it may actually come down to a question of sheer survival – keeping food on the table for a family – to protect one’s business from literal destruction. So. If I’m reading this correctly, under DeSantis anti-mob legislation, when conservatives block a Planned Parenthood Clinic, the blockers can legally just be gunned down in Florida. I really don’t think they have thought this one through. 🙄 Not so long ago, Americans could rest assured that the police would protect them and their businesses in times of crisis. Today, no American can take their personal security for granted, and themassive spikein gun sales in the last year is a reflection of that uncertainty. Gun-loving Republicans have been watching in alarm as liberal-run cities and states enact measures that hamper the police from doing their jobs, at the very same time their neighborhoods are going up in flames. In September, for example, Portland Mayor Ted Wheelerorderedlocal police to stop using tear gas at protesters during demonstrations. The order came after the city had experienced 105 straight days of protest, many of them violent in nature. Oregon State Police called Wheeler’s decision“reckless and short sighted,”and threatened to stop sending troopers to help Portland cops deal with the demonstrations. At the same time, liberals are displaying camaraderie with the looters and vandals, as witnessed byHollywood celebritieswho happily post the criminals’ bail and return them to the streets. One blacklivesmatter organizercomparedlooting that broke out in Chicago to“reparations”that are“owed”to black people as payment for the slavery years. But perhaps the last straw for Republicans came whenMark and Patricia McCloskeyresponded to protesters trespassing on their property in an upscale St. Louis neighborhood by brandishing firearms. In a decision that infuriated conservatives, the local court charged the McCloskeys with a felony count for the“unlawful use of a weapon.” Clearly, a precedent is being set, at least in the Democrat-run states, that the average citizen has almost no rights when it comes to protecting himself from criminals. That is not the best message to be sending, especially when these same Democrat states are having serious discussions about defunding and even demobilizing their police departments. And as Joe Biden looks set to be the next president, with Kamala Harris and the progressives in the shadows, these lawless tendencies promise to continue. Sen. Kamala Harris says if she is elected President, she will give Congress 100 days ""to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action""https://t.co/KFdn5Viqm1#HarrisTownHallpic.twitter.com/Ds8DxObhAY At first glance, Florida’s proposal to let business owners resort to deadly force against would-be looters and arsonists seems a bit over-the-top. After all, is it justifiable for any person to lose their life for the crime of stealing a widescreen TV or a pair of sneakers? Governor DeSantis is probably hoping that his legislation will work more as a deterrent to crime than creating dangerous conditions for his people. In other words, if members of the mob understand that business owners are within their legal rights to protect their premises with a gun, then they may think twice before carrying out their illicit activities. No! That’s why we have police. I hate to think I would kill someone over a can of beans. Looting a store is different than robbing a house. Also would they have to be armed? The ideal solution, of course, would be for the police to handle such situations as they arise. However, given that these servants of the public are rarely on the scene of a crime when it happens (otherwise it probably wouldn’t happen in the first place), who better to protect a business from theft and destruction than the owner himself? So long as the owner is a responsible gun owner, his or her mere presence may go far toward deterring crime. It is even possible to imagine a ‘confederation’ of armed store owners working together to protect their businesses in times of crisis – something like an armed version of the ‘Guardian Angels’ – that would serve as a powerful message to any would-be criminals looking for some vulnerable store to loot and torch. It also does not require much imagination, however, for that scenario to end in disaster as one side begins to seek retribution for the death or injury of one of its own. A bit like mafia groups, nobody would want to leave their home without being armed to the teeth and in a group. In other words, the conditions would be set for the US to return to a ‘Wild West’ scenario where people openly carried firearms and resolved issues by whoever had the ‘fastest draw’. Probably not the most comforting image for a modern democracy, but it is getting difficult to imagine any other. In the final analysis, it looks as though the liberals have swung too hard left, alienating entire police departments for the crimes of a few. At the same time, the Republicans seem to be overcorrecting the situation, enabling business owners to behave as judge, jury and executioner for petty theft. Neither one of these solutions sounds favorable; best for the American people to place their trust in their police, the majority of whom have the best intentions at heart, while making sure these servants of the people are properly trained to handle any and all situations that may occur on the job. Otherwise, America is truly heading back to the future of the Wild West. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/506481-florida-law-shoot-looters/
"12 Nov, 2020",License to shoot rioters & looters? Florida governor proposes expanding ‘stand your ground’ law,"Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has reportedly put forth a bill that would justify use of force against rioters and looters, block their release on bail, and punish local authorities who seek to defund the police. While no official proposal has been filed, the Miami Herald reported on the bill’s existence, citing documents obtained through a public records request. Under the reported proposal, Florida’s existing“stand your ground”doctrine justifying the use of force in self-defense would be expanded to people engaging in rioting –“interruption or impairment”of a business – and looting, defined as a burglary within 500 feet of a“violent or disorderly assembly.” DeSantis Pushes To Expand Stand Your Ground Law To Allow Citizens To Defend Against Rioters, Lootershttps://t.co/MaYQRmEiGu Other measures in the draft would see harsher penalties for those convicted of looting or rioting, including those who block traffic – while offering immunity to motorists who unintentionally injure or kill protesters who get in their way. Anyone convicted of participating in“violent or disorderly”assemblies would be ineligible for assistance benefits, while any government employees who take part would be fired. No one charged in relation to riots would be allowed bail before facing a judge. DeSantis also wants municipalities to certify they are not“disproportionately”cutting law enforcement funding, and prove that any cuts are due to a reduction in revenue. If any of these things sound familiar, that’s because defunding the police has been a key demand of blacklivesmatter protesters over the summer, while Democrat prosecutors – often elected with the help of George Soros’s deep pockets – have moved to abolish bail and release people arrested for looting and rioting, while prosecuting motorists and citizens who defended themselves. Not surprisingly, Democrats are up in arms about the proposal. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said DeSantis is trying to be a contestant in the“Trump beauty pageant”in which Republican officials are competing to see who would follow in the current president’s footsteps. “It dangerously gives armed private citizens power to kill as they subjectively determine what constitutes ‘criminal mischief’ that interferes with a business,”Aubrey Webb, former prosecutor in the Democrat stronghold of Miami-Dade, told the Herald.“Someone graffiti-ing ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ on a wall? Urinating behind a dumpster? Blocking an entrance?” The bill would encourage vigilantes to administer “cruel and unusual punishment” for property crimes, argued his colleague Denise Georges. “We cannot live in a lawless society where taking a life is done so casually and recklessly.” DeSantis’s proposal appears to be a response to the riots that broke out across the US in May, following the death of George Floyd, an African-American man, in police custody in Minnesota. Arson and looting across the country has resulted in at least 20 deaths and more than $2 billion in property damages in just the first several weeks, according to conservative estimates. The judiciary committees of the Florida Senate and the state House have both received a draft of the bill, the Herald reported. So far, no lawmaker has publicly said they would sponsor DeSantis’s proposal. Committees begin their meetings in January, and the legislatures will start their 2021 sessions in March.

"7 Nov, 2020", You re fired : Gleeful LeBron James among those to gloat as Biden declares victory over Trump,"NBA icon LeBron James couldn t restrain his delight after it was reported on Saturday that Democratic nominee Joe Biden had surpassed the 270 electoral college votes required to send Donald Trump packing from the White House. As soon as Biden s win in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania was reported by the AP and other outlets, handing the former Vice President the state s 20 electoral votes he needed to bring an end to the Trump presidency, social media predictably erupted after a contentious campaign which had stoked divisions across the country. The impact of the campaign was deeply felt in sports. The blacklivesmatter protests earlier this year intersected both politics and sport, as several big name athletes threw their support behind the movement and, by proxy, Biden. The racial debate which followed the death of George Floyd in May was felt particularly hard in the NBA - a sports league where more than 80 percent of its players are African-American. Several players orchestrated their own campaigns to help motivate voters, with several NBA teams even offering their facilities as venues to host voting drives, and even acting as polling centers. And now, with the outcome of the US presidential election seemingly all wrapped up, Los Angeles Lakers star James was quick in celebrating Biden s win. 😉@morethanavote👑pic.twitter.com/n6kmG12H1X 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾https://t.co/2FwRpCKsnB James first tweet, an image of him smoking a cigar, could clearly be interpreted as him celebrating Biden s win - while a second retweet of a video clip of Trump saying You re Fired also left little doubt as to his political persuasion. The NBA star was joined by several other notable names from the sporting community in reacting to the results - but one notable UFC star, vocal Trump supporter Jorge Masvidal, says that he is waiting for the reigning president to step in and correct the record. Joe Biden is projected as the next US President. However VAR are reviewing it. Joe told Trump well Bi-Den 😭😭 The media state has declared Joe Biden the President.

"7 Nov, 2020",‘Antifa interning : Twitter users ask who’s posting on behalf of Oregon police after joke about Trump arrest,"Oregon State Police’s Twitter account has been bombarded with a slew of irritated comments, after it joked about the arrest of a man named Tyler Trump. The 35-year-old man, who happens to share a last name with the incumbent US president, was busted early on Friday morning while trying to break into a bar and grill in the town of Fairview, Oregon, Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office has reported. After a short chase, canine officer Pardo“followed his nose right to the suspect,”resulting in an arrest. The otherwise routine report resulted in unusually high engagement on social media, as people praised the work of the K9-unit agent, with many responding, “Good boy, Pardo!” Oregon State Police no doubt simply wanted to get a look-in on the positive publicity by sharing the tweet, joking that it had nothing to do with the ongoing election and posting a wink emoji. Promise this is unrelated to the elections 😉, just a total coincidence 🤷🏻‍♀️https://t.co/tu565bHcYk But unlike the positive reaction to the initial tweet by the Multnomah County Sheriff’s office, the follow-up attempt at political humor apparently angered and upset many Twitter users. One commenter even suggested an Antifa member must be at the helm of the police’s social media accounts. Unbecoming to the line of duty. Antifa interning in communications dept at OSP Somecomparedthe stunt to a recent PR fiasco in Oregon’s Washington County. Last week, after an onslaught of negative comments, the sheriff’s office there deleted a Halloween tweet showing a pair of troopers dressed respectively as “Sheriff Vader” and a stormtrooper. Donning the costumes of the iconic Star Wars villain and a foot soldier of the oppressive empire was deemed inappropriate by many social media users, who accused police in Oregon of real-life brutality and the suppression of peaceful protests. pic.twitter.com/2nGoLhd16E Interestingly, some on the left side of the political spectrum saw the post as offensive too. One woman said it would be better if Oregon State Police quit their jobs instead of“trying to be charming”to win people over “while at the same time attacking” them. Did you really just use a winky emoji? The energy you spend trying to be charming and win over the community while at the same time attacking them would probably be better spent by, I don t know, quitting your jobs. Oregon has seen some of the US’ most intense confrontations between blacklivesmatter protesters and law enforcement agents. Central Portland, which is in Multnomah County, witnessed a string of nearly nightly riots over several months, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. Political tensions escalated further after last week’s presidential election, which failed to result in a clear-cut victory for either President Donald Trump or ex-Vice President Joe Biden. The outcome hangs on results in a handful of battleground states, which tipped in Biden’s favor after mail-in ballots were counted. Trump claimed this to be the result of a fraud. Despite the fury over the Oregon police joke, it seems there was no dispute about K9 Pardo being one cute officer. Politics aside cute dog If you like this story, share it with a friend!

His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo Liberals love to denounce Trump as a devout racist, but his victory in the Sunshine State (and maybe re-election) thanks to Latino and black voters, is a gloriously resounding rebuke to racial and ethnic identity politics. The woke reaction to this stunning admonishment has been to let their diversity loving masks fall and reveal their true racist nature by questioning the bona fides of certain Latinos and chastising them for thinking on their own. For instance, Nikole Hannah-Jones, the New York Times editor who created the controversial Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project, tweeted after Trump won Florida that she was going to“write a piece about how Latino is a contrived ethnic category that lumps white Cubans with Black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans and helps explains why Latinos support Trump at the second highest rate.” One day after this election is over I am going to write a piece about how Latino is a contrived ethnic category that artificially lumps white Cubans with Black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans and helps explains why Latinos support Trump at the second highest rate. This was followed by a tweet from commentator Jemele Hill that stated,“If Trump wins re-election, it’s on white people. No one else.” If Trump wins re-election, it’s on white people. No one else. According to Hannah-Jones and Hill, we don’t need to follow Dr. Martin Luther King’s desire to judge people by the content of their character, instead we must only judge people by the color of their skin and their mindless dedication to the woke cause. What Jones and Hill are really doing here is putting a twist on Joe Biden’s memorably paternalistic claim to black voters during the campaign that if they consider voting for Trump,“they ain’t black!” For Jones and Hill, if Latinos vote for Trump, they must be those evil“white Latinos,”while the ‘real’ Latinos, like the black Puerto Ricans and Indigenous Guatemalans, think the same way she does. Of course, she has no idea what the breakdown of the Latino vote is, but she is incapable of seeing things through any other filter than black versus white. One can’t help but wonder what vitriol Jones and Hill privately spew towards the black voters who voted for Trump in Florida and substantially boosted his chances of victory. I assume they think they really“ain’t black,”and if they are black then they must be self-loathing Uncle Toms or some other repulsive slur. What Trump’s solid showing with Hispanics and blacks in Florida really shows is that the vapid woke pandering on race and ethnicity resonates more with comfortable suburban white voters who want to signal their phony virtue than it does with actual minorities. It is like the demand from blacklivesmatter in the wake of the George Floyd death for cities to ‘Defund the Police’. That plays well in suburbs where crime isn’t an issue, but in poor, crime infested, inner-city neighborhoods, that message is not going to go over so well. Another example is Latino voters, many of whom are either immigrants or direct descendants of immigrants. They didn’t come to America thinking it was the racist hellhole that Hannah-Jones and her 1619 Project make it out to be. They see America as a glorious opportunity to better themselves and their children. These Latinos don’t watch the blacklivesmatter riots over the summer and sympathize with the looters, they empathize with the store owners who were having their life’s work destroyed. The same disconnect is true regarding the incessant claim to victimhood by the proponents of wokeness. Social Justice Warriors demand that minorities embrace victimhood, but you know what? Most people don’t want to be victims, don’t want to be told what to think and don’t want to be seen as avatars for some soulless identity group, but rather as individuals. This is not a black, white, Latino or Asian thing… this is a human thing. Human beings, no matter their race, ethnicity or any other identifying trait, are all unique and want to be seen and treated accordingly. One would hope that this slap in the face to Social Justice Warriors and the woke brigade would snap them out of the spell of identity politics. But I doubt that happens. The woke will never take responsibility for their failure. There will be no introspection, no self-evaluation and re-configuration. There will only be more blame. In fact, I am sure these Latinos who voted for Trump will no doubt become the villains of 2020, replacing Russians from the 2016 election. In conclusion, Trump’s minority support in Florida speaks volumes about the amazing power of the melting pot of America, and the vicious, venal and vacuous nature of those who live and die by the woke sword of identity politics.

"3 Nov, 2020","‘Connotations of colonialism’? Grammys ditch ‘world music’ category, for less ‘problematic’ name","The Grammys are getting rid of their “best world music” album category, replacing it with “best global music”, all in bid to depart from “connotations of colonialism”. The Recording Academy announced the decision toBillboardmagazine on Monday, saying that the award show will be“updating its language”to better“engage and celebrate the current scope of music from around the world”. According to the academy, the ‘world’ term had such“connotations”as“colonialism, folk, and ‘non-American’.” The decision to switch from it follows the organization’s discussions with artists, ethnomusicologists and linguists“from around the world,”as the academy somewhat ironically put it. Originally introduced in 1991, the ‘world music’ category was meant to broadly encompass various international recordings with no deference to their genres, united only by not being rooted in either Western or Latin traditions, already established in the American media. For quite a long time the term has beencriticizedas“problematic”and sometimes even“racist,”with music industry members arguing, that it was too gross a generalization of many peoples’ cultures. The academy’s move seems to be following a much wider media trend of organizations trying to appease culture critics. The Oscars last year rebranded its Best Foreign Language Film award category as Best International Feature Film. Issues of racism and colonialism have become especially hot topics recently, amplified by the wave of the blacklivesmatter protests, which were sparked by George Floyd’s death in late May. Although the Grammys are yet to update their rule book with a new description of the rebranded“global music”category, the move has left many industry critics wondering whether the change in the name would make any difference.“It s the category itself that has connotations of colonialism, not just what they call it,”one of the commenterssaid, while otherscriticizedthe academy for“self-back patting”over the name change which they believe is pathetic.

Police in riot gear moved in to disperse the mob. Vancouver, Washington, located about 12 miles north of Portland, resembled a war zone on Friday night as protesters blocked traffic and vandalized buildings. The unrest began with a vigil for a black man, identified by family as Kevin Peterson, who’d been shot and killed by local police during a pursuit in which he’d allegedly pulled a gun. But after the peaceful memorial service, several hundred protesters rampaged through downtown Vancouver. Videos posted to social media show mayhem in Washington city.

"29 Oct, 2020", Isn’t it their own right? : Krasnodar players become presumed racists for not taking a knee before game vs Chelsea,"Players from Russian team Krasnodar have predictably faced accusations of racism online after some of them did not take a knee before their 4-0 defeat to Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. Chelsea’s players all took a knee ahead of the game in Russia while four Krasnodar players did the same, but some fans hit out at broadcasters for not drawing attention to those that did not join their teammates in doing so. “Hey BT Sport, why are you cutting away from the Krasnodar players not taking the knee?”one fan fumed.“Keep the camera on them and shame them #BLM.” Another added:“Worrying that this wasn t mentioned on air,”while one even responded by claiming that it’s“crazy how open racism still is in so many parts of the world.” Wow. Watching the UEFA champions league game between Chelsea and Krasnodar in Russia and they took a knee for the end racism campaign and more than half of Krasnodar team stood. Just crazy how open racism still is in so many parts of the world. French team Marseille received similar censure after none of their players joined Manchester City in kneeling before the English side’s 3-0 victory in their game on Tuesday. Olympique Marseille players refused to take a knee in tonight s game vs Mancity. Absolutely disgracefullypic.twitter.com/fsBe01CvfH Kneeling in solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement became customary in the Premier League when football resumed in June as part of the widespread protests against racial inequality and police brutality, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin - who has been charged with murder - in May. However, the custom of kneeling before games has not been adopted in France or Russia, and Marseille’s players instead stood together along the center circle. Reports in France have suggested the players wanted to pay respects to Samuel Paty - a teacher who was beheaded in a terrorist attack in Paris last week - with a minute’s silence. UEFA has said players are free to kneel if they chose, or to remain standing. In regards to Krasnodar, several Twitter users came to the defense of the players who stood. “Isn’t it your own right? Doesn’t mean they are racist?”asked one, while another questioned:“Why is this news? Trying to push that they are racist?” “Absolutely ridiculous!”exclaimed a third.“So people don’t have a choice whether to support a cause or not?” Isn’t it your own right ? Doesn’t mean they are racist ? Why is this news? Trying to push that they are racist? Absolutely ridiculous! So people don’t have a choice whether to support a cause or not? In the case of both Krasnodar and Marseille, it was perhaps the incongruous nature of their circumstances that led to the perceptions of racism. They were far from the only sides not to take a knee in the Champions League this week, where the decision to do so appeared to be random. Both sides took the knee before Manchester United’s 5-0 win over RB Leipzig. However, neither side did ahead of Juventus’ 2-0 defeat to Barcelona or Borussia Dortmund’s 2-0 victory against Zenit St. Petersburg, the latter despite vocal blacklivesmatter advocate Jadon Sancho starting for the Bundesliga outfit.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf ordered several hundred members of the stateNational Guardto deploy to Philadelphia to help quell the unrest. At least 53 police have been injured in the clashes, many of whom were struck by bricks and rocks, according to local CBS reporter Joe Holden.

Police said the order was given to“galvanize additional resources to specifically deal with looters and other in-progress crimes.”There have been 172 arrests during the two nights of unrest, including 53 looting suspects on Tuesday, police said. On the contrary, this order was given to galvanize additional resources to SPECIFICALLY deal with looters, and other priority ""in-progress"" crimes.

We are committed to hearing your concerns, answering your questions, and healing together. Wallace family members have meanwhile spoken out against the violence and theft.“Everybody out there that s looting, they re thieves,”said Anthony Fitzhugh, a cousin of Wallace.“They re opportunists.

"28 Oct, 2020","Walter Wallace Jr., the knife-wielding black man gunned down by Philadelphia police, had violent criminal past – reports","The black man shot and killed by Philadelphia police on Monday, Walter Wallace Jr., had a long criminal record that included violent offenses, local media have reported. Wallace’s death has led to riots in the city. The 27-year-old was fatally shot by officers after he reportedly ignored commands to drop a knife that he was holding. The incident sparked large protests in Philadelphia, which quickly descended into rioting and looting. Sympathetic media reports have portrayed Wallace as a husband, father and aspiring musician who struggled to overcome mental health issues, but court documents obtained by news outlets reveal he had numerous run-ins with the law. In 2017, Wallace pled guilty to robbery and assault after kicking down the door of a woman and putting a gun to her head, Fox News reported. Four years earlier, he pled guilty to assault and resisting arrest after punching a police officer in the face. PA court records show that Wallace has been arrested no less than *ten times* since 2013 - including five felony convictions ranging from Burglary to Aggravated Assault & Terroristic Threatening.pic.twitter.com/9wLiuL9jMo According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, police had responded to dozens of calls in recent months that involved disturbances at Wallace’s home, and they had even visited the address twice on Monday before returning again for the third time, which led to the fatal incident. His family claims that the third call to emergency services that day was for an ambulance to help Wallace with a psychotic episode, but that the police arrived instead. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said on Tuesday that it was not clear if the two officers who shot Wallace were aware of his condition or criminal background. A relative previously told Fox News that Wallace had struggled with mental health issues and was bipolar. He was at one stage ordered by a judge to undergo psychiatric evaluation treatment, the news station reported. Family members have stated that Wallace was bipolar. A local ABC affiliate reported that Wallace had been ordered by a judge to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in 2013. His family’s attorney, Shaka Johnson, said that Wallace was taking lithium, and suggested that the officers who arrived at the scene should have been properly trained to deal with his condition. The shooting led to mayhem in the streets of Philadelphia, prompting Governor Tom Wolf to mobilize the National Guard in a bid to restore order and stop further vandalism and looting. Police forces across the United States have been accused of carrying out racially motivated shootings and other acts of violence, following the death of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. His killing sparked riots that spread across the country, with many parts of the country still seeing blacklivesmatter demonstrations on a regular or even nightly basis.

Cities across the US have been grappling with mass protests triggered by the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans at the hands of police. Peaceful rallies have at times been followed by intense unrest and looting. The protests led by the blacklivesmatter movement have also bolstered a broader debate and discussion on police brutality and racial justice in the country.

"26 Oct, 2020",‘What Killed Michael Brown?’ is the new must-see documentary that eviscerates the mainstream narrative on race in America,"A new film streaming on Amazon uses the tragedy of Michael Brown’s death in 2014 to insightfully reveal the manipulations and machinations that distort modern-day race relations in the US.

His work can be read at RT, Counterpunch and at his websitempmacting.com/blog. He is also the host of the popular cinemapodcastLooking California and Feeling Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter@MPMActingCo ‘What Killed Michael Brown?’ is the most important documentary of the year. The film, which is exquisitely directed by Eli Steele and gloriously written and narrated by famed conservative black intellectual Shelby Steele, takes a deep dive into the tangled web of race in America through the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. From the get-go the movie jumps out at you, not with cinematic bombast, but with a subtle brilliance. The opening title sequence uses the same distinct font as Quentin Tarantino’s‘Jackie Brown’, and in so doing lets viewers know it is unabashedly challenging popular myths. This film is a searing, scintillating and staggering examination of race in America, but make no mistake – this is not some emotionalist screed or partisan polemic. It is a thoughtful, reasoned and measured commentary. Shelby Steele is armed with an impressive background in civil rights, a towering intellect and a monumental mastery of language, which allows him to confidently march viewers through the maze and minefield of race without ever misplacing a step. Steele frames the American conflict over race as a battle between ‘poetic truth’ and ‘objective truth’. Poetic truth is a distorted and partisan version of truth and is used by race hustlers and charlatans like Reverend Al Sharpton and former Attorney General Eric Holder to paint Michael Brown – who was shot by a police officer – as an innocent victim and noble martyr for the cause. This poetic truth conflates the present with the past, which results in the tragedy of Michael Brown being transformed into a continuation of slavery’s violence andJim Crow-eralynching by depraved whites. Through this paradigm, Michael Brown becomes all black people, and all black people become Michael Brown. The establishment media and racial activists embrace this poetic truth because their objective is coercion, not reason. This version of truth does two critically destructive things: it gives black people an identity through victimization, and it gives white people a way to assuage their racial guilt. As Steele explains in the film,“white guilt became black power.”This dynamic sets up a vicious cycle where blacks use victimhood to exploit white guilt, and whites steal agency from blacks in order to assuage said guilt. Therefore, the learned helplessness of blacks feeds the self-centered, narcissistic paternalism of whites and vice versa. Steele goes on to insightfully declare:“humans never use race except as a means to power… never an end, always a means.”This is contrasted by the vision of Steele’s working-class, minimally educated father who grew up under Jim Crow and fervently“favored character over race as a means to power.” As seen in Ferguson in 2014 and in recent months all across America, racial anger has become ritualized and choreographed. Grievance is claimed without evidence, and protest encouraged with no good faith that it will lead to anything. Whether it be Michael Brown, George Floyd or Breonna Taylor, these deaths are seen less as tragedies and more as opportunities. The film highlights Al Sharpton as one of the more aggressive opportunists and as the epitome of the race grievance peddler. Reverend Al’s mendacious model is now used by blacklivesmatter and their ilk, who are just as intellectually and morally dubious as their duplicitous mentor. Unlike the extraordinarily successful and morally impeccable civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr., which exposed its opponents as devoid of moral authority, BLM and Sharpton are themselves morally bankrupt. As the film points out, none of these opportunists is interested in the development of black people or communities, but in ‘justice’. And their definition of ‘justice’ is amorphous, ever-expanding and rooted entirely in emotionalism and greed. Steele uses the immigrant-owned convenience store in Ferguson where the Michael Brown tragedy began as proof of the absurdity of the demand for alleged ‘justice’. The mob wants the store owners to shut down for three days on the anniversary of Brown’s death and issues a whole host of other demands. The owners acquiesce, but it is never enough. Once one demand is fulfilled, a new and more egregious one sprouts up – until finally the mob is clamoring for the owners to literally give away their store to protesters. Besides the movie’s robust intellectualism, it is also exceedingly well made and, like its soulful and melancholy jazz soundtrack, never loses its pace or rhythm. In a bizarre twist, considering the high-quality filmmaking on display, Amazon first refused to allow ‘What Killed Michael Brown?’ to run on its streaming service,claimingit“doesn’t meet Prime Video’s content quality expectations.” It’s ironic that, though major corporations like Amazon are now emphasizing black artists, when those artists don’t toe the establishment line on race, they are told to sit at the back of the bus. Thankfully, after much public pressure, Amazon has now relented and is allowing users to purchase and stream the film on its service. But this is not the first time – and it certainly won’t be the last – that mainstream gatekeepers have tried to silence truth tellers. In conclusion, ‘What Killed Michael Brown?’ is mandatory viewing, because it is an intellectually vibrant, finely crafted piece of work that brazenly and bravely reveals the uncomfortable reality of race in America today. See it now. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/504569-what-killed-michael-brown-amazon/
"22 Oct, 2020",Judge dismisses one murder charge against ex-cop Derek Chauvin over George Floyd death,"A Minneapolis judge has dismissed the third-degree murder charge against ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, who is accused of killing African-American man, George Floyd. Second-degree murder and manslaughter charges were upheld. Hennepin County judge, Peter A. Cahill, stayed the dismissal of Chauvin s third-degree murder charge for five days so that the state could appeal his ruling. He also denied motions to dismiss the aiding and abetting charges against the three other officers, who were on the scene during Floyd’s death - Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane. Chauvin was arrested in late May, several days after his attempt to detain George Floyd outside a grocery store in Minneapolis resulted in the man’s death. Videos of the incident showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes. The footage provoked month of ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere across the country, some of which erupted in violence and escalated into riots. Chauvin, who was swiftly sacked from the police, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, which was later upgraded to second-degree murder. He had been held in solitary and under maximum security at the Oak Park Heights prison before being released on $1 million bond earlier this month. The judge sustaining“the most serious charges”against the four defendants was“an important, positive step forward in the path toward justice for George Floyd, his family, our community, and Minnesota,”Attorney General Keith Ellison said in response to Thursday s ruling. “We look forward to presenting the prosecution’s case to a jury in Hennepin County,""Ellison added. The trails in the case of Floyd’s death are scheduled to resume in March. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/504270-george-floyd-officer-chauvin-charges/
"21 Oct, 2020", Disgusting : Viewers react to ABC interview of cop involved in Breonna Taylor shooting as he bemoans her killing s effect on HIM,"A Kentucky police sergeant has been eviscerated over a tone-deaf interview he gave seven months after the shooting of black EMT Breonna Taylor in her home, in which he suggests the cops actually weren’t forceful enough. Louisville Police Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was shot in the leg by Taylor’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker as he broke into the couple’s apartment with six other officers on a no-knock warrant on March 13 around 1am, argued the cops actually gave the pair too much time to respond in a Wednesday interview on ‘Good Morning America’. “What would I have done differently, the answer to that is simple now that I’ve been thinking about it,” Mattingly mused on the ABC program. “We would have either served the no-knock warrant or we would have done the normal thing we do, which is five to 10 seconds. To not give people time to formulate a plan,” he explained, suggesting that Walker had only shot him in the leg because he had had time to work out a logical response to self-identified police officers banging on the couple’s door. If that had happened…Breonna Taylor would be alive, 100 percent…Breonna Taylor is now attached to me for the rest of my life. The cop insisted they knocked six times, repeatedly identifying themselves as police, and were only then confronted by Walker’s gun. While Walker was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer, the charges were dropped amid the outcry over Taylor’s killing. Mattingly’s narrative diverges wildly from witnesses’ accounts of the incident. Twelve people, including Walker and the couple’s neighbors, countered that the intruders never revealed they were police – which led Walker to fire his gun at what he thought were home invaders. Worse, the target of the raid – Taylor’s ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover – was already in custody when she was shot, and no drugs or any evidence of drug trafficking were found in the raid. In a rare acknowledgement of culpability, Louisville banned no-knock warrants amid the outcry that followed the shooting. Mattingly tore into Louisville politicians and even police leadership for not correcting the “false narratives” surrounding Taylor’s death in the four-hour interview, denying the case was “relatable to [Minneapolis police choking victim] George Floyd” or Georgia ex-police shooting victim Ahmaud Arbery. “It’s not a race thing like people wanna try to make it be. It’s not.” The cop’s interview aired the day after a grand juror in the case against the three officers responsible for Taylor’s death revealed the jury was not actually allowed to consider homicide charges in the case. Instead, the Kentucky Attorney General only presented them with the endangerment charge, and that was against just one officer. Public outcry across the US, including riots in Louisville, followed the jury’s decision to charge just Mattingly’s colleague Brett Hankison with “wanton endangerment” for shooting into a neighbor’s apartment, with many believing all three cops should have been charged with her murder. A total of 32 shots were fired into Taylor’s apartment, six of which hit Taylor who died in the hallway of her building. Mattingly acknowledged “she didn’t deserve to die,” noting “she didn’t do anything to deserve a death sentence,” but insisted it was not the police who were to blame. He complained he and his family regularly receive death threats and lamented that after 20 years of service to the Louisville Police Department, they have not stood by him. Taylor has since become a symbol of police misconduct for the blacklivesmatter movement, her name often chanted along with the likes of Floyd, Arbery, New York police choking victim Eric Garner, and Baltimore police “rough ride” victim Freddie Gray. That movement was not pleased to see Mattingly trotted out on GMA as if he was the real victim of the shooting.

"21 Oct, 2020","UK minister slams schools for uncontested teaching of ‘white privilege’ & ‘inherited racial guilt,’ claiming it BREAKS THE LAW","The UK’s minister for women and equalities has stated that teaching political ideas such as “white privilege” and “critical race theory” as fact is illegal, adding that schools have a duty to remain politically impartial. Speaking on Tuesday as the UK Parliament debated Black History Month, Junior Minister Kemi Badenoch warned against the decolonization of the curriculum“for the simple reason that it is not colonized.” The minister also hit out at current trends, claiming she doesn t want white pupils to be taught about“white privilege and their inherited racial guilt.” I want to speak about a dangerous trend in race relations that has come far too close to home in my life, which is the promotion of critical race theory, an ideology that sees my blackness as victimhood and their whiteness as oppression. The minister claimed that some schools have ignored their duty to be politically impartial by supporting the anti-capitalist blacklivesmatter (BLM) group, which she labeled as a political organization. She noted the example of a white BLM protester calling a black armed police officer“a pet n*****r.” Addressing her colleagues, the minister stated that the government does not support the teaching of contested political ideas, in which she included critical race theory, without offering a balanced view, adding that the curriculum does not do this with communism, socialism or capitalism. Badenoch, of Nigerian descent herself, was also critical of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, describing his agenda as“turning the curriculum into a list of all the things that Britain has done wrong to people of a certain race,”adding it distorts UK history. The minister s remarks have caused vigorous debate across social media, with many people happy to see the government standing up against the left-wing and BLM agendas. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage commended Badenoch for speaking up and showing courage. It is good to see someone in the Tory party with moral courage.pic.twitter.com/DoRmMi7zIB MUST WATCH: Equalities Minister@KemiBadenochrips in to#CriticalRaceTheoryand the#BLMorganisation - these movements are not an innocent anti racism campaign, it s political ideology and should be treated as such!

Throughout October, the UK is observing Black History Month, in which the country celebrates the achievements of the minority ethnic group. The observance has become of greater significance to many following the spate of anti-racism and BLM protests earlier in the year triggered by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.

"16 Oct, 2020","San Francisco looks to rename 44 schools, expunging the likes of Washington, Lincoln and even FEINSTEIN for their impurities","Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt are among the historical figures whose names are no longer considered honorable enough to adorn public schools in San Francisco. The city s school board is looking to rename as many as 44 of the 125 public schools in its district after a panel of community members appointed to study the issue found their namesakes to beproblematicby today s standards of woke conduct, the local ABC television affiliate reported. The committee s review criteria targeted colonizers, slave owners, perpetrators of genocide, racists, human-rights violators, environmental abusers and those who oppressed or abused women, children, gay or transgender people. Three of the four men whose faces were sculpted on Mt. Rushmore failed to measure up, including the president who pushed through the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in the US. The committee found all three to have connections to slavery, genocide or oppression, so Abraham Lincoln High School, George Washington High School and Jefferson Elementary may be renamed. Roosevelt Middle School also was put on the renaming block after Franklin Roosevelt, the only four-term US president, was deemed problematic. Even US Senator Dianne Feinstein was found to have insufficient moral purity, meaning Feinstein Elementary may get a new name. The staunch Democrat was faulted for reportedly replacing a vandalized Confederate flag back in 1986, when she was San Francisco s mayor. Other namesakes who didn t make the grade includedPaul Revere, the revolutionary silversmith who warned of the British invasion in 1775; Francis Scott Key, who wrote the lyrics to the national anthem; and abolitionist poet James Lowell. One committee member also pushed – apparently unsuccessfully – for the canceling of Thomas Edison Elementary because the inventor electrocuted stray dogs and cats in demonstrations of his findings. The school board has asked principals of the affected schools and parents of students to submit suggestions for new names by December 18. The board plans to vote on any name changes in January or February. It may decide to keep the current names of at least some of the 44 schools targeted for renaming by the committee. If we cannot even agree on our founding, there needs to be a serious discussion whether the American experiment is over and how to divide up the territories. We are clearly no longer one people and power from one side is necessarily oppression of the other side. The renaming push comes amid a left-wing war on history that has toppled statues ranging from Confederate generals to founding fathers, and from President Theodore Roosevelt to aniconic elkthat had stood in downtown Portland for 120 years. San Francisco s school board voted last year to cover up 1930smuralsat George Washington High School because they depicted slaves and a dead Native American man. Local media reports noted opposition to changing school names, including a statement by San Francisco MayorLondon Breedthat devoting resources to the initiative is“offensive”given that the buildings remain closed to in-person classes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Twitter commenters were more focused on the mental state of San Francisco s decision-makers, calling the move“more sickness,”“coocoo”and“going too far.”Others suggested new names that might be more appreciated in San Francisco, including Lenin, Stalin,Marx, Mao, Pelosi and George Floyd. Each state will have at least one George Floyd school within 5 years. One observer said the controversy reflects a broken political system:“If we cannot even agree on our founding, there needs to be a serious discussion whether the American experiment is over and how to divide up the territories.”Another pointed out the lack of nuance in cancel culture, saying,“Imagine never possessing the capacity to realize the complex mix of good and bad that every human has within. Everyone can be canceled by today s thin criteria.” imagine never possessing the capacity to realize the complex mix of good and bad that every human has within. everyone can be canceled by today’s thin criteria.

However, reaction both online and from city authorities indicates the situation doesn’t quite mirror cities elsewhere in the US. The contentious monument was torn down by a group of around 40 activists in 20 minutes or so following three days of protests around the federal holiday. Columbus Day has long been a source of controversy in the US, with many arguing that celebrating the explorer glorifies colonialism. Some states, including New Mexico, have ditched the holiday, observing Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead. The obelisk is torn down@ABQJournalpic.twitter.com/Ch3M8B5doR Police were reportedly absent at the time the monument was torn down, having conducted a tactical retreat after officers were assaulted, before returning in greater numbers with reinforcements from New Mexico State Police and the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Two men were arrested in connection with the toppling of the monument: Sean Sunderland, 24, was charged with resisting and criminal trespass while Dylan Wrobel, 27, charged with battery on a peace officer and resisting an officer. Mayor Alan Webber decried the actions of the protesters, saying the“wanton destruction of the Obelisk was completely unacceptable. That’s not how we do things in Santa Fe.” “There is no place for people taking the law into their own hands. There is no place for people destroying historic monuments on their own,”Webber added. Reaction online was mixed betweensupportersof the movement torectifyhistorical injustice and stop lauding historical oppressors, and those who see such actions as utterly futile.

This will no doubt end racism and oppression City workers had erected barriers around the monument, erected in 1866 to honor Civil War-era soldiers, to protect it, but protesters still managed to lasso it with a rope and tear it down. Webber had previously ordered the obelisk removed but it was too heavy, so only the offending plaque which bore an inscription referencing the Pueblo people as ‘Savage Indians’, was taken away. The incident is the latest such removal of statues from bygone eras seen by social justice movements as oppressive. Numerous statues of slave owners and conquerors have been torn down across the world in recent months amid the groundswell of racial justice marches which began in the US with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

"12 Oct, 2020",What a turn-off: TV ratings for NBA Finals PLUMMET as social justice campaigning blamed as factor in fans tuning out,"The 2020 NBA Finals have seen an enormous drop in ratings compared with last year, and the league’s vocal support of social justice issues has been suggested as one of the factors behind it. According toTV Line, Sunday’s NBA Final decider between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat – which the former won 106-93 to take the series 4-2 – drew in 5.5 million viewers, but last year’s final game between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors had an audience of18.9 million, signifying a 71 percent decrease in viewership. Game 5 drew in5.7 millionviewers, down almost 70 percent from the18.2 millionwho tuned in to watch the same game last year. There have been suggestions throughout the playoffs that the enormous gulf in viewership compared to last year has partly been due to the NBA’s increasingly vocal response to social justice issues this season. The blacklivesmatter slogan has been displayed on the courts in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with murder. Players were also allowed to display BLM and “Equality” messages on their jerseys. In August, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted a game against Orlando Magic after a black man named Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by Wisconsin police. Texas senator Ted Cruz tweeted that news of the NBA’s falling ratings was “not surprising.” He added:“Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals. #GoWokeGoBroke” Not surprising. Personally speaking, this is the first time in years that I haven’t watched a single game in the NBA Finals.#GoWokeGoBrokehttps://t.co/ygIp60EKHi NBA commissioner Adam Silverhas suggestedthe league won’t be as explicit with its social justice messaging next season. He said that while the NBA is“completely committed to standing for social justice and racial equality,”he predicts next year“there’ll be somewhat a return to normalcy, that those messages will largely be left to be delivered off the floor.” However, while the messaging has evidently been off-putting for a section of the NBA fanbase this season, the severe decline in ratings appears to have a number of factors behind it. Veteran NBA coach George Karl certainly had strong views, issuing an X-rated rant over the slump attacking US President Donald Trump. There is talk of bad NBA ratings on TV. There are lots of reasons for that. The Leagues messages on social injustices isn’t one of them. But, fuck Trump!!And now I feel better... PerKWWL.com, an NBA spokeswoman said that health and safety was the primary concern in organizing this year’s Finals, rather than optimizing them for TV ratings. The games have been played behind closed doors in the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida as a result of the pandemic, diminishing the product on display without fans in the stadiums. What’s more, the delay in the season caused by Covid-19 means the Finals have been played in direct competition with the NFL, which would not have been an issue had the season finished in June as normal. The NBA has not been the only sport to suffer such a decline, either. PerYahoo Finance, the audience for the NHL playoffs dropped by 25 percent – including a 61 percent drop for the Stanley Cup finals – overall, while MLB’s playoffs have suffered a 39 percent decline. The NFL’s early viewing figures show a 14 percent decrease in viewership. ",https://www.rt.com/sport/503283-nba-finals-tv-ratings-fall/
"12 Oct, 2020","‘Taking advantage of fools’: Trump weighs in on Portland violence, implores city to ‘call in the Feds!’","US President Donald Trump mocked authorities and rioters in Portland calling them “fools” while sharing footage of the so-called “Day of Rage” in which alleged indigenous activists tore down statues of former presidents. The US president’s bombastic multi-tweet broadside began early Monday morning, after a night of violence once again reduced central Portland to something resembling a warzone. Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb “leadership” fools. This is Biden! Law & Order!https://t.co/w0yH3SqnrB “Put these animals in jail, now. The Radical Left only knows how to take advantage of very dumb “leadership” fools. This is Biden! Law & Order!”he tweeted. A 200-strong group of rioters, many of whom wore body armor, carried shields and brandished blunt weapons like clubs, bats and night sticks, tore down several statues including those of former presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln before shattering the entrance to the Oregon Historical Society. Trump described them as“animals,” “Biden fools,”and “Antifa radicals” in a series of tweets. These are Biden fools. ANTIFA RADICALS. Get them FBI, and get them now!https://t.co/RI9fH6sC1g Riots ripped through the city s downtown district late Sunday through the early hours of Monday, with agitators smashing storefronts and wreaking havoc on the beleaguered city which has witnessed non-stop protests and violence since May. Portland police declared a riot, but did not intervene until almost an hour after the first statue was torn down. Trump abrasively stated that local authorities were“fools”who were being taken advantage of, urging city and state leaders to call for federal agency support, despite the failure of federal authorities to quell the ongoing riots in the city during the summer. Taking advantage of fools. Law & Order! Portland, call in the Feds!https://t.co/rJl9IVxdMM Sunday night’s protest was billed as an“Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage”by organizers on social media, who called for“direct action.” Monday is the federally-observed Columbus Day holiday, though many states and cities now refer to it as“Indigenous Peoples Day”in opposition to the violence perpetrated by Christoper Colombus and his conquistadors who conquered the Americas. Organizersreportedlyrequested that local journalists and live streamers stay away from the event so as not to potentially incriminate those tearing down the statues with their coverage. They also reportedly threatened and even assaulted those who were caught filming, shining laser pointers in their eyes or dousing them in liquid. Trump signed off by calling on federal agencies to combat the violence witnessed in cities across the US over the summer since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. “The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left, those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!”hesaid.

Footage shows a crowd cheering as the statue of Roosevelt mounted on a horse is pulled down.

"9 Oct, 2020",Trump slammed by left for ‘blacksplaining to black people’ over comments calling BLM ‘Marxist’ & ‘racist’ on Rush Limbaugh show,"President Donald Trump has angered liberals, including CNN’s Don Lemon, by criticizing the “Marxist” blacklivesmatter movement during his two hour appearance on Rush Limbaugh’s radio program. In a conversation that covered a wide array of topics, Limbaugh and the president eventually turned their attention to BLM, which has been behind numerous protests across the country, some turning violent and destructive, since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “Don’t forget, blacklivesmatter , what was blacklivesmatter ?”Trump said of the movement’s, which he has called a“symbol of hate,”beginnings. The president went on to recall the BLM protesters chanting“pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon”in reference to the police. “‘Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon.’ The first time I ever heard of blacklivesmatter , I said, ‘that’s such a terrible term’ because it’s such a racist term. It’s a term that sows division between blacks and whites everybody else,”he said. “It’s a very bad term for blacks,”Trump added, calling BLM a“Marxist movement”and again condemning the“pigs in a blanket”statement.

"9 Oct, 2020",Yelp’s accusation-based racism warning on restaurants encourages mob thuggery in the name of social justice,"User-generated review directory Yelp has made it easier for cancel-culture enthusiasts to wreak havoc on businesses, rolling out a scarlet letter for companies “accused of racism” that practically cries out to be abused. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram “Review-bombing” has long been a tactic of social-media intimidation on review sites like Yelp – an angry mob (or a competitor) targets a restaurant’s page by claiming they’ve all found dead cockroaches or hair in their food, or insists a store-owner called them nasty names. To Yelp’s credit, it eventually caught on to this practice and began freezing pages experiencing an unusually high amount of traffic with a “Public Attention Alert” warning users some reviews are likely not based on actual customer experiences and preventing new ones from being added. But while the “Public Attention Alert” was an all-purpose freeze, serving to paralyze the pages of businesses both targeted by and accused of racist behavior and other scandals, Yelp has apparently decided that didn’t go far enough in separating the perpetrators from the victims. The new “Business Accused of Racist Behavior Alert” makes it clear that the owner of any page bearing the warning is guilty of the worst offense one can commit in 2020 – never mind the presumption of innocence. In ablog postannouncing the feature on Thursday, Yelp stated it will be including a link to a news article with every “racist behavior alert,” implying the site needs more than just a few upset customers to apply the scarlet letter (actually a scarlet exclamation point). But the credulousness of most mainstream media outlets with regard to racist incidents – despitecountlesshoaxesin recent years – means even the most spurious allegations will likely find a taker somewhere. Social media is full of gullible joiners, people who can be persuaded to flood a business’ Yelp page with hate (ironically in the name of combating hate) by nothing more than an out-of-context photo and an emotional story. Armed with that rise in review activity and a news article confirming the claim, Yelp is free to act as judge, jury and executioner, slapping their racist behavior alert on a business that is likely already struggling due to the pandemic economic shutdowns still strangling the US economy. Any right-thinking individual who was contemplating eating or shopping there will probably reconsider – after all, no one wants to give their money to a bunch of racists. To believe that this won’t be abused by not only amoral attention-seekers and race grifters but also by economic competitors is absurdly naive. With fewer consumer dollars than ever floating around, businesses may find the easiest way to boost their own customer base is to destroy someone else’s. When a large corporation like Home Depot or Goya is ‘unmasked’ as a supporter of President Donald Trump, for example, calls to boycott inevitably follow, and their competitors see a surge in business – a phenomenon experienced by small or regional establishments as well. The racist behavior label still freezes reviews, so vengeful Yelpers can’t slag off the business on the internet. However, while the wanton destruction of commercial establishments seen across the US during the riots of the past five months has simmered down, periodic outbreaks are still leaving businesses in tatters. While the targets may not be planned, it’s not unreasonable to imagine that an establishment tagged as racist on Yelp might be specifically preyed on during the next riot. The Wendy’s where an Atlanta cop shot Rayshard Brooks in the parking lot was burned to the ground by rioters in June, not long after the killing, apparently because employees had called police to remove the unconscious Brooks, who had passed out in his car in the drive-through lane. Even if the reported racist incident is wholly accurate, the ethics of consigning a business to commercial death for what might be the actions of a single employee, especially during a recession, are dubious. If a restaurant is forced to close following a racism scandal amplified by Yelp, it’s vanishingly unlikely everyone who loses their jobs is also a racist – many will no doubt be people of color. Some 450 businesses have had warnings placed on them since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis reanimated blacklivesmatter , and the number is only growing. With unemployment at record levels in the US, what restitution does Yelp offer those who lose their jobs because its labels scared customers away? Perhaps with 60 percent of temporary business closures on the platform due to Covid-19 recently found to be permanent, Yelp has decided protecting the reputations of the businesses that use their platform is no longer a growth industry. But if this social-justice bullying continues, proprietors may find it’s more worth their while to stay off Yelp altogether. Possibly positioning itself for just such an outcome, the platform has also partnered with “Open to All,” a group that charges $10 for window decals marking a business as a no-discrimination zone, to create a diversity-training package for small businesses that can’t afford to hire a real “diversity consultant” to personally lambaste them for their racial sins. Small businesses may be dying, but race-grifting is a bull market. Just as the smearing of lamb’s blood on one’s door during Passover was supposed to protect the ancient Israelites from having their first-born sons slaughtered by an angry God, these “Open to All” signs and the “Black-Owned Business” labels Yelp adopted in June as a search feature may function as a silent plea to be spared during the next riot. But the bat-wielding sociopaths destroying property under cover of BLM don’t actually care about black lives or any other social justice cause. Yelp may be aligning itself with the mob, but do businesses really think that rioters will heed their trendy talismans? ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/503103-yelp-enables-raging-mobs-blm/

Rule 50 of the Olympic charter promotes political neutrality at the Games, banning the raising of fists or taking knees during medal ceremonies. ""No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas,"" the rule says. It has come under fire from social rights advocates, who have called for changes to Olympic restrictions in the light of recent protests and the blacklivesmatter movement, triggered by the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd. ""I ve been very clear that if an athlete chooses to take the knee on a podium then I m supportive of that,"" Coesaid. ""Athletes are a part of the world and they want to reflect the world they live in.

"9 Oct, 2020",Customer review site Yelp debuts racism alert to freeze reviews of pages engulfed in discrimination scandals,"User-generated review site Yelp has unveiled a ‘racism alert’ feature – an icon that will appear on the pages of businesses accused of discrimination. Reviewing is frozen while the accusations are investigated. Trumpeting its“zero tolerance policy to racism,”the siteannouncedthe new feature in a blog post on Thursday, explaining that while it’s great that many users have been using Yelp to air their grievances about businesses behaving in a racist manner, this is sometimes done without“actual first-hand consumer experiences with the business.” The icon, they wrote, is designed to protect both customers and businesses. Appearing beneath a warning exclamation point in a red circle, the alert will pop up when the user navigates to the page of a business“accused of racist behavior,”explaining that the media attention has triggered an influx of negative feedback and reviewing capability has temporarily been frozen. Alerts will include a link to a“news article where they can learn more about the incident.” “As the nation reckons with issues of systemic racism, we’ve seen in the last few months that there is a clear need to warn consumers about businesses associated with egregious, racially-charged actions to help people make more informed spending decisions,”the review platform said in the post. The new feature is an expansion of the previous“Public Attention Alert”warning that Yelp placed on the pages of businesses targeted by“social activism”linked by the company to the blacklivesmatter movement. Since May 26, the day after black Minneapolis man George Floyd’s death reignited BLM, Yelp claimed to have placed over 450 such alerts on businesses either targeted by or accused of racism, a 133 percent rise in“media-fueled instances”of review-bombing. Accompanying the rollout is the release of an“inclusive environment”toolkit for small businesses that don’t have the resources to inflict anti-discrimination training on their employees. It s created in partnership with Open to All – an organization that charges businesses $10 to publicize their anti-discrimination policies with a window decal and a“pledge”to welcome all customers regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or other protected characteristics. The inclusivity materials include an hourlong“unlearning bias training video for employees,”social media“assets,”and“outreach language for customers and employees.”Yelp strongly hinted that those looking to be inclusive should join the half-million-plus businesses boasting an“Open for All”icon on their pages, lest they be seen as discrimination-loving reactionaries and lose customers, stating“Increasingly, consumers across the US are voting with their dollars by supporting businesses that align with their values.” Yelp has been touting its potential as a tool for social justice for years, but the arrival of BLM has kicked things into overdrive, with reviews highlighting“black-owned businesses”up 617 percent for the summer compared to the same period last year and mentions of“women-owned businesses”increasing 114 percent. The platformdebuteda tool to specifically search for (and identify as) black-owned businesses in June. Last month, Yelp reported that 60 percent of listed businesses that closed temporarily during the economic shutdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic will not reopen, representing nearly 100,000 companies.

Floyd’s death sparked months of riots in Minnesota and across the US. The former officer was released on Wednesday morning from the Oak Park Heights prison, where he had been held in solitary and under maximum security, after posting a non-cash bond. Here s our@FOX9#BREAKINGnews coverage as Derek Chauvin has posted $1M bail & is no longer in custody.#GeorgeFloydhttps://t.co/feQkHTLra2pic.twitter.com/b9nJ4DmcAL Chauvin had been arrested on May 29, four days after Floyd died during a botched arrest outside a grocery store in Minneapolis. He had been held in Oak Park Heights since May 31, as blacklivesmatter protests over Floyd’s death turned violent and resulted in the torching of multiple businesses and the MPD Third Precinct. Video of Floyd’s arrest showed Chauvin kneeling on the African-American man’s neck for almost nine minutes. He was fired on the same day that video emerged on social media, and later charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, which was later upgraded to second-degree murder. Three other officers involved in the arrest were likewise fired, and later charged with aiding and abetting. The lawyers for all four former officers have sought to move the trial out of Hennepin County, arguing that the media coverage of Floyd’s death has prejudiced the local jury pool. Chauvin is the last of the four to be released on bail; the three others were let out between June 10 and July 4, after posting bond. Their trial has been set for March 2021.

Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic While acknowledging the dictionary definition of riot as a“wild or violent disturbance of the peace,”AP said the word somehow“suggests uncontrolled chaos and pandemonium.” Worse yet,“Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice…”the Stylebook account tweeted on Wednesday. Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality or for racial justice, going back to the urban uprisings of the 1960s. (2/5) The claim that something has been used in the past in a racist way has already led to banishing many English terms to the Orwellian“memory hole.”It certainly appears the AP is trying to do the same with“riot”now. Instead of promoting precision, the Stylebook is urging reporters to use euphemisms such as“protest”or“demonstration.”It advises“revolt”and“uprising”if the violence is directed“against powerful groups or governing systems,”in an alarming shift in focus fromwhatis being done towardswhois doing it towhom. There is even a helpful suggestion to use“unrest”because it’s“a vaguer, milder and less emotional term for a condition of angry discontent and protest verging on revolt.” Translated to plain English, this means a lot more mentions of“unrest”and almost no references to“riot,”in media coverage going forward, regardless of how much actual rioting is happening. Mainstream media across the US have already gone out of their way to avoid labeling what has unfolded since the death of George Floyd in May as“riots.”Though protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota turned violent within 48 hours, before spreading to other cities across the US – and even internationally – the media continued calling them“peaceful”and“protests for racial justice.” Yet in just the first two weeks of the riots, 20 people have been killed and the property damage hasexceeded $2 billion, according to insurance estimates – the highest in US history. AP is no stranger to changing the language to better comport to proper political sensitivities. At the height of the riots in June, the Stylebook decided tocapitalize“Black”and“Indigenous”in a“racial, ethnic or cultural sense.” A month later, the expecteddecisionto leave“white”in lowercase was justified by saying that“White people in general have much less shared history and culture, and don’t have the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color.” Moreover,“Capitalizing the term ‘white,’ as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs,”wrote AP’s vice-president for standards John Daniszewski. The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, as its full name goes, has effectively dictated the tone of English-language outlets around the world since it first appeared in 1953. It is also required reference material in journalism schools. So when it embraces vagueness over precision and worrying about“suggestions”and“subtly conveying”things over plain meaning, that rings especially Orwellian – in both the ‘1984’ sense of censoring speech and thought and regarding the corruption of language the author lamented in his famous 1946essay Politics and the English language. pic.twitter.com/s1Cwcusld5 AP is hardly the Ministry of Truth, dictating Newspeak under the penalty of torture.

I’m a former vice president. I made it clear that violence should be prosecuted.” Wallace pointed out that earlier in the debate, Biden had said“I am the Democratic Party right now,”and asked him again whether he had called leaders in Democrat-run Portland to offer guidance. “They can, in fact, take care of it if he [Trump] just stays out of the way,”Biden said.

Police claim they found a loaded handgun inside a vehicle purporting to be an amateur medical transport for the protesters. Driver, Jason Dye, 40, of Portland was issued multiple citations for driving offences and an investigation into the handgun has been launched. Protesters wearing heavy body armour marked with ""press"" insignia and carrying ""press"" passes were arrested while in possession of knives and pepper spray. Earlier on Monday, local authorities announced that dozens of Portland police officers who were deputized to make federal arrests will retain their powers until the end of 2020. Some 56 officers, sergeants and lieutenants from the Portland Police bureau’s rapid response team, will retain additional authority to help quell the ongoing violence in the city which has marred the protests. Their deputization does not automatically result in federal charges should they be assaulted  by violent protesters. However, several protesters are already facing federal prosecution for assaulting local Portland police officers throughout the wave of protests since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May.

Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC is a game and tech journalist from the US. Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC Of all the political activists in the United States, I can’t think of many that are as divisive as David Hogg. One of the group known as the Parkland kids (the students who survived the 2018 mass shooting at a Florida high school that left17 dead), David is known for his anti-NRA and anti-gun diatribes. He seemed to become one of the political left’s darlings. He is the poster child for gun control in the eyes of many. That in and of itself makes him one of the most divisive figures in politics of the last five years. Given what he went through and how much he’s beloved by the political left and those who describe themselves as woke, you wouldn’t expect the young man to be called out for an anti-violence stance. I mean, the entire platform that he stands on is based on this and he went to a school where there was a mass shooting. Despite my substantial disagreements with him, an opinion that comes across like a pacifist doesn’t exactly surprise me. I don’t believe it should surprise anyone. But when he decried political violence, the“Church of Woke”decided that was a sin, and he had to be punished until his mind was changed and he showed contrition. David Hogg apologizes for criticizing violence as a means of seize powerhttps://t.co/C4oHwoATdh Now, David Hogg’s ranting about imperialism, capitalism, or anything along those lines is just about akin to a first-year med student attempting to separate conjoined twins with a hacksaw. This young man has no clue what he’s talking about when it comes to philosophy. However, broken clocks are right twice a day. When it comes to the statement that violence will never create a peaceful system of government, he’s absolutely correct. Here’s what he wrote:“The use of violence to acquire political power is deeply rooted in imperialism, capitalism and white supremacy. I personally refuse to believe that the use of this same violence will ever create nonviolent systems of government that represent and support everyone.” In any other time, his statement would not be controversial, and might be approved of by his leftist friends. But when groups like blacklivesmatter and Antifa are rioting and burning and looting in the hope of fomenting a Marxist revolution in this country, he is off-message. In fact, polls are suggesting that ever since the rioting happened after the death of George Floyd, groups like BLM are becoming less and less popular. Then you have President Donald Trump stating that Antifa will be designated as a domestic terrorist group, which is obviously a popular move because of all the cities that have been on fire because of them. The reaction from people to this violence is negative. That element of what Hogg said is simply reality, and though I don’t think he’s the brightest star in the planetarium, there is no way that what he said can be deemed racist. Within hours of receiving a backlash, however, Hogg caved:“I appreciate those that have called me out and let me know how this tweet was offensive and I am welcome to continuing to learn. Many are understandably upset and offended and I have to do my part in admitting to mistakes when I make them and supporting my friends.” This is yet another great example of how the modern political left is encapsulated and what I like to call“Woke Twitter.”In previous articles, I’ve detailed that these folksactlike a cult. They exist only to destroy, and there are no sacred cows unless your name is Karl Marx (and perhaps he’s lucky he’s dead). As such, the minute that an“ally”steps out of line, they may as well prepare for 40 lashes from a cat of nine tails and a visit to Golgotha, proverbially speaking. Do I think that David Hogg is a young goofball who doesn’t know his hind end from his elbow? Absolutely. Is a lot of what he said on Twitter stupid? Most definitely. Is he a racist for what he said? No. But maybe this young man will start to realize that the people that he panders to are just as willing to sharpen the knives to use against him as they are anyone else. Which just proves his original statement was absolutely right. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/502025-david-hogg-twitter-gun-control/
"28 Sep, 2020",Ex-cop pleads NOT GUILTY to endangerment charges in Breonna Taylor shooting case,"A former Louisville police officer has pleaded not guilty to charges of wanton endangerment in connection to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. Charges against two other officers involved in the incident were dropped last week. Former Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison pleaded not guilty on Monday to three counts of wanton endangerment, one for each person he endangered in an apartment next door to Taylor’s when he fired his weapon through the dividing wall. He was indicted last Wednesday by a Grand Jury, the same day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron opted not to charge the other two officers who fired into the apartment, both of whom have been on administrative leave since the shooting. Cameron’s decision unleashed protests and chaos in Louisville, with two police officers shot in a night of rioting and destruction. The city had already been a focal point for demonstrations and riots since Taylor’s killing, with the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd further stoking public anger. Hankinson was released on bail on Monday, and will face his first pre-trial hearing on October 28. Wanton endangerment is a Class D felony in Kentucky, and Hankinson could face up to five years in prison for each count. Taylor was shot and fatally wounded as police attempted to serve a narcotics warrant on her address in March. Police battered her door open, and her boyfriend shot one of the officers in the leg. The police returned fire, hitting Taylor five times. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was unhurt in the exchange of fire. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/501977-breonna-taylor-officer-not-guilty/

Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Candace Owens, the conservative political commentator and social media sensation, has released her first book, and it could not be timelier. The book is not subtle, as its subtitle,“how black America can make its second escape from the Democrat plantation,”suggests.  It is more of a sledgehammer than a stiletto in the way it deals with Democratic arguments and their framing of American history. The tome is unapologetically partisan in favour of the republicanparty and particularly President Trump; however, even if you do not agree with Owens’ conclusion that America’s only option is four more years of The Donald, her analysis of the facts is very difficult to dispute. Many of the arguments will be familiar to people who have followed Owens’ rise online over the past few years (she has 2.6 million Twitterfollowers), but the book allows her to probe more deeply into the issues she often addresses in her viral videos. The main thrust of her thesis is that the Democratic Party has completely failed the black community on virtually every level. She argues that the party of slavery, the Confederacy and the Klan has never been an ally of black America but has merely shifted from viewing them purely as chattels to viewing them purely as votes. This argument is provocative and, in the words of fictional figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels, will get the people going. The book is mostly a political analysis, but Owens makes clear how her own life experiences have shaped her worldview.‘Blackout’is peppered throughout with references to her upbringing in Stamford, Connecticut, and specifically the influence of her grandfather. He began life as a sharecropper in North Carolina, laying out tobacco to dry out from the age of five. She recounts occasions when, in his youth, their farm was attacked by Klansmen; how his father’s drinking and philandering made him move north where he met her grandmother. Owens lived with her grandparents for a while when she was young, a time she looks back on with great fondness, and it seems to be where the bedrock of her conservative worldview was formed. Owens lays out the problems she believes are facing the black community, and how she views the Democrats as responsible. In the chapter ‘On Family’ she details how the destruction of the black family unit and rise in single motherhood has been aided and abetted by welfare programs devised by Democrats from FDR to LBJ and, more recently, Clinton and Obama. She also takes aim at Planned Parenthood, which she claims has been conducting a“black genocide”by administering abortions, pointing out that despite only accounting for 13 percent of the population, 40 percent of abortions are performed on black women. For good measure, she mentions that the organization’sfounder, Margaret Sanger, was an avowed racist. Most of the big political events of recent years are covered in the book, from Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing right up to the death of George Floyd in May this year. She uses the show trial that Justice Kavanaugh was subjected to as a perfect example of how modern feminism has moved from the advancement of women to the vilification of men. Owens likens the treatment of Kavanaugh following the accusations of sexual assault made by Kristine Blasey Ford, to those used by southern racists to justify lynchings of black men in the Jim Crow South. She excoriates the popular blacklivesmatter narrative around Floyd’s death and the entire movement. With characteristic forcefulness she demolishes the narrative that Floyd was a “gentle giant” turning his life around when he died during a botched arrest in Minneapolis, pointing out his lengthy criminal record and the autopsy which indicated he had several narcotics rolling around his system. But she says none of that matters, and Floyd has become yet another black idol. This idolatry of rappers and criminals, Owens’ argues, is yet another way the black community keeps itself down. She talks fondly of the culture of her grandfather’s generation, hard work, family values and Motown music, and damns its modern equivalent. Owens writes:“Black culture was once something to be proud of, but it no longer is. It has disintegrated into a web of likes and complacency. It is a perpetual diagnosis of our illness, running parallel to our endless denials of the antidote: the truth.” Her conclusion is one that flies in the face of theRobin DiAngelo’sof this world, that the ills of the black community are not the result of systemic racism and white supremacy, but that they are in fact“completely optional,”and the way out of them is to once again free themselves from the proverbial“plantation.” She says that much of black America has been kept in an equivalent of Plato’s Cave by the Democrats, a dishonest media, and race hustling “community leaders.” She writes that black conservatives like herself, who have“seen the light,”are likely to be met with resistance by those who still believe the shadows on the wall cast by the Democratic Party that placates them with handouts rather than a hand up. The way out of this self-inflicted misery? Voting for Trump. The book is very partisan all the way through but, as one would expect given the timing of the release, her conclusion is where it gets most to the point. Trump, whom she knows personally, is the admittedly imperfect vessel to save black America. She reiterates Trump’s question of 2016“What have you got to lose? You’re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed, what the hell do you have to lose?” While you might not like Trump after reading Owens’ analysis, it is hard to see how pulling the lever for Biden will not just result in more of the same for the black community. We’ll see in November if Owens’ message cuts through or not. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/501732-candace-owens-blackout-review/

"25 Sep, 2020", Her boyfriend shot at the cops : NBA legends earn social media wrath by daring to speak up for police in Breonna Taylor shooting,"NBA greats Charles Barkley and Shaquille O Neal have endured predictable criticism after arguing that the shooting of Breonna Taylor had been lumped in with the killing of George Floyd, offering an apparent defense of police. Stars including Los Angeles Lakers talisman LeBron James and tennis world number one Naomi Osaka have joined a chorus of public outrage this week after the verdict in the case, which centered around a botched drugs raid that resulted in Taylor being shot in her home in Louisville in March. While many had called for the police officers involved to face heavy potential punishments, the only charges that were raised in the announcement on Wednesday were brought against an officer for endangerment after they opened fire in a home next to Taylor s apartment. Eleven-time NBA All-Star Barkley said that the killings were incomparable to the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in February, the killing of George Floyd in May and other instances of unarmed African Americans being targeted by police. Charles Barkley says defunding police is a ridiculous idea. “Who are black people supposed to call? The Ghostbusters?”pic.twitter.com/LlJQfLzxUq ""The no-knock warrant is something we need to get rid of...across the board,""he told broadcasters ahead of the showdown between James s Lakers and the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. ""But I am worried to lump all these situations in together. I just feel bad that the young lady lost her life. But we do have to take into account that her boyfriend shot at the cops and shot a cop. ""So like I say, even though I am really sorry she lost her life, I just don t think we can put this in the same situation as George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery."" Barkley also claimed that the idea of defunding police would hurt black people in the US the most, adding that they would have to""call Ghostbusters""in times of trouble should the move happen, as well as adding that""rich white people""would""always have cops"". Taylor s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at the police during the incident because he believed they were intruders. They retaliated by firing more than 20 shots, hitting Taylor with five in a killing that led to the city paying Taylor s family $12 million and agreeing to reform police practices. i know Charles Barkley did NOT just say on national television — “i’m sad Breonna Taylor lost her life, but we can’t forget her boyfriend did fire at a cop first.” please tell me i heard that wrong incorrectly ... i’m honestly speechless ... I didn’t know I could be this disgusted by Charles Barkley. It’s black men like Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neil who continues to support the injustice against black folks perpetrated by cops....

"24 Sep, 2020",United States of Anarchy: Are Democratic leaders partnering with the rabble to dethrone Trump?,"The war of words between Democrats and the White House ramped up this week as Trump moved to defund cities that prevent police “from doing their jobs.” Will this partisan brinkmanship lead the US straight to the abyss in November? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge The Democratic mayors of New York City, Portland and Seattleissueda joint statement earlier this week in which they accused Donald Trump of“playing cheap political games”after the US leader disqualified their cities from receiving billions of dollars in federal support. Some may argue Trump was right to act as he did, considering that the mayors slashed the budgets of their police forces at the very same time radical activists were burning and looting Main Street. This week, Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, chastised the Democratic leaders for refusing to“undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities”amid the blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests that erupted across the country following the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in May. “We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,”Barrwrotein a statement on the Department of Justice website.“It is my hope that the cities identified… will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens.” Although there is considerable doubt as to whether Trump has the legal authority to deprive cities of federal cash – New York City, for example,receives$7 billion annually from Washington – the Republicans are not about to miss an opportunity to reprimand the Democrats, especially when the country is heading into the final lap before Election Day. With that said, however, Trump seems to have ample justification for punishing the Democrats for their handling of this hot protest season. Although politicians would be expected to demand that their police forces display restraint amid the BLM protests, a line must be drawn at full-blown anarchy. In some Democrat-run cities, however, that line never seemed to exist. And if it did exist, it was drawn so far down the road as to be altogether meaningless. Seattle: Antifa black bloc rioters force police vehicles away.#AntifaRiotspic.twitter.com/0RrQPvsimB Consider, for example, the decision by Seattle authorities in June to let protesters seize a six-square-block zone – dubbed the ‘Capitol Hill Occupied Protest’ (CHOP) – which Mayor Jenny Durkan downplayed as the“summer of love,”a remark that has not aged well. Seattle’s brave experiment in anarchistic, police-free living came to a screeching halt in just a matter of weeks aftersporadicshootingsleft two people dead and several others injured. New York City also made Barr’s blacklist, thanks to Mayor Bill de Blasio s decision tocut$1 billion from the New York Police Department’s annual budget at a time when shootings havesoared165 percent in the Big Apple and murders are up by almost 50 percent. Meanwhile, across the country in Portland, city residents just marked a grim milestone: 100 consecutive nights of protests, marred by the destruction of public and private property, violence, and even death. Incredibly, however, Mayor Ted Wheeler – who was forced to find a new home after repeated protests and even anarsonoutside the condominium complex where he was residing – has forbade law enforcement from using tear gas, perhaps the most effective deterrent against mob violence short of deadly firearms. After months of protests, police officers in Portland, Oregon, will no longer use tear gas for crowd controlhttps://t.co/x5fv5zaaCM At this point, it must be asked:“What in the hell are the Democrats thinking?”Few people would doubt the need for overhauling trigger-happy police departments. But reducing their budget to the point of redundancy, as the Democrats are doing, does not seem to be the best remedy; courting the mob at the very same time you are disparaging and decreasing funding for law enforcement is fraught with risk. So why haven’t the Democrats taken a no-nonsense stance against the troublemakers? One possible explanation is that the Democrats, who have been trying to oust Donald Trump since before he even set foot in the White House, had set a trap for the Republican leader. It seems they were anticipating that the brash, tough-talking Trump would eventually lose his patience as the rioters continued with their wave of destruction, which the mainstream media has gone togreat lengthsto sanitize. In an effort to restore some semblance of law and order, Trump would send in the cavalry with both guns blazing and a blood bath would predictably ensue – exactly the sort of calamity that would destroy any hope of reelection. If that is the game the Democrats were playing, they seriously underestimated the US leader... again. Against the advice of many Republicans, Trump has taken limited and measured actions against the rioters, letting the Democrats simmer in a stew of their own making. At the same time, he is constantly reminding Americans that the Democrats are to blame for the mayhem, which shows little sign of abating. That leaves the Democrats with just one option: blame Trump for the violence in return. “He doesn t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat, and he s stoking violence in our cities,”Bidentoldan audience during a recent stop in Pittsburgh.“He can t stop the violence because for years he s fomented it. Finally, there is one more possible reason why the Democrats have taken such a kid-glove approach to the mob, and I’ll just cut right to the chase: the Democrats may be inclined to use these street protesters in the event that Trump emerges victorious against Biden on November 3. It should not be forgotten that a number of high-ranking Democrats, includingHillary Clinton,Maxine WatersandKamala Harris, have strongly hinted at a bitter fight down the road with the Republicans. So if the Democrats’ aim really is to contest the results of the election, the most effective way of doing that is to employ a ‘color revolution’ scenario, where thousands of people – egged on by BLM and Antifa – come out onto the streets in mass protest. The Washington establishment has some experience in such things. Whether or not they would be so bold as to resort to such actions inside of their own country remains to be seen.

"24 Sep, 2020",Battlefield cyberspace? Iranian military proposes video game in which it saves George Floyd’s life,"A commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has suggested creating a video game in which the country’s militia forces would rescue George Floyd from his fatal encounter with US police. The concept was proposed by Mohammad Reza Naqdi, a senior officer of the armed forces branch, during a Wednesday conference on the Iranian military’s digital efforts. Naqdi’s idea is to“take back cyberspace”from the US by producing local content. Naqdi underscored the artistic potential for a political statement in such a game, by saying that Floyd’s death has become a“global issue.” The ‘Save George Floyd’ game is expected to be a mobile and computer game, with saving the“black citizen from the American police”being the core design element, according to Naqdi. Besides the ‘Save George Floyd’ project Naqdi also announced an animated production about“the arrival of Islamic tribes and nations to Jerusalem,”inspired by the conquest of Mecca by Islam’s prophet Mohammed in the seventh century. Naqdi s third concept was a piece of software which would give the user the ability“to offer a specific prayer in any place and time.”The official also mentioned that he would like to be personally involved in the development of this final project. The May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody resonated around the globe, sparking anti-law enforcement protests and even riots, and fueling the blacklivesmatter movement in the US. Iranian officials have since then frequently referred to the issue of racial violence in the US in their own political discussions. ",https://www.rt.com/news/501584-iran-george-floyd-game/

"23 Sep, 2020","Louisville braces for riots: One officer charged for ‘endangerment,’ not murder in Breonna Taylor case","Streets in downtown Louisville have been blocked off and police put on high alert as Kentucky authorities announced they are charging an officer involved in the fatal shooting of an African-American woman in her home. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced on Wednesday that a grand jury came back with charges against former officer Brett Hankison, who will face three counts of""first degree wanton endangerment""for the raid that claimed the life of Breonna Taylor. Taylor, 26, was killed in March during a police raid to serve a narcotics warrant. Protests over her shooting escalated into violence after the May death of George Floyd in Minnesota and the ensuing nationwide blacklivesmatter protests. Here’s the area around Jefferson Square Park, the hub of protests.pic.twitter.com/mYT5Yo0SbT The investigation found that the raid was not a“no-knock”warrant as previously believed and reported, and that a witness has testified that officers knocked and announced themselves before entering the apartment, at which point Taylor’s boyfriend fired on them, Cameron said Wednesday. The officers’ returning fire was therefore found to be justified. “If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge,”said Cameron, who is African-American himself. Louisville has braced for another riot since Monday, with concrete barriers, fencing and even vehicles brought out to block major roads and intersections. The city’s police department declared a state of emergency on Monday, in anticipation of the announcement. The Kentucky National Guard was activated around noon on Wednesday, shortly before Cameron s announcement. The US district courthouse in Louisville and the nearby US Citizenship and Immigration Services field office were shuttered for the week as well, per orders from a federal judge. The city has taken a number of steps to address Taylor’s killing since March, banning “no-knock” warrants,firingHankison for“extreme indifference to the value of human life”and violating department procedures in July, and reaching a $12 million wrongful death settlement with Taylor’s family last week. None of this seems to have mollified blacklivesmatter groups, however, who have called for arresting all three officers involved in Taylor’s death and charging them with murder. BREAKING: Louisville Police Officer Brett Hankinson has been charged with 3 felony counts of wanton endangerment for the bullets that went into other apartments. Not charged in Breonna s death at all.Given a $15,000 cash bond. No other officers are being charged.

"22 Sep, 2020",Democrats cry ‘fascism’ as Florida Gov. DeSantis proposes making participation in ‘disorderly assemblies’ a FELONY,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called for a harsh crackdown on violent and “disorderly” protests, proposing a bill that would bring steep penalties for rioting. Critics insist the law is a “fascist” ban on free expression. The Republican governor introduced thenew lawduring a Monday press conference – the Combating Violence, Disorder, and Looting and Law Enforcement Protection Act – which, if passed by the state legislature, would make participation in“disorderly assemblies”a third-degree felony, among other measures. Today I announced bold legislation that creates new criminal offenses and increases penalties for those who target law enforcement and participate in violent or disorderly assemblies. We will always stand with our men and women in uniform who keep our communities safe.pic.twitter.com/ITl5GmmrZJ “Our right to peacefully assemble is one of our most cherished as Americans, but throughout the country we’ve seen that right being taken advantage of by professional agitators, bent on sowing disorder and causing mayhem in our cities,”DeSantis said in a statement. I will not allow this kind of violence to occur here in Florida. The law would mandate minimum six-month sentences for anyone found guilty of striking a police officer –“including with a projectile”– during a violent protest, and upgrade offenses such as blocking roadways, public harassment and destruction of monuments to felonies. It defines“disorderly assemblies”as“when 7 or more persons are involved in an assembly and cause damage to property or injury to other persons.” Among its more controversial provisions, the legislation will also pull state resources from cities and counties that vote to defund their police departments, and establish legal protections for motorists if they accidentally hit somebody while escaping protesters’ wrath: Driver is NOT liable for injury or death caused if fleeing for safety from a mob. Though DeSantis argued the law would act as a strong deterrent against rioting and violence amid months of chaotic protests against police brutality, his Democrat detractors denounced it as a“fascist”crackdown on Americans’ right to protest and assemble. Some insisted it would empower police to declare all future demonstrations“violent”to shut them down by force. DeSantis is a fascist, pass it on. Every protest is immediately going to be declared violent. Also not holding drivers accountable that plow down protesters? There’s SO much here to unpack. Fuck all of this.https://t.co/5W32PwKG7t So if I m peacefully protesting and the guy 10 feet away from me decides to go rogue, I can be arrested by association? Sounds a bit Fascist. ""The Defense of Hitting Protesters With Your Car Act."" This is an invitation to fascist, vigilante violence. Be proud. One critic suggested the bill was merely a ploy to“distract”from the governor’s“disastrous covid response,”also observing that it proposes charges related to racketeering for protest organizers. Ron Desantis announced horrific legislation to distract from his disastrous covid response. It includes: 3rd degree felonies for obstructing traffic, withholding state funds, unemployment ineligibility for protestors, no bail before hearing, RICO efforts to identify organizers.pic.twitter.com/umMjg8GHWr You announced that Florida is a Police State. The American Civil Liberties Union also blasted the proposed legislation as“undemocratic,”saying its primary effect would be to“silence, criminalize, and penalize Floridians who want to see justice for Black lives lost to racialized violence and brutality at the hands of law enforcement.” Instead of addressing the violence protesters in cities across the state have been subjected to at the hands of law enforcement, Gov. DeSantis is doubling down on his disdain for dissent. This is not what democracy looks like.https://t.co/OinprWggMo Despite the vocal opposition, the bill found support among conservatives who suggested it could serve as a“model for the nation,”or at least for other Republican governors. This is fantastic and every Republican governor in the country should be pushing similar proposalshttps://t.co/fbOEjlxxDK I love this, this legislation could be a model for the nation, ty for taking the lead in protecting Americans from those who would do harm Common sense approach. This should isolate the criminal mercenaries that step on peaceful protest and eliminate their presence. One supporter evencalled on the governorto“make sure all the [district attorneys] in all 67 districts in Florida stand firm and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,”pointing to a number of other cities around the US where local prosecutors havedeclined to pursue chargesfor protesters. I have no problem with this as a bleeding heart liberal. Just so long as you don t go after the ones that are peaceful. We do still have that right in this country by the way. So far, over 100 people have been arrested in Orlando in connection to the ongoing blacklivesmatter protests, which have gripped scores of American cities since the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement in May. While most of those arrested have been charged with misdemeanors such as disorderly conduct, if DeSantis gets his way future rioters will face much harsher penalties. More recent demonstrations over the police killing of Salaythis Melvin in August saw protesters blocking the roadways, which the new law would make a felony offense.

"21 Sep, 2020",Disrupting Western family structure no longer among BLM s stated goals as manifesto vanishes from website ahead of US election,"The blacklivesmatter activism group has deleted a page called ""What We Believe"" from its website, disappearing such objectives as disrupting the ""Western-prescribed nuclear family structure"" as the Nov. 3 election nears. The manifesto was published on BLM s""What We Believe""page at least as long ago as on February 2 but was no longer available as of last Friday. The page is now blank, except for an error message indicating that itcan t be found. BLM gave no explanation for its missing manifesto; nor did it offer a comparable replacement, forcing all those curious about the movement’s goals to go to an“about”page, which, in rather general terms, explains its mission to eradicate white supremacy and""intervene in violence inflicted on black communities.”It does not, however, include a belief, featured in the original manifesto, that“the nuclear family structure”should be consigned to the dustbin of history. “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable,”the now-vanished-without-a-trace manifestostated. The group also spoke out at length against""heteronormative thinking,""""patriarchal practice,""men-centered environments and""cisgender privilege,""among other peeves, while repeatedly referring to the supporters of the movement as“comrades.” Whether BLM made an unlikely turnaround, or concluded that now is not a good time for a list of its core beliefs to be made readily available to anyone with a Web connection, is up for speculation. Twitter users erred on the side of temporary concealment over any change in values. One said,""They still want it -- they just put it on thesecret menu.""Another said,""They decided it does notpoll well,""while still another said,""The last thing they want is for anybody to know what they rereally all about."" Deleting the manifesto doesn’t change what they believe, everyone finding out is just exposing their depravity. So cleanse it. I hope someone screenshot the manifesto. This isn’t a renouncement. BLM enjoyed strong public support when a wave of anti-racism protests across the nation began following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, but its popularity has faded as initially peaceful protests against police brutality descended into riots, arson and outright violence. A Politico-Morning Consultpollpublished earlier this month showed that 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of BLM, down from 61 percent in June. Coincidentally, the page disappeared at just about the same time as the New York Times quietly changed the introduction for its controversial 1619 Project, a revisionist tale of US history that President Donald Trump decried as an anti-American,""twisted web of lies.""Without posting a correction or clarification, the Times removed thecentral claimand namesake point of the project – the assertion that America s true founding was in 1619, not 1776.

"21 Sep, 2020","‘We’ll take care of business’: Trump downplays threats of Democrat violence if he wins re-election, but vows tough response","President Donald Trump is largely avoiding discussion of the threats of post-election violence made by left-wing groups, but when pressed on the issue, he says any such mayhem will be quickly quashed. “We want to win, and once we win, we’ll take care of business,”Trump said in an interview with podcast host Dan Bongino, posted on Monday.“We’ll take care of business.” Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, noted that groups such as theTransition Integrity Project– which has ties to billionaire activism donorGeorge Soros– have pledged a“street fight”if Trump tries to claim victory in the November 3 election. The interview with Trump was recorded on Friday, just before Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. The prospect of Trump filling another seat on the court added more vitriol to the nation’s already toxic political divide. Former CNN host Reza Aslan was among the leftists who threatened violence if a Trump nominee is confirmed by the Senate this year, saying,“Over our dead bodies. Literally,”and adding,“If they even try to replace RBG, we will burn the entire f***ing thing down.” Over our dead bodies. Literally.https://t.co/rQbvuKakHU And he wasn’t the only one.Beau Willimon, producer of Netflix’s‘House of Cards’, said Democrats are“shutting this country down”if Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell try to ram through a Ginsburg replacement. Democrat lawmakers, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts), have repeatedly called for violence during Trump’s presidency. Pressley said last month that“there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there’s unrest in our lives.” Trump has blamed politicians in Democrat-run cities for enabling the violent blacklivesmatter and Antifa protests that have occurred across the country since May, when George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody. The Department of Justice said on Monday that New York, Seattle, and Portland have been branded“anarchist jurisdictions”and therefore won’t receive federal law enforcement funding because they have refused to“undertake reasonable measures”to counteract crime. Trump told Bongino that rioting and rising crime would be easily quelled in such cities if they were willing to accept federal government help. “The greatest would be Portland,”he said.“I could stop that in a half-hour. That’s easy. They’re anarchists. They’re spoiled kids for the most part. They live in the basement of their mother’s home.”He added that such“agitators”would like to see an overthrow of the government, but“that’s not going to happen. The country has great spirit.” Bongino also pressed Trump on what would happen if Twitter and other social media companies tried to block him from getting his messages out in the aftermath of a contested election.“I would take it right to the Supreme Court,”the president said, adding that his administration would do everything possible to strip social media platforms of their Section 230 liability protections. “The funny thing is, I protect them more than the Democrats,”he said.“I actually protect them, because I want to see great companies – I don’t want to see China take over. I think [even] the Democrats would want to repeal Section 230.”He predicted that social media giants would go out of business, were they to lose their Communications Decency Act liability shield.

"21 Sep, 2020",Nebraska bar owner who shot black protester dead in ‘self-defense’ takes own life ahead of prosecution,"Jake Gardner, an ex-Marine who shot James Scurlock during May riots outside his Nebraska bar in apparent self-defense, has ended his life by suicide. He was due to face trial for the shooting, pressed for by BLM activists. As protests against the killing of George Floyd spread beyond Minneapolis and across the US, Gardner and his father attempted to warn off a crowd of rioters outside their bar in Omaha, Nebraska. When two rioters tackled him from behind, Gardner fired a warning shot, before shooting 21-year-old Scurlock, who allegedly tried to attack him from the front. Scurlock died, and while Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine initially declined to press charges, he reversed course last week under pressure from blacklivesmatter activists. Gardner was charged with manslaughter, attempted assault, unlawful use of a firearm, and terroristic threats. A warrant for his arrest was issued on Friday, but he was found dead on Sunday outside a medical clinic near Portland, Oregon. His attorney told reporters that Gardner died“at his own hand,”and had fled Omaha after the shooting as“there was great risk”to his safety. The lawyer added that the charges came as a shock to Gardner, calling the shooting“a clear case of self-defense.” After killing Scurlock, Gardner was vilified by BLM activists. His own cousin took to Twitter to call the former Marine a“white supremacist,”and scores of rioters were arrested during the BLM protests that followed. Reacting to Gardner’s death, BLM activist Shaun King described his suicide as a denial of justice. Even Nebraska State Senator Megan Hunt shared the news of his death bywriting“Jake Gardner is gone, but the white supremacist attitudes that emboldened him are still with us today.” Unbelievable. White supremacist Jake Gardner was indicted for the murder of a young Black man named James Scurlock. A warrant was issued for his arrest LAST WEEK. But the POLICE NEVER WENT TO ARREST HIM. Today he committed suicide. Not justice.https://t.co/vbpqmzYKGJ However, there isn’t much evidence that Gardner harbored any white supremacist or racist beliefs. In video footage from 2017, he was interviewed at the inauguration of President Donald Trump.

"21 Sep, 2020", It won’t bring change : English club QPR snaps back at critics after ditching take a knee protests,"English Championship club Queens Park Rangers have hit out at critics of their decision to not take a knee ahead of a recent game, saying that the message behind the ongoing social justice campaign has been lost. Players from both QPR and Coventry opted to forgo the pre-match ritual which has been commonplace in English football, and throughout the rest of the world, in the wake of the death of George Floyd in May and the resulting protests which have been galvanized by the blacklivesmatter movement. This was the first time that a recent televised game in England began without players from either team briefly kneeling before kick-off - but Director of Football Les Ferdinand said that the decision wasn t made through a lack of support for racial equality, but rather because the club feels that the gesture has become diluted . ""We have noted with great interest a number of people within football and media questioning our decision not to take the knee before the game,"" Ferdinand said in a statement released by the club Monday afternoon. ""The decision - which was made jointly with Coventry City and the match referee ahead of the fixture - was not made to suggest a lack of support for the blacklivesmatter movement. 📝 We have issued a statement following comments made about#QPR’s decision not to ‘take the knee’. ""This should not be about QPR. Many clubs did not take the knee on the opening weekend, yet this was not reported. ""Taking the knee was very powerful but we feel that impact has now been diluted. In the same way Clap For Carers was very emotional for us all, it got to a stage where it had run its natural course and the decision was rightly made to stop it. ""Does that mean we, as a nation, don t care or appreciate our NHS workers? Of course it doesn t."" Former England international striker Ferdinand, who is black, also stated that he has been a vocal supporter of racial equality issues throughout his career but says that fundamental change can only come about by actions - not by gestures - also noting that a QPR underage team was forced to abandon a game a year ago because of racist abuse they were receiving from the stands. ""Taking the knee will not bring about change in the game - actions will,"" Ferdinand continued. ""Those media that have been quick to question us should be looking more inwardly. Our Under 18s were forced to abandon a game in August 2019 against AD Nervion FC due to racist abuse. ""What media coverage has been given to that? Not nearly as much as what has been granted to QPR not taking a knee. ""Don t judge us. Simple research and evidence will show you we are doing more than most. If you want change, judge yourselves."" 🔈Here’s a statement from our Chair@SanjayKickItOut, in response to comments surrounding players either taking or not taking a knee at the weekend 👇🏿👇🏾pic.twitter.com/VKUt4TTVus Anti-Racism watchdog Kick It Out, noting QPR s stance, released comments of their own advising players that they advocate for their rights to peacefully protest in any way they see fit without fear of sanction from their club or another governing body.

"20 Sep, 2020",On Contact: New black militancy,"On the show this week, Chris Hedges discusses the rise of the new black militancy with film director and producer Mobolaji Olambiwonnu. Olambiwonnu s new documentary is called‘Ferguson Rises’.https://www.gofundme.com/f/ferguson-rises-racial-healing-documentary YouTube channel:On Contact Follow us on Facebook:Facebook.com/OnContactRT Podcast:https://soundcloud.com/rttv/sets/on-contact Chris Hedges:Welcome to On Contact.  Today we discuss the rise of the new black militancy with film director Mobolaji Olambiwonnu. Mobolaji Olambiwonnu:I mean the whole idea of my intention in making this film was really to demonstrate that that the healing and the freedom comes from standing up. You know, we don t--we can t--we don t have control over the laws. We don t have controls of the people in power per se, but we do have control over ourselves and our ability to stand up, and to speak up, and then that freedom comes from that.  And I saw the faces of people and I got a sense that they were really experiencing a level of freedom they had never experienced before in their lives.  Despite the fear, despite the terror of tear gas, and rubber bullets, et cetera, they were experiencing freedom that needs to be recognized and acknowledged.  When you stand up, you re free. CH:The police murders of young black men and women in the United States an average of three a day, along with a constant judicial and police harassment of those living in what Malcolm X called, our internal colonies, have given birth to a new black militancy.  Nowhere was this more evident than in Ferguson, Missouri, following the murder of the teenager Michael Brown on August 9th, 2014.  His killing by police which saw his body left in the street for some four hours, sparked widespread protests that compounded recently by the police murder of George Floyd, has seen not only the abuse and indiscriminate lethal force employed by police decried.  But the chronic poverty and desperation spawned by predatory corporate capitalism.  This new militancy does not place its faith in electoral politics, the courts, and legislative reform.  It loathes the corporate press and rejects many established black leaders from Barack Obama to Jesse Jackson.  It understands that it is only in the streets through sustained acts of civil disobedience, that genuine change is possible.  The new documentary film ""Ferguson Rises"" looks at the origins of this militancy in Ferguson and what it means for the United States.  Joining me to discuss the film is its director Mobolaji Olambiwonnu.  So, I thought the film was wonderful on many levels, but I m going to begin with what I thought was really unique and I thought powerful, and that was your decision to go to Ferguson and interview the white community.  Talk a little bit about that.  And I think what it illustrated so powerfully was that even people living within the same city, I m talking about white, the white population, has just no idea what reality is like for black people on the streets around them. MO:Yeah, I mean, it was a really difficult thing to actually accomplish because many people were apprehensive of a young African-American filmmaker interviewing them and they felt like it was--it was potentially going to be a hatchet job.  And so it was very difficult to get a lot of white citizens to agree.  But we were able to get some to agree and I think that was really crucial in terms of being able to give a balance to the documentary so we can see the humanity that exists on both sides but also the challenges that exist on both sides as well. CH:Were you surprised at how clueless they were?  And talk a little bit about how you would characterize their own understanding.  They were just befuddled.  They couldn t--I mean it was--I thought it was just some remarkable clips.  But talk a little bit about how you would characterize their understanding of what happened and whether that surprised you. MO:As--I mean, as an immigrant myself to this country who had to learn.  I came when I was nine-years-old from Nigeria.  So, I had to learn what it was like to be African-American, so I discovered many of these things by virtue of being a black person in this country.  So it actually didn t come as much of a shock to me because they--I had that similar sort of cocooned experience, except, you know, by virtue of being an African person and being a Black person, I was broken out of that, but they have, you know, they have very little, if any, opportunities to really break them out of that mindset.  So it wasn t as surprising.  I think what was more surprising to me was that--was that they didn t really understand that those views were sort of linked or connected to some level of racism.  I think there was just sort of this cocoon that felt innocent and felt un-impactful yet, that innocence and that cocoon really has a great impact on the people in the community when you don t understand where they re coming from.  And I think that s the part that most people don t understand is that that sort of either willful or--well, ignorance I guess for lack of a better word on whether willful or not, is really impactful in the Black community because they re hurting.  You know, their pain is not being seen.  That s what I really experienced in talking to the community. CH:Well, James Baldwin says that, you know, what Whites do is confuse ignorance for innocence.  And that the longer that ignorance continues, the more people become monsters, to paraphrase Baldwin.  Let s talk a little bit about what happens in a city like Ferguson, St. Louis County, because it s not just indiscriminate and often lethal police violence.  But it s completely predatory.  It s about--I think there s a quote in the film from someone who says if they see a cop, it s you--it s not only that their life is in jeopardy but they assume they re going to be robbed.  And there is a huge economic aspect to the oppression that is visited on African-Americans not only in Ferguson but in most poor urban areas.  Can you explain that? MO:Yeah, I mean in Ferguson, clearly like many poor areas across the country, there was a heavy practice of ticketing and then those tickets would eventually turn into warrants because people were not able to pay them.  And because, I mean, you know, the municipalities in St. Louis were so close together, what often happened is people would get the same ticket over and over again in different municipalities and on their way driving to work, on their way driving back, and so they would build up so many tickets and so many warrants that actually had been many times in which people actually committed suicide because they just could not get out from underneath this debt and they just could not see any other way out, unfortunately other than to commit suicide or to do something really desperate.  And that s how bad it really got, was that it became a debtor s prison in many of these communities across St. Louis.  And across the country I think it s still going on, it s just it got exposed in St. Louis. CH:Well, we should be clear that these are--people are being pulled over for a burned-out taillight.  We re not talking about crimes and many, you know cases, invented crimes, because 30% of the revenue in St. Louis County, they ll write it in to the budget every year, comes from revenues.  So you can get arrested for mowing your lawn, not mowing your lawn, obstructing pedestrian traffic which means standing on a sidewalk.  It s just an endless litany… MO:Yeah, men who s walking in the road. CH:Yeah.  Well, this is--let s talk about the killing of Michael Brown because that began with that particular issue. MO:So as I understand it, I mean he and his friend were walking down the middle of the street.  If you ve ever been to Canfield Green Apartments, you know that the sidewalks are so tiny and that the road is blocked on one end.  And it s pretty much--it s not a major road by any stretch of the imagination, so there s no real danger in the sense that there s no one really driving on that street for the most part during the daytime.  And again, the sidewalks are really tiny so they re walking in the middle of the street so they can actually talk side by side as men do.  Usually they re walking talking to each other.  But that s impossible if you walk on the sidewalk so you have to walk in the street.  So, they were sort of forced by the structure of the environment to walk in the middle of the street, and then the police officer came by and told them to get out of the street is what--is how they describe it, but in less nice terms than that.  And then that s when the altercation began that led to Michael Brown s death.  Of course, none of us was really there to witness exactly what happened so we can t say for sure.  But the assumption is that basically there was a confrontation between the two of them and ironically enough, in talking to the parents, Michael Brown had been harassed by Darren Wilson before on many occasions so I think there were some sort of animosity there already that he generally had for either Michael Brown or the Black citizens of Ferguson in general who had also been harassed by him as well.  So there was something that took place that eventually led to--led to his death but it s--in talking to all the police officers and other folks who are in that area, that is not standard practice to get out of your car and pursue a suspect and shoot them--shoot them down.  If the issue is really that serious you back away and they fall a--they fall away from the car, you back away and then you call for backup.  And you get out of there, so the idea that it escalated to that extent, even police officers were baffled that I talked to as well. CH:And that was it.  That kind of set this kindling which had long been building in Ferguson as it has in other cities afire.  And how did the community respond?  Which you spend a lot of time in the film documenting. MO:How did the community respond?  I mean, I--it s--it varied.  I think many people were shocked, even though, you know, many of the White citizens were shocked because I mean, Ferguson is a small enough town that it s rare when that someone actually gets killed with any high level of frequency.  So for this to happen I think was really shocking for many of the town members and many of the community members.  And even some of the folks that lived in Canfield Green because they had to see the body on the ground for four and a half hours uncovered for the vast majority of that time, walking home with their children.  So it was very traumatizing for their children, very traumatizing for them to see this and to--and to have it handled in the way it was handled without covering the body, without taking the body away, I think really built up tensions and animosity in the community, that with the heavy ticketing practices, with the harassment, and the things that were going on, it was sort of this powder keg waiting to--waiting to erupt.  And this really sort of pushes everybody over the edge. CH:Did you ever find out why?  Did the police ever explain why they left the body unattended, uncovered for that length of time in the street? MO:Some of the police officers that I spoke to were from St. Louis in general.  They weren t from the Ferguson area because the Ferguson Police Department was not allowed to speak to me at that time.  But they were just estimating that they just hadn t really encountered this problem before and they were trying to figure out the best way to deal with the crime scene.  I find that a little hard to believe that even if you hadn t encountered before that you couldn t cover the body, that somehow that that would tamper with the--with the crime scene I m not sure, but that s what they said that they were--they probably were just confused and didn t really know how to--how to handle the scene.  You know, it s--you know, it s not for me to say that whether or not that was true or not but it just doesn t--it doesn t seem realistic to me.  But, you know, that--that s what they told me. CH:And then you have the buildup towards the verdict on the police officer.  I found that moment really quite amazing in the film because number one they choose to announce at night when potentially you re going to have far more problems.  But also this long, I think it was 40 minutes.  But just explain that process and then what happened. MO:I mean it just--I guess for many people they wanted to hear the verdict and they didn t want to hear sort of the complaints about the media, the bloggers, all those other things.  But he had this walk--well for one I think McCullough who was--who was prosecuting Darren Wilson had this long history and connection to the police department himself, with his father being a former police officer killed by an African-American.  You know, so there was a lot of sort of connection that he had to it, which is why people wanted him to recuse himself from the--from the case because of his connections to the police department, his also supporting and funding, helping fund the police department as well with their union.  And so his then going on and speaking for 45 minutes making the announcement at night seemed like it was a perfect sort of setup to bring in and marshall the forces, and have--and have everything turn into something that then would make the community itself look like they were the real enemy of the state.  And I think in in that way, we… CH:Okay.  We re going to--we re going to take a break. MO:Oh, sure.  Sure. CH:We re going to take a break.  When we come back we ll continue our discussion with Director Mobolaji Olambiwonnu.  Welcome back to On Contact.  We continue our discussion with the director of Ferguson Rises, Mobo--Molobaji Olambiwonnu. MALE:Mobalaji. CH:There, you got it.  Thanks.  So let s talk a little bit about the reaction, you know, what happened afterwards, and not just the eruption, but what it spawned, which you document in your film. MO:You mean in terms of what happened--the ripple effects that happened in the community?  I mean certainly… CH:Once the police officer was--the prosecutor decide not to charge the police officer, Darren Wilson? MO:Yeah.  I mean, we know from what we saw on the news  that obviously that there were outbreaks of violence and a reaction to, you know, protests and things of that sort, in reaction to the verdict, and to Darren Wilson not being convicted, so we do know that part from the news. I think what we don t know is that the vast majority of the protests were actually non-violent, the vast majority of the protests were peaceful, and that they went on for more than a year after the verdict happened, and that the community really rallied together to make sure that their voices were heard and they made sure they were out in the street consistently for at least a year.  And that was a huge record for [INDISTINCT] in terms of civil rights protests, that was something that really hadn t happened in a large sense until Selma--I mean since Selma.  And so this was huge for the United States, before even George Floyd, before everything that s going on now, this was the--was the earlier onset of sort of protests that really led to that level of militancy and that level of commitment to justice that we now see with George Floyd.  So this is the [INDISTINCT] and the birth of that sort of… CH:Well, it became--it became the template, didn t it?  For the Floyd protests, Breonna Taylor, and others? MO:It did.  And most importantly, it gave life to the blacklivesmatter movement which began after Trayvon Martin, but really didn t pick up steam until Ferguson, until everything that happened, that hashtag started trending and became sort of Twitter s number one ever used hashtag.  So clearly, that was really the birthplace, in a way, of the blacklivesmatter movement, which now has gotten a stronghold in the movement in general against police brutality and for justice for Black people across America.  So it was--it was really--Ferguson was really the birthplace, the Selma of our times, and the birthplace of so many things including the use of also body cams for police officers came right after on the heels of that, and so we see many things that happened on the heels of that that led us to our current point with George Floyd, where we actually saw the body cam footage with George Floyd.  Had it not been for what happened in Ferguson and the use of body cams, the implementation of body cams, we wouldn t have been able to see some of that footage that we saw today with regards to George Floyd, so a lot happened and jumped off in Ferguson that led to where we are today. CH:There were two points in the film that interested me quite a bit.  One is you focused on clergy, religious leaders, Sekou, there was a White woman minister whose name I forgot, of course, Cornel West makes a brief appearance in the film.  You push that kind of religious underpinning.  And the second thing that I thought was interesting was what I found to be the political sophistication that these protesters in the streets were not going to be gaslighted with a Kamala Harris, that they had a real understanding that these were systemic problems that wouldn t be changed with, you know, diversity within the political structure.  Can you talk about those two points? MO:Well, in terms of the use of the clergy that participated in it, I saw on the streets that the people who were really doing the work were the clergy.  I mean, not to say that the locals who were not clergy were not doing the work as well, but I was really actually surprised and stunned at the involvement of clergy because I m used to seeing protesters, but I m not used to seeing as much clergy as I did in Ferguson.  And the clergy that I saw were really radical, were really pushing for justice in a way that I really--that we really don t see or clergy do.  Or we don t really understand clergy to be participating in the--in the struggle for justice in that way.  And so I wanted to highlight the fact that clergy does play or clergy do play a role in justice movements all across the world, and in particular, in Ferguson, and they had a tremendous impact on the ground there as well.  So I wanted to make sure I highlighted that fact. CH:Just talk a little bit about, you know, what their understanding of power was and how to respond to it. MO:I mean, what I found most interesting, and you tell me if I m answering your question, is I found most interesting that they were utilizing the Bible and they were utilizing the verses from scripture in a much more radical way than we re used to being utilized on the right.  We think of clergy as being conservative and these folks were far from that, they were utilizing the Bible and the scripture as a political--as a political text and a spiritual text to really push forth an agenda that was much more egalitarian, and that much more resembles, I think, what the Bible--what I believe the Bible is trying to say and so I love that about them, is they really sort of, for me, redefined the clergy as much more relevant in a political, and a cultural, and a social movement context than I had really thought of them prior. CH:I want to talk a little bit about the response to the elites the--including the traditional Black leadership that Jesse Jackson who was booed in Ferguson, Al Sharpton was booed in Ferguson.  I believe Michael Eric Dyson was booed in Ferguson.  Explain what s happening there. MO:There s a deep irreverence, you know, for the old guard, which, in some ways, I would say--and for people that they don t know, that they haven t seen actively on the ground participating in the movement, they feel like people come in, they speak, they fly in, they fly out, they make a press conference, and they don t really--they re not really doing the work on the ground is the sense I got from people.  So they were very apprehensive about my being there, they re apprehensive about anybody being there that hadn t had a history of being on the ground in Ferguson and hadn t had the--hadn t shown that they were really connected to the movement on the ground, so--and I understand that and I appreciate that because I felt like what we saw there was an authentic grassroots movement that wasn t really top-down but was really bottom-up.  So we saw kids who were discovering the political process, one of the guys in the film is--was an ex-football coach, part-time football coach.  So this was the birthing of this sort of political awareness and for many people, that s what made this movement so powerful, is that they didn t have the sort of entanglements of the past that really held them into a--into a strict way of acting, and a strict way of responding to police.  They were rediscovering things and discovering new things that I think past movements had not discovered, particularly with the aid of technology, Twitter, Facebook, and those other things, they were really utilizing things in a--in a much more powerful--a much more--much more successful way than I think previous civil rights leaders would ve done anyway. CH:I remember speaking to one of the activists, T-Dubb-O, and he was invited to The White House by Obama after Michael Brown s killing, and he told me that Obama asked him if he had voted for Obama and he said, ""No, I haven t voted for you because you haven t done anything for Black people.""  And I got a sense from your film that the old kind of way that in systemic racism has been dealt with, and Biden just illustrated this, are just not working among--especially these young new militants.  Would you agree? MO:Yeah.  No doubt.  I mean, I think, again, that irreverence goes across the board so it s not--it s not only particular to Obama, it s--to me, it s to anybody who comes from the outside.  So you have to build that trust, and you have to build those relationships, and it s not just a given that you re going to get those votes, you re going to get those relationships, you re going to have to earn those.  And I think that s the new, young Black America which I appreciate, is that these folks really want to see some change and they want to see people actually doing the work before they just automatically give them their respect and their vote.  And that goes for everybody, I don t--and I think that s great, it s an even way of dealing with folks that really ask for you to do the work on the ground first. CH:You spend, at the end of the film, quite a bit of time focusing on, I guess, for lack of a better phrase, personal transformation among those who carry out these protests.  Speak about that what.  What you were trying to say, what you saw happening within them? MO:I think what was great about what I saw in Ferguson was that--was that people were developing a greater sense of purpose through being involved in the movement.  They were getting a sense of their personal power, they were getting a sense of purpose, and they were--and they were getting a greater sense of being able to shape their future and their reality.  Even people who had been involved in protests before were finding a new sense of freedom, like Reverend Sekou, we talked about as well, finding a new sense of freedom that, you know, in the church, he felt restrained, whereas on the streets, he felt like he was able to fully enact what he believed to be the biblical principles which is fighting for those who are the least among us.  And so we saw that with him, and we saw that with Torrey Russell, for example, who was a part-time football coach who became an activist and then now all of a sudden, he was this sort of national figure, that became that national figure as a result of being--participating on the ground and developing and finding his own voice, making those mistakes.  So what we saw was-- we saw quite a--quite a few mistakes being made in terms of how things were handled, but that s all part of sort of the growing process that occurred on the ground.  So we saw a lot of organic organizing and a lot of organic community building that to me was just very inspiring, despite all the challenges since then and during that time, it was very inspiring for me to see these people develop their voices and [INDISTINCT] focus of what just the negativity of what was happening with the police to the positivity that was happening within their communities.  People were, you know, developing new communal ways of handling problems and dealing with one another that didn t exist prior.  So we saw a lot of growth in those communities despite the lack of change on the judicial side of things. CH:Well, I don t think it would be pushing too far to say, at least I got this from the film, that that solidarity, that organizing, that act of resistance itself was a form of healing.  I--that was the message I took away. MO:Yeah.  Yes.  Indeed.  I mean, I think the whole idea is that--I mean, the whole idea of my intention in making this film was really to demonstrate that the healing and the freedom comes from standing up, you know.  We don t--we can t--we don t have control over the laws, we don t have controls of the people in power per se, but we do have control over ourselves and our ability to stand up, and to speak up, and that that freedom comes from that.  And I saw the faces of people, and I got a sense that they were really experiencing a level of freedom they had never experienced before in their lives, despite the fear, despite the terror of tear gas and rubber bullets, et cetera, they were experiencing freedom that needs to be recognized and acknowledged, when you stand up, you re free. CH:Great.  Thank you.  That was the director of Ferguson Rises, Mobolaji Olambiwonnu, speaking to me from California.  Thank you. MO:Thank you very much.

"19 Sep, 2020",Police arrest 11 as wildfires clear and rioting resumes in Portland (VIDEOS),"After wildfires caused a rare break in rioting, demonstrators in Portland resumed their nighttime activities, this time targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. They were swiftly pushed back by police. Portland has been a hive of unrest since the death of George Floyd earlier this summer, with demonstrations only pausing when wildfires encroached on the city over the last week. However, the blaze receded and smoke cleared on Friday, prompting activists to march on the ICE building at nightfall. Front line at the ICE facility Portland OR#PortlandProtestspic.twitter.com/x4TPWObbTm The crowd was met by police and federal agents, who say they were pelted with projectiles. Federal agents first pushed the demonstrators back from the ICE building, before the Portland Police Bureau declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and swooped in to arrest anyone refusing to disperse. Dramatic footage shared on social media shows agents tackling rioters to the ground. Though an edict from Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler forbids the city’s police from using tear gas, the streets were filled with what looked like smoke and gas, possibly deployed by federal agents. Some reports on social media suggested that tear gas was used by police.

"19 Sep, 2020","African Americans want black national anthem and black-only towns, but that s borrowing from the white supremacist playbook","Under the pretense of ‘systemic racism’, black racial justice groups in the United States are advocating on behalf of radical measures that threaten to tear apart the colorful fabric of the diverse nation forever. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Just before his untimely death in 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King summed up the reality of the United States when he said,“We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.”The message was unmistakable: in order for the world’s greatest experiment in democracy and multiculturalism to succeed, its people must focus on what unites them as opposed to what drives them apart. Today, however, the“same boat”that King referenced is sinking below the waves of racial strife, and not even the sports world is exempt. In fact, it was on the ‘field of dreams’ where much of the current antagonism first began. In 2016, former NFL quarterback-turned professional activist Colin Kaepernick ‘took a knee’ during the playing of the national anthem to protest police brutality. Predictably, the gesture polarized the country, even causing dedicated sports fans to change the channel. Internal NFL memo sent to address concern as to why ratings this season are so far down 11%pic.twitter.com/SitMveCr8q The real challenge, however, came with the death of George Floyd, when local and state Democratic leaders, forced to respond to ‘peaceful’ street protests, found it more politically expedient to genuflect on behalf of the blacklivesmatter s movement than to put an end to the violence. Since then, the demands on behalf of activist groups have not gone away; indeed, they have become ever more radicalized. This week, the National Football League – where some 70 percent of players are black, by the way –kicked offthe 2020 season by playing a rendition of the ‘black national anthem’, entitled ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’. Needless to say, not a single player on the field was caught kneeling as that song rang out through a mostly-empty, pandemic-stricken stadium. Minutes later, however, dozens of players kneeled for the playing of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’, written by Francis Scott Key to commemorate the American flag during the War of 1812. The question of national allegiance notwithstanding, does America really need two national anthems? After all, that would only fuel the dangerous notion that there are two separate ‘nations’ with two separate peoples inside of one country. At the same time, who is going to break the news to America’s large Latino population, for example, or the Asian one, that they can’t have their own national anthems played at sporting events, too? Although there are solid grounds for arguing (as my colleague Chris Sweeney hasproposedon these pages) that the beloved ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ could do with a modern makeover in light of some of its racist overtones, should we really toss out the baby with the dirty bath water? Americans have already witnessed the removal of hundreds of statues of historical figures who had some connection to slavery and the oppression of minorities (and even some who do not); does the country really need to start trashing its oral and written record as well? That is a slippery slope that could lead to national disintegration. The iconic Teddy Roosevelt statue in front of the Museum of Natural History on the west side of Central Park being removed. As a New Yorker and a museum nerd this one hurts. 😔pic.twitter.com/StwBn9tfGk The very essence of this debate, however, ignores a crucial historical fact: although Americans are certainly guilty of many odious crimes against humanity, with slavery topping the list, few people have sacrificed more to correct those wrongs than the Americans themselves. The most obvious example is the Civil War (1861-1865), which was at least partially fought to end the institution of slavery and prevent the Confederate states from seceding from the Union. It is estimated that up to one million Americans lost their lives in that conflict. Yet today, with no loss of irony, some black people are attempting to ‘secede’ from the US with the goal of creating their own territory inside of the country. This week it was reported that 19 families purchased 100 acres of land in Georgia to create a“safe haven”for black families. “It s about a safe haven. It s about having a place where you can be authentically black, unapologetically black and not be judged,”Ashley Scott, one of the new residents of Liberty, Georgia,toldlocal media.“Our 96 acres is to [serve as a] safe haven for … retreats, and reunions and weddings, trails for hunting, a lake for fishing and a place for us to just breathe.” One of the main problems with that project, of course, is its glaring hypocrisy. After all, whenever white Americans have attempted in the past to create such ‘safe places’, the kneejerk reaction was to condemn them as ‘white supremacists’ and knuckle-dragging xenophobes. The other contradiction is that the creation of walled-off, race-based communities is fundamentally anti-American to the core. Black Americans seeking their own fenced-off land is no better than the white segregationist ‘back of the bus’ policies that led to the ferocious civil rights battles of the 1960s. In other words, African Americans are wandering down the same dark alley that their white brothers did decades ago, and if they think the results will somehow turn out better for them this time around they are sadly mistaken. The way to cure racism in the United States is not by each racial group seeking shelter behind their own fortifications, behind their own anthems, behind their own flags, but rather for Americans to rally around the“solid rock of brotherhood,”to quote King once again. It is truly the only way forward. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/501080-african-americans-black-anthem/
"19 Sep, 2020",Journalism student at ASU’s Cronkite school CANCELED for tweeting about Jacob Blake warrant,"A journalism student at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School has been fired from her job as manager of the school-run radio station because of her tweet about black man Jacob Blake, shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rae’Lee Klein, who had been pressured to resign by administrators and the student board of directors at Arizona State’s Blaze Radio station, said Thursday that she had officially been removed from her position as manager. She said school officials, including interim dean Kristin Gilger, declined to tell her what rule or rules she had violated. UPDATE: The Cronkite school has officially removed me from my position as Station Manger, despite refusal to inform me of what university/Cronkite rules I violated. Check out the article for the full details. As they know, this is far from over...https://t.co/sp9AvUrV72 The controversy began when Klein retweeted an article from the New York Post about Blake’s arrest warrant on August 28. The warrant included details about allegations of felony sexual assault against Blake, and Klein added a comment to her retweet saying,“Always more to the story, folks. Please read the article to get the background of Jacob Blake’s warrant. You’ll be quite disgusted.” Klein later said in an interview that she was disgusted by the accusations against Blake, which included an alleged violent sexual assault of a woman in front of the woman’s child. But at the time of her tweet, Blake had become the inspiration for violent blacklivesmatter protests in Kenosha after police shot him seven times in the back during a struggle to arrest him. A few days after the tweet, the six-member board of directors at Blaze Radio voted unanimously to call for Klein’s resignation and said it wouldn’t recognize her as manager if she refused. Former student directors of the station issued a statement in support of the decision, saying“students of color will not feel welcome”at the station as long as Klein remains manager. pic.twitter.com/5fcokgzQJr The Cronkite Schoolissueda statement Friday, denying that Klein had been fired from her position.“Any actions that are unfolding are not punishment for a tweet,”Gilger said in the statement.“I have been clear with Rae’Lee that she would not be removed as station manager… because of the views she expressed.” But Klein’s Tweet Thursday included a screenshot of an email from Gilger, reminding her that“staying on as station manager is not an option.”The message was a response to Klein’s refusal of an earlier ultimatum to accept one of three options – being reassigned to another student job, remaining on the board in another capacity, or starting her own radio station. Gilger’s statement Friday said she had offered the student“numerous ways to resolve the situation that take into account the needs of all students involved in the Blaze Radio organization.” Ironically, Gilger is interim dean because ‘cancel culture’ at Arizona Statebroughtdown her predecessor. Sonya Duhe, who was set to become the school’s dean, triggered student and faculty outrage when she posted a tweet in June saying she was praying for the family of George Floyd and“the good police officers who keep us safe.”Former students stepped forward to accuse Duhe of“microaggressions,”and the Cronkite School rescinded its offer to her. After publishing a Q&A article in June in which a student interviewed a former police officer, students complained again. The school removed the article from the internet and replaced it with an apology note. The school is named for the late Walter Cronkite, who was called“the most trusted man in America”during his tenure as anchorman of CBS Evening News from 1962 to 1981. Twitter users, including author Chris DeRose,saidit may be time to remove Cronkite’s name from the school, in light of the decision to fire a journalist for reporting truthful information.“Walter is rolling over in his grave at what journalism has become,”one commenter said. Conservative author Mike Cernovichquestionedwhether federal funding to Arizona State could be halted. Walter is rolling over in his grave at what journalism has become. Other Twitter usersencouragedKlein to sue the university, and some said they were Arizona State alumni and would stop their donations to the school. Many commentersencouragedKlein to keep fighting for truth, saying her career will be boosted by her ouster from Blaze Radio, but onesaid,“Unfortunately, it’s journalism today. There’s no longer journalism. There’s only peddlers of activism.” Wow as an ASU alum, I find this disgusting and abhorrent that they removed you simply for providing a retweet of factual evidence/real news regardless of it being counter to their clearly liberal and biased bs narrative. I will not give another cent to ASU and that hurts to say. Now you became a real journalist - with a national profile - good fortune masquerading as adversity! Keep fighting! Oh and I am sure there are some lawyers who would be interested in your situation. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/501119-student-canceled-tweet-blake/
"18 Sep, 2020",Liberal rage over Kyle Rittenhouse’s inclusion on assignment about ‘heroes’ will teach schools to ban independent thought,"The outpouring of rage over the inclusion of Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse in a Dallas teacher’s assignment on historical figures that also included victim Joseph Rosenbaum proves the real problem is with critical thinking. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram A Dallas high school English teacher handed students an assignment titled ‘Hero for the Modern Age’ that asked them to write up half-page biographies of beloved historical figures as diverse as Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X, and Cesar Chavez – as well as more contemporary (and controversial) figures Rittenhouse, Rosenbaum, and Minneapolis police brutality casualty George Floyd himself. They were also told to select one of the names and write about how they fulfilled the student’s definition of a hero. Under normal circumstances, one might expect people to take issue with the inclusion of Rosenbaum, a convicted sex offender whose last words werereportedly(and repeatedly) “Shoot me, n***a!” or even Floyd, who allegedly held a gun to a pregnant black woman’s stomach in the course of burglarizing her home years ago. But given current trends in secondhand outrage, and the posthumous canonization of Floyd as patron saint of blacklivesmatter , it was the inclusion of Rittenhouse – the 17-year-old gunman who shot Rosenbaum and two others in Kenosha during that city’s riots – who actually triggered the calls for the teacher’s cancellation. Dubbed a “white supremacist” and charged with first-degree murder, even after it emerged that one of the men he shot was actually pointing a gun at him, Rittenhouse has become a liberal bogeyman beyond his tender years. A Dallas activist exposed teacher Paul Ford as being behind the assignment on Twitter, throwing his career into jeopardy by publicizing his “APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE” [caps in original] essay prompt. CNN claimed to have spoken to an actual student at the school, one Kristian, who was reportedly shocked by the (admittedly bewildering) misspelling of “Malcom [sic] X” and the lack of female options for the “hero” essay that her brother had been assigned. “The fact that a white supremacist murderer’s name is on a list with important historical figures” was what “very ardently” set Kristian off, according to the cable news outlet. It’s not clear what made Rosenbaum or Floyd “important historical figures” while Rittenhouse wasn’t, but the contemporary trio’s presence next to the better-known historical figures might have given more open-minded students a new perspective on current events. Paul Ford is an English teacher at@WTWHighSchoolin#DallasISD This is an actual assignment - giving students an opportunity to write an essay about how#Kenoshamurderer Kyle Rittenhouse is a ""hero."" APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE.pic.twitter.com/CB7jY1A7pu Such a thing is verboten in 21st century child-rearing, which centers on ensuring kids are raised with the “right” ideas. The backlash to the Dallas teacher’s unorthodox assignment was for all intents and purposes a left-wing mirror image of the pearl-clutching conservative parents who’d freaked out over a cartoon handed out by a Westchester, New York teacher earlier this month that compared police officers to the KKK. While the cartoon was enough to upset any pro-cop parent, the assignment that accompanied it – which essentially bullied kids into swearing fealty to blacklivesmatter – should have been a bigger deal. If anything, the Texas schoolteacher’s assignment left a wider range of opinions open to students than his New York counterpart, as the teacher made it clear the finished paper would only be graded on spelling, grammar, “clarity,” and completeness (whether they’d followed the instructions requesting five paragraphs or more). Nowhere did the teacher suggest one of the names was more heroic than the others. But neither the angry Westchester parents nor their incensed peers in Dallas seemed capable of understanding that encouraging their kids to think outside their comfort zone might actually be beneficial in creating a world where there are no Rittenhouses or cops=KKK cartoons. American parents have been trained to expect obedient children – and to deem their kids defective when they ask too many questions – but not to dig deeper and seriously contemplate what a world full of independently-thinking young people might bring in terms of benefits. Whereas 2020’s blacklivesmatter protest crowds have essentially been at the mercy of the person with the loudest voice – whether they demand the rest shout slogans endlessly or raid the nearest Target – a group of youngsters capable of independent thought would not be so easily led astray. As if mainstream media’s condemnation of the teacher who foolishly expected some independent thought from his students wasn’t bad enough, the school district actually went along with the public shaming. They profusely apologized for the assignment, claiming it had not been “approved” and removing it from prostrating themselves before the diversity gods, declaring “racial equity is a top priority in Dallas ISD” and bloviating about their commitment to “be culturally sensitive to our diverse populations” – though an untrained eye might say the teacher’s list of potential heroes had been very diverse indeed, what with an Indian, two black men, and one Hispanic alongside the two white men. Promoting diversity and independent thought, in one assignment?! No teacher will make that mistake again – much to the detriment of their students.

"17 Sep, 2020",Princeton president s letter decrying racism of institution BACKFIRES as Dept of Education announces investigation of university,"The Department of Education has announced it will investigate Princeton University after President Christopher Eisgruber wrote a letter decrying his school s ""racism"" and the US s ""anti-blackness."" A formal records request has been sent to the university to make sure they are not using racist practices and violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says that no person“on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" If found guilty of any misdoings, the university could therefore lose millions in funds they receive from the federal government. The investigation was sparked after Eisgruber addressed the divisive blacklivesmatter protests raging across the US in a letter earlier this month. The letter acknowledged the“anti-black racism in America”that led to the deaths of people like Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, with Eisgruber saying it has a direct effect on the university. ""Racism and the damage it does to people of color persist at Princeton,” he continued, adding that “racist assumptions”are“embedded in the structures of the university itself.”In hisletter, Eisguiber promised a series of policy changes, including efforts to create diversity quotas for students and faculty. In the Department of Education’s letter to the school, which wasobtainedby The Washington Examiner, they say it is the“admitted racism”in Eisgruber’s letter that has spurred the investigation. ""Based on its admitted racism, the US Department of Education is concerned Princeton’s nondiscrimination and equal opportunity assurances in its Program Participation Agreements from at least 2013 to the present may have been false,""the letter reads. The department demanded all records related to the university president’s letter and a""spreadsheet identifying each person who has, on the ground of race, color, or national origin”been discriminated against at the university. The fact that Eisgruber’s woke letter — which was celebrated by many BLM supporters at the time of its release — is now backfiring spectacularly on him, with potential legal consequences, has some conservatives celebrating on social media. “This is absolutely delicious,”reporter Bari Weisstweeted. “Wouldn’t it be amazing if we got to shutter the universities based on their own declarations of their alleged ‘systemic racism?’”author Dave Reaboitweeted. Princeton’s obvious next step is to assert to the federal government that it isn’t racist while reassuring students and faculty that it is.

"16 Sep, 2020","George Floyd riots cost insurance companies as much as $2 BILLION - more than any in HISTORY, industry claims","The property destruction from the riots that followed Minneapolis police’s killing of George Floyd was the worst in the history of insurance, with claims costing insurers up to $2 billion, according to an industry group’s report. The tidal wave of arson, vandalism, and other property crimes that swept across the nation in the aftermath of the Floyd killing left between $1 billion and $2 billion in damages, as measured by insurance claims paid out by the industry, areportreleased Wednesday by the Insurance Information Institute (III) has revealed. While that figure represents only the damage done between May 26 and June 8 - meaning the real figure taking into account the destruction in cities like Portland and Kenosha is likely much higher - it still represents the worst riot damage in insurance industry history, according to the report. Previously, only natural disasters like hurricanes and floods had resulted in over $1 billion in damage claims. The sheer scale of the destruction - spread across 140 American cities and lasting for weeks - helped push this year’s riots well past the $775 million damage record previously set in Los Angeles in 1992, following the acquittal of the police officers who beat up and permanently crippled Rodney King. Both victims were black and had criminal records, but the parallels largely end there. In King’s case, the four officers who beat him to within an inch of his life before being acquitted of assault and excessive force were white, while 17 other cops supposedly stood by and watched - and were never indicted. In Floyd’s case, all four officers present have been charged - and the rioters didn’t wait until a verdict to start laying waste to their cities. The Floyd riots were the first time since 1992 that a so-called“civil disorder event”has been classified as a“catastrophe”- a real insurance category, representing anything causing over $25 million in insured losses - according to Property Claim Services, which tracks such claims. This year’s riots also represent the first civil disorder catastrophe to unfold across multiple cities. While unrest continues in some cities, much of the rioting has died down - for now. Insurance companies are bracing for a flare-up in the wake of November’s election, PCS head Tom Johansmeyer told Axios on Wednesday.“There could be riots that lead to significant losses that would meet our reporting thresholds”for catastrophe, he said. Several US intelligence agencies, think tanks, military contractors, and even tech companies have also run election simulations in which contested results lead to widespread civil unrest, including rioting. While it’s unlikely any burned-out business feels fortunate to have to file an insurance claim, those destroyed in the riots are in a better situation than their colleagues driven out of business by the coronavirus pandemic. Despite causing what may be the worst recession in US history, Covid-19-related economic shutdowns are not covered by normal insurance policies.

"14 Sep, 2020",Diversity of thought much? University of Chicago English program accepts applicants ONLY if they seek to work in ‘black studies’,"The prestigious University of Chicago is willing to accept just one train of thought in its English department – “black studies,” as only graduate students who have a keen interest in that topic are being considered for admission. The strict guideline is made clear on the department’s website, where a faculty statement endorsed blacklivesmatter and said:“We are committed to the struggle of black and indigenous people, and allracialized and dispossessedpeople, against inequality and brutality.” The faculty added:“English as a discipline has a long history of providing aesthetic rationalizations for colonization, exploitation, extraction and anti-blackness.”To help undo“persistent, recalcitrant anti-blackness in our discipline,”the department has increased hiring and admission of non-white scholars“in the study of the global contours of anti-blackness and in the equally global project of black freedom.” Coursesoffered in the current school year include“Black Shakespeare,”“Uneasy Intimacies: Interracial Modernism,”and a course on two of the late Toni Morrison’s novels. The university has more than its share of social justice programs – including aSchool of Social AdministrationandCenter for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture– so requiring an emphasis on skin color in the study of literature left some observersgobsmacked. One Twitter user asked:“Whatever happened todiversity of thought?”Another said:“The adults are no longerin the room,”while one commenter said the department should be defunded and the universitypunished by alumni. Human rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali mockingly suggested that if the university is committed to black studies, perhaps it should replace the teaching of“racist, colonial and deplorable”English with African languages, such as Swahili and Fulani. I just tweeted an article about the University of Chicago English Department. This is all too idiotic. Most of us don t know whether to laugh or cry. By the logic of their creed, wouldn t English be the oppressor s language? The leftist bent of college faculties around the US is nothing new, but issues of skin color are getting even more emphasis on campus this year amid the BLM protest movement. For instance, the University of Rhode Island said it will replace the murals that have adorned its Memorial Union building since its opening in 1954 because they depict too many white people and lack“sensitivity”in the age of George Floyd protests.

"14 Sep, 2020",Protests over the shooting of a crazed knifeman who charged at cops prove BLM and Antifa just want to watch America burn,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is the latest US city hit by mass unrest following a police shooting. Bodycam footage shows the cops were entirely justified, but the protesters don’t care about facts – they just want to cause trouble. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Has anyone noticed that blacklivesmatter s’ chosen martyrs seem to be getting harder to have sympathy for? They began withBreonna Taylor, a woman who was caught in the crossfire by police after a shootout ensued between cops who raided her apartment, searching for drugs, and her boyfriend. According to reports, officers from the police department in Louisville, Kentucky, fired over 20 shots, eight of which struck the blameless Taylor, who died at the scene. Taylor was an emergency medical technician who died tragically in what was clearly an accident. Upset over her death in March of this year was understandable. Then, in May, we had the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which served as the lightning rod for global demonstrations. After footage went viral of Floyd yelling that he couldn’t breathe as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck until he died, protests erupted across America and the world, and haven’t stopped since. His death initially seemed a clear-cut case of police brutality and excessive force. He didn’t appear to be resisting in the first video clip that went viral, and it sparked international condemnation. It later transpired that Floyd had acocktail of drugsin his system that would have made Keith Richards blush, and had actually refused to get into the patrol car after numerous requests from the arresting officers. An autopsy found that he died from a cardiac arrest that these narcotics may well have contributed to, and not from asphyxiation, although his family dispute this. It also transpired that Floyd was a career criminal who’d been in and out of prison for much of his life, and had, at one point, threatened a pregnant woman with a gun during a robbery. No one would argue he deserved his fate, but the case was more complicated than it initially appeared, and protestations that a 46-year-old man on fentanyl and cocaine was turning his life around seem unlikely to say the least. Regardless of his past failings, he should not have died in the manner he did. Then we moved on toJacob Blake, who didn’t die in his encounter with the cops in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but has been left paralysed from the waist down after being shot. However, to the unbiased observer, the video of this incident seemed to show this wasn’t a case of an unjustified shooting. In the footage, which again sparked protests, Blake was seen walking around his car while officers had guns trained on him. He then proceeded to open the driver’s side front door and reach into the footwell, at which point, the arresting officer shot him in the back seven times. I’m not an American, but even I know that reaching into the footwell of your car while a US policeman has a gun pointed at you is a surefire way to get filled with lead. It later transpired that the police had been responding to a domestic violence complaint against Blake, who had an open warrant for sexual assault against his name. The police had already tasered him, but he’d got up again and walked to his car and was reaching for a knife in the footwell. Since Blake’s children were in the car, this story was spun as ‘evil cops shoot black father in front of his kids’, when, in reality, it ‘was alleged sex criminal shot reaching for weapon’. But no matter, the riots started again,NBA players threatened to go on strike, and it was held up as a further indictment of white supremacy in America. Never let facts get in the way of a good narrative. However, the latest case really takes the cake. There is currently unrest in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, after the police shot a man who was charging at them with a weapon. Officers had been called to a domestic disturbance, when knife-wielding Ricardo Munoz ran at them, brandishing the blade, and was clearly about to try to stab them. Bodycam footage shows Munoz jumping at an officer with the knife raised, and then being shot and killed. Following news of the shooting, hundreds of people took to the streets of Lancaster and the inevitable protests began. Misinformation was spread wildly on social media, with some people apparently believing the 27-year-old Munoz was an autistic 14-year-old who had been shot by the police. Munoz is also in the process of having his race revised from Latino to black to better suit the narrative. Protester outside#LancasterPApolice station still believes that victim of police involved shooting was 14 years old and not 28, despite reports claiming otherwise. At least they are now admitting that he did have a knife.#LancasterProtestpic.twitter.com/Lv7yoz2iaV Lancaster, PA: police summarily executed a reportedly autistic man they claim was armed with a knifeThey left his dead body ""visible on the ground for more than two hours""Protests are amping up in real-time...13 September 2020 PMhttps://t.co/klOKdjNQUL Police killed an Autistic boy in Lancaster PA What do these protesters want? It’s one thing to criticise police for racial profiling or excessive force when a perpetrator isn’t resisting arrest, but to argue that officers aren’t justified in using lethal force when a crazed knifeman is charging at them is ridiculous. Policing, particularly in a country with such a heavily armed citizenry, is a difficult and dangerous job. This doesn’t mean the police shouldn’t be held to account when they overreact or break the law. Obviously they should. But protesting such an obviously justified shooting as that of Munoz just shows that these leftist groups have no interest in real reform – they simply want to cause trouble. Their rhetoric has led to millions of dollars’ worth of damage in cities across America. The unrest caused by their rioting has resulted in multiple deaths, including those of teenagers. This latest unrest in Lancaster marks a new low for BLM and Antifa, but I no longer believe they care about winning people over to their cause. They just want to watch America burn.

"14 Sep, 2020","If I’d been the police officer being charged-at by that knife-wielding maniac in Lancaster, I’d have pulled the trigger too","A US cop justifiably shoots a threatening black man dead, but still the ‘woke’ brigade blame the police and BLM activists take to the streets. If this continues, officers will give up and then we’ll be in big trouble. Kevin Hurleyis a British politician and former police officer. He was the Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner between 2012 and 2016. He served in the Metropolitan Police, reaching the rank of Detective Chief Superintendent. He was also an officer of the Territorial Army, first in the Parachute Regiment and then the Royal Military Police. Yet again we are confronted with blacklivesmatter supporters rioting, this time in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because a lone police officer has shot a black man dead. Have you seen thevideoof the incident? I have. It shows a woman running screaming from a house followed by Ricardo Munoz, a black man, holding a large knife in his hand. The officer’s body camera records in barely two or three seconds Munoz charging at him, as the cop tries to back away rapidly, but Munoz is faster, and so the officer shoots him. In my judgement as a 30-year police veteran who’s seen and dealt with a lot of violence, the officer had no choice. A second or two later, he’d have had the knife plunged into his neck. In his position, I would have shot Munoz myself. But, once again, the video is being played out as feeding the narrative of how hard-done-by young black males are at the hands of the police in America. As if it’s another George Floyd case. The ‘woke’ media is feeding this narrative, while pusillanimous and vacillating police chiefs apologise or suspend police officers based on a few seconds of video circulating on social media, with no reference to what may have caused the officer to get out his car and become involved in a confrontation with another young black person exuding aggression, anger and violence. Surely the officer – along with many of his colleagues – must by now be thinking they would all be better off ignoring such emergency calls for help, and instead enjoy a quiet, peaceful coffee and a few donuts? Who on earth would want to be in a job where you get assaulted, surrounded, called a racist and even get suspended, or worse, for just trying to protect people? We should not be surprised that stabbings of black males are rising all the time. Maybe some readers do not care. But you would be wise to think about this phenomenon of BLM and rushing to judgement on the motives of our police officers, because many of them are giving up. No good can come of all this; unless, perhaps, you sell donuts. I want our police to do their job, prevent crime and catch criminals without fear or favour. If that means they need to stop and search a lot of young black males to reduce street violence or drug-dealing so be it. Their mothers will be grateful. The entire community, Black, Asian, White, Christian, Muslim or Agnostic, needs to get behind our police now, support them and help them if they can. That is unless you are happy to see a large man on your bus waving amacheteabout at 7am in the morning. Last week here in the UK, we were treated to the sight of hundreds of BLM demonstrators shouting and chanting outside New Scotland Yard police HQ in London’s Westminster. They did so with a reckless and selfish disregard for the need to socially distance, avoid large gatherings and stop spraying sputum potentially loaded with Covid into the air. One might have thought that since black people are apparently suffering disproportionately more deaths because of Covid they might be more sensible and responsible to stay indoors and not risk spreading the virus. Or perhaps, no matter how ludicrous, take their complaint about the virus’s “discrimination” across the river to St Thomas’s Hospital. Why not? With their “poor me” victim mentality, why not blame the NHS instead? What were they screaming about? Apparently, every time a young black male steps out of their front door in the UK they are subject to abuse, maltreatment and even death at the hands of the police. For the record, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) has reported that 16 people died in police custody last year, mainly from drug overdoses they’d given themselves. Of these, only one was black. When it comes to police use of firearms, three people were shot dead last year by police; again, only one was black. That is hardly an epidemic of police killing black males. The demonstrators had nothing to say about the nearly one hundred black people, most of whom were young males, who were murdered last year in the UK. Nor did they say anything about the epidemic of young black males being shot or stabbed, often several cases a day in London and our big cities. Could this be because in most of these incidents, the murderers and attackers are also young black males? When are we going to confront this fact and take the action needed to stem the loss of black blood? Or reduce the disproportionate numbers of young black males serving long prison sentences for causing this blood to flow? You do not get a long prison sentence for fraud; you get it for murder, extremely violent attacks, rapes or the drug-dealing of heroin, crack or cocaine, etc. When are we as society going to stop making excuses and do something to stop so many black mothers losing their sons to the undertaker or the prison system? Sadly, we will not face this issue. Instead, we expect our police and other linked organisations to go out there and deal with this problem, if they do it nicely. Well I have got news for the ‘woke’ and naïve. You cannot deal with a strong, fit, aggressive violent young male by being gentle. If you try, you will get badly hurt. In all my years in policing, I learnt that if someone is not open to reason, or is drunk, on drugs and/or has a weapon like a knife, if you don’t go in hard and fast you get hurt. That includes, if necessary, hitting them with your baton on any part of their body you can connect with, kicking, punching, choking or even forcing their head onto the floor. The few times I did not adopt this tactic, I got badly hurt. None of this looks ‘nice’ and it isn’t pleasant, but if it is your job to protect the public, including young black males stabbing each other, it has to be done, unless we want our police officers to ignore violent bullies and thugs and walk away. Street fighting is not a boxing match with rules and a referee. It is nasty, shocking, frightening, and leaves the officers involved shaken and stressed, if they are lucky, or cut or worse, if they are not. Not forgetting that they then have to go off sick and are not there to protect us the next day. As the author George Orwell reportedly said, “People sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.” Our policewomen and men of all races are not particularly rough or violent, they are decent, well educated and thoughtful people who care. They would prefer to talk their way through a problem or use persuasion. Sometimes, however, they have no choice but to be “rough.” When they are, they need to know that they will be treated fairly and not subjected to a howling media, the BLM mob or to spineless decision-making by their bosses or the police conduct office hunting their scalps. If things don’t change, the only advice I can offer you is to buy some shares in a donut shop, because, if I was still a police officer with a family to support and a mortgage, that’s where you’d likely find me.

"13 Sep, 2020","‘Pathetic, spineless, dumb’: Edinburgh University CANCELS dead genius David Hume","Edinburgh University has stripped David Hume’s name from one of its buildings, saying that the 18th century philosopher’s views on race caused “distress” to students. The university has been blasted for ‘cancelling’ a “genius.” Hume was one of the most important figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. An empiricist and student of human nature, he was a skeptic of organized religion, and his rejection of Christian miracles and the idea that the complexity of the world did not prove the existence of God made him a controversial figure in his day. Hume, however, is now the latest victim of ‘cancel culture.’ In aletterto students this weekend, Edinburgh University announced it would rename David Hume Tower as 40 George Square. The decision was made by a group of anti-racist committees, who concluded that Hume’s comments on race“rightly cause distress today.”The new name is temporary, and may become permanent after a review by the university. Prior to the renaming, studentspetitionedthe university to name the 14-storey building after Julius Nyerere, the first president of independent Tanzania and a graduate of the university. Though they decried Hume’s“racist epithets,”the effort to rename the tower after Nyerre ran into trouble when the students discovered the Tanzanian leader’s“ties to dictatorship”and“homophobia.” A testament to the insanity of our times that the University of Edinburgh takes issue with the NAME of David Hume Tower, and not the hideous structure itself.“40 George Square.” Lipstick on a pig!pic.twitter.com/k2xergZp92 On race, Hume’s views were typical of his time.“Negroes,”he wrote in a 1753 footnote to his essay ‘Of National Characters’, are“naturally inferior to the whites.”Furthermore, while Hume described slavery in 1739 as a condition that“exposes us to a thousand wants, and mortifications,”he advised his patron, Lord Hertford, in 1766 to buy a plantation in Grenada, and put up £400 of his own money toward the purchase. The links between Hume and slavery were dug up in 2014 by historian Felix Waldmann, who ironicallybenefitedfrom a Hume Fellowship at the university two years later. According to Waldmann, Hume was wealthy enough not to need income from the plantation, and should have recognized“the enormity of slavery.” Holding thinkers of the past to the standards of the present is a difficult task, when even Hollywoodmoviesfrom four decades ago no longer meet the morality standards of today. Indeed, most of the philosophers whose works underpin Western thought would be canceled in an instant if they were around in 2020. Aristotle saw some people“marked out for subjection”from the moment of birth, while Plato saw the“superior ruling over and having more than the inferior”as just. Later, the Christian theologists of the Middle Ages saw slavery as a natural condition, with Thomas Aquinas describing the master/slave relationship as one similar to that of a parent and child. What’s more, while the philosophy of personal liberty was developed in earnest during the Enlightenment, some of the era’s most prominent thinkers saw black people as naturally inferior to whites. Immanuel Kant, for example, once remarked that“this fellow was quite black...a clear proof that what he said was stupid.”The hierarchy of the races was accepted by many Enlightenment thinkers, with German anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach’s1795description of the“Caucasian”as the world’s most advanced race treated as scientific fact at the time. Hume’s cancellation was met with disbelief online.“So much easier to symbolically flagellate dead 18th century geniuses than meaningfully work on structural issues now,”wrote University of Sussex philosophy professor Kathleen Stock, adding:“not sure they ve really thought this through.” David Hume tower to be renamed: ""the 18th century philosopher whose comments on matters of race, though not uncommon at the time, rightly cause distress today"". So much easier to symbolically flagellate dead 18th century geniuses than meaningfully work on structural issues nowhttps://t.co/CHDof9FJSM Edinburgh University has cancelled / deleted the great enlightenment philosopher David Hume.What a cowardly, stupid, craven, pathetic, spineless, dumb thing to do. Shame on them.https://t.co/3X6xBGu7pg I’m not even sure there was really a *major* push to get Edinburgh University to bin David Hume & yet they have done so anyway. There is a performative quality to this; a kind of cry for attention. That it makes them a laughing-stock hardly matters. “The simple answer,”Jonathan Hearn, a sociology professor at Edinburgh University, wrote in hisblog,“is that we judge people, including intellectuals like Hume, in the round, on their general contributions and accomplishments, not by seeking out any failing we can find and focussing all our attention on that.” Edinburgh University is not unique in its desire to purge itself of any connection to racism, especially not in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in the US this summer. In just one example from the US, activistsdemandedHarvard University rename its Board of Overseers, on account of the word ‘overseer’ having a connection to plantation slavery. In the UK, the Natural History Museum hasmulledremoving its Charles Darwin exhibits, citing his“colonialist scientific expeditions.”On campus though, efforts to sanitize history predate the current blacklivesmatter protests, with Oxford studentsdemandingthe removal of a statue honoring colonialist Cecil Rhodes as far back as 2015, and Liverpool students demanding former Prime Minister William Gladstone’s name beremovedfrom a residence hall, claiming he didn’t fight slavery hard enough.

"12 Sep, 2020","Is America heading for a race war? Unless Democrats stop protecting criminals, it is inevitable","Is the US really a land teeming with ‘white supremacists’, or are malicious forces working to crowbar the racial divide for their own ulterior motives? Whatever the case, America needs to get a handle on the issue, and fast. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Watching the video of George Floyd dying on the street under the knee of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, forced many people to ask themselves: is this yet another case of police brutality that has become so prevalent on the streets of America, or is it symptomatic of something even worse? Without any debate, the mainstream media had a ready-madeanswerfor mass consumption: America is racist to the core and deserves whatever it gets. It was a simplistic, knee-jerk response at a time when America was already suffering under a lockdown due to a pandemic. Race-hustlers need to convince others that America is racist – in order to successfully complete their con!”#RaceOnlyMattersToDemocrats@andersoncooper Before continuing, it is necessary to ask: does America really suffer from ‘systemic racism’, also known as institutional racism? As a white American who grew up in a multiethnic neighborhood and was later employed at several racially diverse workplaces, I would have to disagree. While the proverbial ‘melting pot’ still has some cooking to do, relations between black and white people have been stable for many years. While the nation will never remove the scar of slavery, the creation of a welfare state, together with numerous government programs such as Affirmative Action, was designed to end the discrimination of minorities. And as every American will say, the United States is a ‘nation of immigrants’, an idea reinforced by the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, for example, which opened the door to millions of people of non-European descent. Those sorts of initiatives indicate that Americans are not the hooded pack of white supremacists that many now say they are. This does not mean, of course, that the scourge of racism has been stamped out; there is no shortage of racists and bigots in the US, but to call the problem ‘systemic’ seems overblown. At the same time, however, it cannot be denied that we are now living in radical ‘woke’ times, an entirely new animal. Thus, instead of responding to the outbreaks of violence in the wake of police killings with a unifying message of calm and civility, many politicians, in an effort to appease the angry social justice warriors that keep them in office, are stoking the fires of racial dissent with their rhetoric. You don’t have to read between the lines to understand their message – just listen to Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for the vice presidency. Instead of “DEFUND THE POLICE” they should just come right out and say “LET MORE IMPOVERISHED BLACK PEOPLE DIE”. No need to get linguistically creative—the Left’s objectives are plainly obvious. “Everyone beware,” Harrisremarkedin a recent interview with Stephen Colbert. “They [the protesters] are not going to stop before election day in November, and they’re not going to stop after election day…They’re not going to let up, and they should not, and we should not.” It would be difficult to cite a more irresponsible comment from any individual, and especially one who has a high chance of becoming – considering Joe Biden’s advanced age – the first female president of the United States. This strange new willingness for Democratic leaders to court the mob reared its ugly head again this week, when Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler banned police from using tear gas to quell riots that have plagued the city for more than three months. Mind you, this is the very same mayor who was forced to vacate his condominium last week after rioters set fire to the building. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, a number of influential individuals have declared their support for blacklivesmatter and Antifa. Few would be surprised to know that the financier George Soros, for example, donated almost a quarter of a billion dollars to several racial justice groups, including BLM. He was motivated by “systemic discrimination against blacks that can be traced back to slavery.” On the other end of the spectrum, Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, owned by the global Unilever Company,announcedit was launching a podcast that prompts listeners to “dismantle systemic racism” and white supremacy. Shouldn’t Americans be entitled to a national conversation on the question of ‘systemic racism’ first, before an ice cream company (ice cream!) practically declares it a full-blown fascist regime? After all, the ‘race problem’ could be a symptom of the deplorable state of the police forces, which are, arguably, both overworked and undertrained to handle their assigned tasks. The theory at least deserves much greater attention, but that would deprive the left of an opportunity to appear holier-than-thou in the most consequential presidential election in many decades. blacklivesmatter supporters trash McDonald s and then start a fight with the black managerhttps://t.co/58eNCB4QkZ In any case, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that if these protest groups – which, incidentally, have a large number ofmisguidedwhite youths among their ranks – believe they can act with impunity, while also receiving massive injections of cash and ideological support, things are going to spiral out of control real fast. Just this week, BLM protesters descended upon my hometown of Pittsburgh, where they harassed a group of diners enjoying the afternoon on a café patio. One of the female activists somehow thought it would be a great idea to gulp down one of the beverages on a table where an elderly couple was seated. Earlier, across the country in Portland, Oregon, BLM showed up in the middle of the night to inform ‘privileged’ suburban residents – not all of them white, by the way – that they were living on “occupied” land. If BLM really wants sympathy for its cause, those methods are certainly not the way to get it. In fact, they could trigger an ugly backlash, igniting the very racism that the group declares itself to be fighting in the first place. BLM harasses an elderly couple at a restaurant in Pittsburgh, PApic.twitter.com/NMgvUFaVFa On that note, more white citizens are coming around to the conclusion that they are the ones being subjected to a ‘reverse’ form of racism – or, at the very least, are not permitted to defend themselves from physical harm. That appeared to be the lesson for many after Mark and Patricia McCloskey, two lawyers from an upscale neighborhood in St. Louis,brandishedfirearms after protesters smashed through a gate and trespassed onto their property. Guess who was charged with a crime? Not the protesters. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who received funds for her campaign from none other than Mr. Soros, filed a felony count against the McCloskeys for unlawful use of a weapon. Overnight, it appears that Americans have awakened to a nightmare world turned upside down, where all of the old rules of law and order have been thrown out the window. It’s a place where political leaders no longer allow the police to perform their duties; citizens are condemned as criminals for protecting themselves, and all the while, “fiery yet mostly peaceful protests” are permitted to rage. Before the situation hits the point of no return, America really needs to have a calm discussion about ‘systemic racism’ to determine if it even exists in the first place. In the meantime, find a way to maintain law and order on the streets and, most importantly, trust the police; the majority are not bad apples. America’s future peace and prosperity depends on it.

"11 Sep, 2020","NFL opener ratings tumble to 10-YEAR LOW, despite pent-up demand for football on TV, as league pays price for politicizing sport","Television ratings for the NFL season opener dropped 16 percent from 2019 s opening game, sliding to a 10-year low, marking the first real test of fan response to the league s increasingly woke social activism. Thursday night s game between defending NFL champions the Kansas City Chiefs and last year s AFC South winner, the Houston Texans, drew16.4 million viewersamong adults aged 18-49, Deadline reported. The ratings figures are preliminary, but if they hold at that level when final figures are released, they will be down by millions of fans from last year s opener between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers. Total viewership on NBC and digital platforms was 20.3 million, down from 22.7 million last year, Reuters reported, citing a preliminary NBC estimate. Viewership in the key demographic was pegged at its lowest level since 2010, despite the NFL playing no preseason games this year and a diminished college season leaving sports fans starved for football to watch amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But with the NFL promoting blacklivesmatter and politicizing its product, many fans have vowed to never again watch the league s games. Although attendance at Kansas City s Arrowhead Stadium was limited on Thursday to just 17,000 – less than 25 percent of a normal gameday crowd – because of social distancing, boos could be heard as players and coaches from both teams locked arms before the game for a moment of silence to show solidarity in protesting against racism and social injustice. The Texans stayed in their locker room as the national anthem was played, while at least one Chiefs player knelt. A so-called‘black national anthem’–‘Lift Ev ry Voice’– was also played. Social justice messages were displayed on the scoreboard, and the phrases“End Racism”and“It Takes All of Us”were painted in the end zones. Players were allowed to put decals with the names of alleged victims of racial injustice, such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, on their helmets. Some Twitter users said they have no desire to watch football if the sport is made political.“They made it political with all of their virtue signaling and genuflecting,”one observer said.“Perhaps the fans wanted to take a break from the 24/7 social justice crusade being shoved down their throats and watch some football.” Well.....they made it political with all of their virtue signaling and genuflecting. Perhaps the fans wanted to take a break from the 24/7 social justice crusade being shoved down their throats and watch some football. Isnt that the whole point of bread & circuses? Distraction? While many fans have been turned off, advertisers are fully on board with the league.

"11 Sep, 2020",Judge rules voters can t abolish Georgia county police dept over ex-cop’s slaying of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery,"Georgia citizens will not be able to vote on abolishing the Glynn County Police Department after a former officer and his son were charged with murder for killing black jogger Ahmaud Arbery, a Superior Court judge has ruled. Only local officials have the authority to abolish the police department, the judge ruled on Friday, effectively squelching a bill passed last month that would have put the question before voters in November. The Glynn County Board of Commissioners had filed a lawsuit in August seeking to stop the proposed referendum, arguing that under the state’s constitution, only the commissioners have the right to disband the force. Former Glynn County cop Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged with murder and aggravated assault in May, months after 25-year-old Arbery was shot in a struggle between the three men. The altercation was caught on video, but only after that clip went viral were the charges filed. The footage itself – and the delay in prosecuting the McMichaels – helped fuel the blacklivesmatter movement that erupted nationwide with the police killing of George Floyd in May. The US Justice Department is investigating why it took Glynn County police so long to bring charges against their former colleague. At the same time, the state legislature passed a bill in June to dissolve the department, which would place law enforcement for the area in the hands of the sheriff’s office. Kemp signed the bill into law in August, though state law required voters to sign off on it first – a referendum which is now unlikely to happen. McMichael reportedly told police he pursued Arbery as he jogged through the city of Brunswick because the young man looked like a burglary suspect, calling his son to join the chase. Footage of his final moments shows he attempted to grab a shotgun from one of the men, a move that has been spun as either self-defense or aggression by those on each side of the issue.

"10 Sep, 2020","As Al Sharpton ridicules the idea of defunding the police, it becomes ever clearer that BLM is out of step with many black people","If you listen to the leaders of blacklivesmatter , you’d imagine that most black people across the US want to defund the police.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC Ever since the death of George Floyd, there has been a substantial push from several different angles to defund police departments across the United States. The main driver behind this has been the blacklivesmatter movement. Itswebsite states,“We know that police don’t keep us safe – and as long as we continue to pump money into our corrupt criminal justice system at the expense of housing, health, and education investments – we will never be truly safe.” However, anyone who’s a regular on Twitter would realise that these sentiments do not reflect the opinions of many people in the actual communities that defunding the police  would have consequences for. In fact, according to a Gallup poll, only22 percentof black Americans want the police defunded. In an article from the Star Tribune,many local leaders in Minneapoliswere very much against the police in their community losing funding. The controversial Reverend Al Sharpton was the latest to come out against the idea on Tuesday,saying that only “latte liberals” wanted it. The Hill reported that Minnesota District Attorney Keith Ellison, who is prosecuting the George Floyd case,is not a supporter of it. Local leaders in New York Cityweren’t happy eitherwhen the city proposed cutting a vast amount from the police budget. There are clearly a couple of realities that need to sink in. The first is that the blacklivesmatter movement does not reflect the thoughts of black people at large in the United States. In Chicago, members of blacklivesmatter were chased out of the Englewood neighborhoodby residents. The people who actually live in the area saw BLM’s presence there as an intrusion that would only make relations with the police considerably worse for them. This sentiment is gathering momentum. There are many who don’t want fewer cops or no cops; they want more good cops. A second element worth considering is that there is an obvious difference of opinion between the noisy social media followers of the BLM movement, and the thoughts of many black people across America. You could argue, in fact, that the latter are a silent majority. And any time that votes are going to be counted, those looking to take office should beware the silent majority. The discrepancy between BLM’s demand to defund the police and the desire of this silent majority could be significant. We’ve already seen the number of black voters who approve of Donald Trump riseto a high of 24 percent, and I don’t believe that this is a coincidence as the election closes in. In addition, NBA legend Charles Barkley brought up the concern that Democratsonly talk to black people every four years. The rise of Candace Owens’Blexitmovement and Kanye West’s swing to the political right are also telling. There has long been a belief that the black vote in America is a monolith, but the fact is that any voting bloc can shift. If the Left keeps listening to BLM and moving to take away cops, defunding them or doing anything else that may hurt individual communities, there could be voting repercussions. These communities want reform and improvement. They don’t want to be defenseless, and they don’t want those who protect them to hate them. These communities deserve good cops, and that’s not too much to ask. Black people in America don’t want to toss everything out because the militants of BLM are making a loud noise on the streets and social media.

"9 Sep, 2020",The Kaepernick conundrum: The supposed social value of the former quarterback turned poster boy for BLM is a myth,"The importance of Colin Kaepernick seems to have been inflated since the kneeling protester walked out of the game four years ago.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC Colin Kaepernick has become an odd case in American sports. Were you to talk to someone who works for a left-leaning website, they’d likely tell you that the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is an important sports figure for the modern day. His controversial kneeling protest during the national anthem, which he began in 2016, has been widely adopted following the death of George Floyd. The NFL leadership has admitted Kaepernick had been right all along about the need for social justice, Nike’s renewed its substantial sponsorship deal with him, Netflix and Disney have signed him up to make docuseries, and this week he was back as a virtual player in the next Madden Football game from EA Sports. There’s just one thing that clashes with that apparent importance: it doesn’t look like any club in the NFL wants him on their real team. According to a report byNBC Sports, any interest that was expressed about a Kaepernick return recently was fake. It was out of sympathy after the death of Floyd. Kaepernick himself has flirted with the idea, but he’s hardly put himself out in the process. When he was recently invited to a tryout by the NFL at an event that many teams were attending, he no-showed, and then held his own while wearing a Kunta Kinte shirt (the fictional slave from the 1970s TV series ‘Roots’). I can’t imagine that many scouts wanted to hire someone who compares a million-dollar opportunity to slavery. Even Stephen A. Smith, a supporter of Kaepernick, called out his behavior. He doesn t want to play.pic.twitter.com/ZuSI1IVW9r This is a continuous struggle with Kaepernick and his supporters. Even the writer of the NBC Sports article suggests that, for some reason, Kaepernick has some sort of value to the NFL. He doesn’t, though. Neither for being a face of social justice, nor, especially, for his sporting prowess. The fact of the matter is that the 32-year-old was on the downside of his career when he started his protests in 2016. After the San Francisco 49ers had reached the NFC Championship in 2014, his career went downhill. This was after he signed a six-year contract worth $126 million. By 2015, he was no longer a starter for the team. By the following year, the 49ers were looking to get rid of him anyway. When you look at Kaepernick’s actual history in football without any sort of politics, he comes across as a middle-of-the road second- or third-string quarterback. There was nothing really special about him, aside from the few times he got fined for his temper on the field or wearing headphones he wasn’t supposed to because of sponsor obligation. Then, suddenly, he began to pick out his Afro and became more political. The fact is that Kaepernick is a walking, talking publicity stunt. He fits the right politics for certain media outlets and personalities, and as such they use him as an idol, which is why both Netflix and Disney have signed him up. He’s not going back into Madden’s virtual gridiron because he’s a great football player. The truth is that, particularly after four years out of the game, he’s not even good enough to be re-signed. No one in the NFL wants him. He’s only back in the virtual game because EA Games thinks that he should be for social justice, or they like the publicity that’s going to come from picking him. What social justice is there in putting a mediocre quarterback on a team that wouldn’t, in the real world, want him in the first place? The fact is that Kaepernick is a pampered millionaire who grew up in an adoptive family and had a good life. He knows as much about suffering and police brutality as a member of the Kennedy dynasty. The only suffering he’s had in his life is self-inflicted. If Colin Kaepernick’s value is to be measured, it’s in his own privilege, as opposed to anything earned.

"8 Sep, 2020",Skeptics slam ‘politically-motivated’ study that claims Sturgis motorcycle rally was biggest Covid-19 superspreader event in US,"German researchers claim to have tied a whopping 266,796 Covid-19 cases to a biker rally in Sturgis, South Dakota. That would make it the largest superspreader event in the US – but many are finding holes in their conclusions. Published by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, the Germans’paper lays outsome disturbing numbers. The total public health cost of the 10-day motorcycle rally, which drew almost half a million people to the town of Sturgis during the second week of August, is estimated at a jaw-dropping $12.2 billion, while the rally itself is blamed for 266,796 cases nationwide. The researchers used smartphone tracking technology and health department statistics to monitor the influx of bikers to the small city and trace them back to their home counties. Citing the staggering public health cost generated by their calculations, they claim each rally attendant could have been paid $26,553.64 not to attend in order to avoid the virus spreading. The study also demands more lockdowns and mask mandates as a potential way to mitigate the devastating harm caused by “noncompliant” types. While these conclusions were repeated uncritically across the media andechoed byformer Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb, many on social media – including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem herself – took a closer look at the study and raised questions about both its accuracy and possible political motivations behind it. Noem slammed the paper as “nothing short of an attack on those who exercised their personal freedom to attend Sturgis” in a biting Twitter thread that denounced the researchers’ work as “[not] science. It’s fiction.” Predictably, some in the media breathlessly report on this non-peer reviewed model, built on incredibly faulty assumptions that do not reflect the actual facts and data. (2/) Noting the paper hadn’t gone through peer review, Noem reminded the event’s detractors that their vaunted scientific modeling had also predicted South Dakota would have 10,000 Covid-19 patients swamping its hospitals at the epidemic’s peak. A total of 1,094 patients have ever been hospitalized with coronavirus in the state, with just 68 inpatient as of Tuesday, according to the statehealth department. Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who published a book arguing against the Covid-19 lockdowns that have plunged many world economies deep into depression, also took issue with the numbers the researchers came up with. He questioned how the 260 confirmed cases that had been traced back to the rally as of last week could mushroom into over 260,000 infections. As of Tuesday, just one rally attendee has died with the coronavirus, a man in his 60s with multiple underlying conditions who was hospitalized in an intensive care ward at the time of his death. No, 250 million billion trillion!How stupid do they think we are?A) Positive tests (cases) PLUNGED nationally in August post-Sturgis.B) The number of riders whose cases are directly linked is in the low hundreds - not even 1,000, much less 250,000.https://t.co/Be4nNCoTfS BTW: not that anyone needs to trash the idiotic Sturgis study any further - it has been weighed in the balance and found wanting - but it s worth noting no medical journal would touch it. It was posted on the website of the ""Institute of Labor Economics.""https://t.co/OIczMjHbSd Several journalists did a double-take at the $12.2 billion price tag, which the researchers say assumes a public health cost of $46,000 per case. However, that figure comes from a paper (also publishedby the Institute of Labor Economics) that claimed that as of July 27, there were actually47 millioncoronavirus cases in the US. For reference, there were just 6.3 million confirmed cases in the US as of Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 27 million in the entire world. Journalist Chris Vanderveen pointed out that several counties with a high proportion of Sturgis attendees specifically referenced by the researchers actually saw little or no increase in cases, accusing his fellow reporters of merely reprinting the study’s conclusions without reading it at all – let alone fact-checking it. Jefferson County did see a small bump,... but it didn t sustain itselfhttps://t.co/c5MP13mOAxpic.twitter.com/SfXVOGsfKN To be clear, I m not saying the study is wrong... But I am guessing most reporters reporting on this have yet to even read the studyHere it is if you want to read it:https://t.co/07szutxv9X The researchers attempt to explain away any such discrepancies by claiming Sturgis attendees are “non-compliant” types who tend to avoid Covid-19 testing and contact tracing and thus likely to elude diagnosis. However, a Twitter user claiming to be a Sturgis residentpointed outthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had specifically sought out rally attendees for testing and contact-tracing, hinting the agency was deliberately trying to demonize the event and pointing out that “THOUSANDS of visitors” had come to the town for non-rally purposes. University of Nebraska Medical Center epidemiologist Ali Khan alsoquestionedthe singling out of Sturgis, arguing “that’s how infectious diseases work with mass gatherings events” and suggesting colleges welcoming students back for the fall would experience similar surges. Many also questioned why the researchers had zeroed in on the Sturgis rally while ignoring the blacklivesmatter protests and riots that have raged across the US since the police killing of George Floyd in May, accusing them of a political hit job. Interesting how one event in Sturgis where partiots congregated turned into a supposed super spreader of#COVID19costing $12 billion.Just imagine then, the TRILLIONS in cost and massive loss of life from riots EVERY night in Democrat cities!Where is that study?#MAGAhttps://t.co/MkH7P03dzO The analysis here was:1) calculate a crude number of increased cases in South Dakota and county 2) multiply that by the “costs of COVID” number generated from a study of dubious efficacy3) conclude Sturgis cost $12.2 gorillion Whatever - now do cost of Summer of BLM Riotshttps://t.co/mGA4RQdUYK Actually, the paper’s authorsdidresearch blacklivesmatter protests, publishing apaper on the subjectfor the National Bureau for Economic Research back in June. They argued the demonstrations actuallyslowedthe spread of the virus, because many people in the cities where they took place were staying home to avoid the chaos. Mainstream media hailed their conclusions as proof BLM protests were actually a boon to public health, and Democratic mayors like New York’s Bill de Blasio and Seattle’s Jenny Durkan rolled out the red carpet for the protesters, even while banning other types of public gatherings.

"8 Sep, 2020","Defunding the police is for latte liberals living in the Hamptons, Al Sharpton blasts, says ‘proper policing’ needed","Civil rights activist turned MSNBC host has made it clear he is not in support of defunding the police, calling the idea something only a “latte liberal” would support. On the same episode of ‘Morning Joe’ where co-anchor Willie Geist downplayed violence in New York City, saying it does not feel“different or unsafe”to him, Sharpton highlighted increasing crime. “We’ve always heard about the tale of two cities,”he said.“On the side of the city that I come from, which is Blacker and poorer, we’ve seen more in terms of gun usage. I got a lot of attention when I did the eulogy for George Floyd’s funeral, but I also, a month later, preached a 1-year-old kid’s funeral in Brooklyn who was killed by a stray bullet.” “Six people were shot over Labor Day weekend at a festivity in Brooklyn, so I would say statistically we’re not much higher than where we were, but on the ground it is certainly feeling more violent, feeling more unsafe in unsafe communities,”Sharpton continued. Asked by host Joe Scarborough about the moves to defund the police in various cities following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Sharpton tore apart the idea, chalking it up as something only appealing to“latte liberals”discussing an“academic”issue. “To take all policing off is something a latte liberal may go for as they sit around the Hamptons discussing this as an academic problem. But people living on the ground need proper policing,”he said.

The number was far less than some protesters called for, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). “Defunding police means defunding police,”the congresswoman said at the time.“It does not mean budget tricks or funny math.” New York City has seen asurgein shootings this year, with the city pushing past 1,000 before the Labor Day weekend even began.

"8 Sep, 2020",BLM-inspired performance on Britain’s Got Talent triggers HUNDREDS of complaints to Ofcom,"The UK’s media watchdog Ofcom was flooded with hundreds of complaints from angry TV viewers after a blacklivesmatter (BLM) movement-inspired dance routine was performed on Britain s Got Talent (BGT) over the weekend. Ofcom has received some 2,966 complaints over the episode of the show aired on Saturday night, the watchdog said. Almost all of the complaints have been related to the BLM-inspired routine, performed by dance troupe Diversity. “We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate,”an Ofcom spokesperson said Tuesday. The watchdog did not elaborate on the specific details of the complaints. The supposedly scandalous dance routine was led by Ashley Banjo, who is also a BGT judge. According to the performer, Diversity“wanted to express how the events of this year have made us feel.” So much to say... But I’ll Just let the performance talk. Thousands of messages of Love and support - Thank you 🖤 For the thousands of messages of hate and ignorance - Thank you. You highlight exactly what needs to change. Sending nothing but love to you all 🙏🏽🇬🇧#Diversitypic.twitter.com/3kP0ymUj88 During the routine, another performer dressed as a police officer kneeled on Banjo’s neck, in a simulation of the death of George Floyd in US police custody in May, which sparked a mass protest movement against police brutality. The dance was accompanied by a narrative that included such lines as“What we thought we knew, some clearly didn t. blacklivesmatter .” BLM protests have been raging across the US since May and in some cases have devolved into violence and rioting. Some of that violence has spilled over into other countries, including the UK. BLM protesters have attacked and toppled various landmarks related to Britain’s colonial past and even replaced the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol with a monument of their own. The new statue, however, was promptly removed by the city council. The performance triggered a mixed response on social media, with some viewers praising the“art”and the political statement. I absolutely loved your performance last night! So emotive and a very important message to get across. I had goosepimples watched, so proud of you all! I thought you were brilliant as a judge last night, just as you are on dancing on ice. I think they did get it right. Addressing race isn’t political it’s human. There was also patriot positivity in there referencing the NHS and more. We have to love each other. And we have to do more; we have to listen ❤️❤️❤️ Others, however, were not impressed, accusing the group of turning the entertainment show into political theatrics and questioning the meaning of the whole message. Appalling to use a light entertainment show to indulge in cheap political theatrics. Fortunately, I watched a recording, so was able to skip straight through the diversity segment. not sure it is appropriate for a Saturday family show, can you not see that your putting out negativity by suggesting some need to change? I’m a huge diversity fan and admire you for your creativity and talent just not sure you got it right this time though I absolutely love Diversity & completely understand the BLM message but that felt uncomfortable. Not sure it was appropriate to be airing political views & taking the knee on this show. Judgement error I think 😞 ",https://www.rt.com/uk/500177-blm-performance-ofcom-complaints/
"7 Sep, 2020",Spoiled rich kids are driving ‘BLM’ rampages and are never held accountable for their behavior – just like the cops they revile,"Many were shocked when a wealthy young woman was charged after a blacklivesmatter riot in NYC. But that wealth means she won’t have to answer for her behavior – not unlike the murderous cops she’s supposedly protesting. is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Those born into wealth often grow up without ever being disciplined for their misdeeds, coddled by nannies and guilty parents and handled with kid gloves by local authorities when their transgressions can no longer be covered up. Clara Kraebber, the 20-year-old charged with first-degree rioting over the weekend after she was part of a group of eight accused of causing $100,000-worth of damage in lower Manhattan, fits the profile to a T. Ironically, her sense of invulnerability mirrors that of the cops who killed George Floyd, Eric Garner, Daniel Shaver and every other unarmed person who’s died at the hands of police confident they’ll go unpunished for their crime. The ‘bad apples’ of the police force know they can take out their frustrations on the local population because prosecutors are unwilling to alienate law enforcement, lest they never be able to get another conviction. But why would someone like Kraebber run around with black-bloc Antifa types intent on destroying property? She’s a college student home from Rice University, which like most schools shut down in the spring due to the pandemic. She’s likely bored out of her mind, being denied the usual 20-year-old’s entertainments of underage drinking and partying. And she’s been protesting for years: media coverage of her latest legal troubles revealed she was at an NYC march for Ferguson shooting victim Michael Brown at the tender age of 14 and has been seeking out more radical groups ever since. Kraebber, whose parents own not just a $1.8 million Upper East Side penthouse but also a four-fireplace mansion in the Connecticut suburbs, doesn’t have to worry about the “don’t s*** where you eat” directive that keeps pissed-off urban residents and small-town cops alike from unleashing their darker urges on their home streets. The New York Post quoted several small business owners who, while they were sympathetic with BLM’s message, found their approach – as seen on Friday night in Manhattan’s window-smashing rampage – counterproductive. The viewpoint is one many New Yorkers who’ve been on the wrong end of the NYPD tend to agree with. But like those same abusive NYPD officers, many of whom call the Long Island suburbs or the far reaches of Staten Island home, Kraebber can retreat to the safety of her family’s Litchfield County mansion at any time – and, indeed, had already done so when she was contacted by the Post, which called to ask about her arrest on Saturday. She doesn’t have to deal with the fallout of her actions in the overcrowded, pandemic-panicked city. One of the rioters arrested in NYC is the daughter of an architect and psychiatrist. The family owns a $1.8 million apartment and a home with four fireplaces in Connecticut.https://t.co/MOZ0ptVSIc Even before bail reform, her family would have paid to spring her from jail, and now, they merely need to pony up for a good lawyer to get her off the hook for the four-year sentence she faces on those riot charges. And with city prosecutors – not just in New York – increasingly unlikely to hold rioters accountable for their actions, the country can expect a lot more troublemakers to bloom when they realize they can get away with anything short of murder and haveprosecutors turn a blind eye. While ‘LARPing’ – live action roleplaying, essentially playacting at being revolutionaries or militiamen – is a charge more often leveled at the clashing ‘armies’ of Trump supporters and Antifa types in Portland and Seattle, Kraebber and herwealthy brethrentruly deserve the label. And even those who play lawyers in real life – New York’s Urooj Rahman and Colinford Mattis, for example – have gotten into revolutionary “character,” allegedlyplaying firebombing anarchistsin the current BLM production. But the joke’s on Kraebber and her fellow ‘protesters’, who are doing the bidding of those same police they are supposedly demonstrating against by driving small business owners and law-abiding New Yorkers into law enforcement’s arms. Potential allies who might have come out and demonstrated against abusive cops are instead driven to call 911 as they see the black-clad umbrella-wielding posse descending on their store. Those who genuinely believe in the fight against police brutality – which is a real problem, especially in cities like New York, Louisville, Mesa, and every other metro area that has seen police kill innocent people with impunity – would be wise to condemn, even expel, the Kraebbers in their ranks. Certainly Kraebber and her friends shouting “every city, every town, burn the precinct to the ground!” – as they reportedly did on Friday – is not going to win a lot of friends among the city’s permanent residents when the police are the only thing standing between this roving mob of bored “youths” (as she herself described her protesting pals years ago) and their being able to feed their families, or keep them alive. Because as the spoiled rich kids run around breaking windows, the violence in New York keeps growing. Five people were shot in the early-morning hours of Labor Day alone during Brooklyn’s J’Ouvert festival. While the event is somewhat notorious for outbreaks of violence, this year’s was over the top, wounding even a six year-old child – and has been mirrored by a massive spike in assaults and murders across the city. New York is only sinking, and while Kraebber’s parents might be able to afford to lose their investment, those who have no suburban redoubt to flee to have no choice but to live with the results.

"7 Sep, 2020",Still ‘mostly peaceful?’: Disturbing Portland ‘Kill press’ graffiti spotted by heavily armored journalists,"A disturbing image purporting to show journalists photographing graffiti which reads, “Kill Press” in the besieged city of Portland has generated shockwaves online, as tensions between activists and the media continue to ramp up. Despite ongoing mainstream media efforts todownplaythe widespread rioting across the US in recent months as“mostly peacefulprotests,”time and time again, blacklivesmatter and Antifa activists and agitators have turned on the press. The rapidly deteriorating relationship between the sprawling protest movements and local and national media was captured somewhat neatly by a photo purporting to show the words“Kill Press”scrawled on a wall in Portland this past weekend. I love how they keep telling us exactly what they areThey say they are racistsThey say Revolution nothing lessThey say Kill The PressThey Say Liberals get The Bullet TooDemocrats refuse to call Antifa And BLM Extremists out by name why?https://t.co/flopCOXDQ6 Despite repeated claims of peaceful intent from protesters and theirsympathizersin the MSM, extreme violence has accompanied well-intentioned racial justice and anti-police brutality marches fromSeattletoWashington DC, fromKenoshatoPortland, andNYC. Many online were stunned by the anti-press graffiti,warningthat the violent agitators would“reap what they sow.”Some went as far as describing Antifa and BLM as“terrorists,”while others still wondered aloud whether the movements would be declared a national security threat. So far we’ve seen; kill the press, defund the police, burn down the banks...when do we get to call this what it is, an insurrection. CNN’s own headquarters in Atlanta were trashed by protesters in June, forcing the company to erect a Trump-esquewallaround the building to provide additional security for its staff. The families ofJacob BlakeandGeorge Floyd, two black men who were shot by police, sparking major backlash, have made repeated pleas for peace in the streets which appear to have fallen on deaf ears. As protests turned violent this past weekend, members of the mob could be heard shouting:“If you ain’t police, donot record crimes,”in an apparent veiled threat against citizen and independent journalists known to risk their lives covering the ongoing unrest sweeping the nation.

"6 Sep, 2020","Do not pass GO, do not collect $200? Feds step in to prosecute Portland rioters after local DA declines to enforce the law","The Trump administration is giving rioters in Portland at least a risk of accountability, filing US District Court charges when the local district attorney declines to prosecute and deputizing state police to make federal arrests. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. Kevin Phomma became the latest Portland protester to be hit with federal charges, as the US Attorney s Office for the region announced on Friday that he was indicted for felony civil disorder. Phomma, 26, who allegedlyassaulted police with bear spray,faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison if convicted. The indictment marked the seventh such case this week and followed anannouncementby US Attorney Billy Williams that 74 people were being charged with federal crimes in connection with crimes they committed during anarchist riots that have raged on for three months in the aftermath of George Floyd s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25. “The nightly violence has to stop,”said US Marshal Russel Burger.“It is drowning out the voices of the many who are calling for change and pulling police resources away from their primary mission of keeping this community safe.” The prosecutorial push follows clashes between Washington and local and state officials after President Donald Trump sent federal law enforcement officers to Portland earlier this summer to help quell violent protests by Antifa and blacklivesmatter . Those federal forces began a phased pullout in late July after Oregon Governor Kate Brown agreed to assign state police to protect the federal courthouse in Portland. Since then, the feds have deputized state troopers, giving them the option of arresting violent protesters to be prosecuted under federal laws. Such an option could be appealing for police, who have seen protesters released without charge after being arrested for riot-related crimes. READ MORE: Two BLM Portland protesters hit with federal felony charges after allegedly targeting cops’ eyes with high-powered lasers Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said last month that his office would drop most of the charges that had been filed against protestors in Portland. Nor will Schmidt s office proceed with cases against accused rioters unless there s also an allegation of specific property damage or use of force.“What we re doing is recognizing that the right to speak and have your voice heard is extremely important,”the DAsaid. Police said that approach is giving rioters confidence that they won t face consequences for their crimes, which is making the situation even more dangerous.“If it is acceptable for rioters to commit acts of violence against community members and to try and burn down occupied buildings, and if this conduct is allowed to continue, then Portland is lost,”Portland Police Association President Daryl Turnersaidin a message last month to Schmidt and Mayor Ted Wheeler. One example of how Schmidt s policy is playing out is Travis Hessel, who waschargedon May 31 with several felonies, including burglary, for crimes he allegedly committed as BLM protests began in Portland. Schmidt s office dismissed those charges on August 3, and Hessel was arrested the next day for allegedly assaulting a police officer with a baton during an Antifa attack on a police precinct office. He was quickly released without charges. Another example is Michael Reinoehl, an Antifa activist who was arrested in July for carrying a loaded weapon, resisting arrest and interfering with police. He was released without charges being pursued and allegedly stalked and murdered a Patriot Prayer group demonstrator, Aaron Jay Danielson, on August 29. Reinoehl was killed on Thursday night when he allegedly drew his weapon as federal law enforcement officers tried to arrest him for shooting Danielson. The violence in Portland has been so severe that Wheeler announced that he s leaving his upscale condominium in the Pearl District after rioters firebombed the building on Monday. But Wheeler has blamed Trump for the rise in violence, saying the president has created“the hate and the division.” Being charged in federal court is clearly a concern for violent protesters. About 90 percent of federal indictments lead to guilty pleas,accordingto Pew Research Center. Less than one percent of defendants in the government s 2018 fiscal year went to trial and won acquittal. A group that has raised $1.35 million through GoFundMe tobail Portland protesters outof jail sent out a notice to supporters on Friday, saying that it has confirmed reports that FBI agents have begun visiting the homes of demonstrators in the past week. Some of those visits resulted in arrests and filing of federal charges, in some cases where similar state charges had been dropped and some cases when state charges were still pending. The notice included tips on dealing with an FBI visit, such as“don t answer the door”and“do not talk to the police.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499978-portland-rioters-deferal-charges/
"5 Sep, 2020","Trump doubles down on ‘critical race theory’ ban, promising to EXTINGUISH controversial diversity training","After ordering federal agencies to stop spending tax dollars on ‘anti-racism’ training, President Trump called ‘critical race theory’ a “sickness,” and vowed to “quickly extinguish” it from the government. Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought sent a memo to government agencies on Friday,directingthem to suspend ‘critical race theory’ seminars and training. In the memo, he called the controversial sessions“divisive, anti-American propaganda,”that tells white people they“contribute to racism”and“benefit from racism.” As Trump’s supporters cheered the ban, the president himself doubled down on Saturday.“This is a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue,”he tweeted.“Please report any sightings so we can quickly extinguish!” Trump Orders Purge of ‘Critical Race Theory‘ from Federal Agencieshttps://t.co/ygXcTXRHsQvia@BreitbartNewsThis is a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue. Please report any sightings so we can quickly extinguish! Critical race theory has existed in academia since the 1980s, but exploded into the mainstream in recent months, as ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests and riots swept across the US following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. Its core concepts are the existence of ‘white privilege’ – the notion that America is founded on“white supremacy”and“institutional racism,”and that all white people must be pushed to confront their own“unconscious racism.” Some of its most ardent preachers have spun their teachings into a viable cottage industry, with author and academic Robin DiAngelo, for instance, charging upwards of $20,000 to lecture corporate boards on the original sin of whiteness. Trump’s ban came after a number of conservative reporters revealed thatfederal employees– from FBI agents through treasury officials tonuclear scientists– were being ‘educated’ on how to deconstruct their“white male culture.” While the ban was celebrated by conservatives, some critical race theory fans saw it as proof that Trump is a racist.“It wasn’t a fluke that he just used ‘extinguish,”feminist writer Amee Vanderpool tweeted, as others accused“the Trump regime”of opening up“a new front in its war to perpetuate white supremacy.” Critical Race Theory examines society/culture as it relates to race, law, and power to attempt to understand how victims of systemic racism are affected and are able to represent themselves to counter prejudice.It was not a fluke that he just used ""extinguish.""https://t.co/vL00KaZYBC I m trying to understand why this is smart.

But his sister told the media she saw it coming. Reinoehl“attempted to escape arrest and produced a firearm”before he was killed by law enforcement, Attorney General Barr revealed in astatementreleased on Friday, confirming initial reports of what happened Thursday night when a fugitive task force swept in to arrest him in Lacey, Washington. The self-professed Antifa member, suspected of killing Patriot Prayer“friend and supporter”Aaron ‘Jay’ Danielson during a riot last Saturday in Portland, had fled across the border from Oregon after local cops secured a warrant for his arrest. Describing Reinoehl as a“dangerous fugitive, admitted Antifa member, and suspected murderer,”Barr congratulated the officers on“prevent[ing] him from escaping justice,”declaring“the streets of our cities are safer with this violent agitator removed.”Tracking and taking down the alleged killer were, according to the attorney general,“an unmistakable demonstration that the United States will be governed by law, not violent mobs.” Many on social media were appalled at the tone of Barr’s statement, excoriating the AG for his“vigilantism.” Appalling that AG Barr uses a vigilantism tone.More appropriately- we are disappointed that we were unable to bring the suspect to face justice in a court of law. Loss of life is never our goal but the suspect left law enforcement no choice This is a stunning statement. Reinoehl was shot and killed by police and Barr calls that justice.Justice is a charge, a trial, a verdict and a sentence. I would expect the Attorney General of the United States to know that.https://t.co/bB9IoUUPyb Stating that law enforcement ""prevented him from escaping justice"" & that PDX is safer with Reinoehl ""removed"" is ominous.It portrays his extrajudicial killing as ""justice” & hints that law enforcement are supported in killing anarchists or ""antifa"".https://t.co/rEyh2MgLSypic.twitter.com/nLaXjixaxk While Reinoehl had all but confessed to killing Danielson, he was being“hunted by people on the right,”one user pointed out, implying the dead man might have mistaken the herd of (uniformed, heavily armed) law enforcement officers for a right-wing militia. Said his lawyer thought he had a reasonable case for self-defense. He also knew he was being hunted by people on the right. I’d like to see how the people who shot him were dressed & how they identified themselves. Others were morepreoccupiedwith how Barr’s statement might put other Antifa members in danger, suggesting the killing was meant to“signal”that acts of“state murder”are justified retribution for“self-defense against fascists.”In that vein, several users brought up the Trump administration’s ongoing“failure”to condemnKyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois 17-year-old who killed two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, allegedly in self-defense. Rittenhouse has been charged with first-degree murder. AG Barr praises the killing of Portland shooting suspect Reinoehl. But what did he have to say about the arrest of Kyle Rittenhouse? Even some of those who agreed with Barr’s perception of Reinoehl as a dangerous fugitive worried that his killing would make the Antifa activist into a martyr, opening the door to further violence. Doj claims the streets are safer without violent agitators Michael Reinoehl. Given the reactions I ve seen proclaiming him a martyr and his death a murder, I feel they are gravely mistaken.https://t.co/SY9iKSJFpm Unlike many on social media, Reinoehl’s own sister April didn’t seem surprised at his death,tellingthe Daily Mail Thursday night that she’d seen it coming for some time.“I’ve been saying to people for a while, if he doesn’t turn himself in he’s going to get himself killed,”she said. While April mourned her estranged brother and expressed concern for her niece and nephew, she said she knew Reinoehl was prone to“act[ing] impulsively, letting the worst emotions guide his actions.”She had hoped he would“take responsibility for what happened with dignity,”she said, resigned to the fact that her brother’s killing would just open the door to“more violence.” Reinoehl’s violent death might not have shocked his sister, but April was“surprised a police officer did it,”having expected“the angry population of people who were out for blood”– meaning Patriot Prayer and aligned right-wing groups – to attempt to avenge Danielson’s death. They“had a contract out for him,”she claimed. Grateful“it wasn’t vigilante justice that got”her brother, she nevertheless predicted he’d be made into a martyr, since his death at police hands“validat[es]…all the anger”that Reinoehl s fellow Antifa members have against law enforcement –“whether or not it’s correct or righteous.” In the now-infamousVice interviewin which Reinoehl seems to confess to shooting Danielson, he ‘rationalizes’ the violent act by claiming a friend (who he felt compelled to describe as“of color”) would have been killed had he not opened fire. He was“confident [he] did not hit anyone innocent,”he said, claiming he hadn’t turned himself in to police because they were in league with right-wing protesters and going to jail would leave his family defenseless. One matter Reinoehl, his sister, and the social media peanut-gallery appeared to agree upon was the looming presence of what the slain activist described as“a civil war right around the corner.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499915-barr-reinoehl-civil-war/
"4 Sep, 2020",Two BLM Portland protesters hit with federal felony charges after allegedly targeting cops’ eyes with high-powered lasers,"Two blacklivesmatter protesters have been hit with rare civil disorder federal felony charges after they allegedly targeted the eyes of law enforcement officers with high-powered lasers during riots in Portland. Eva Warner, also known as Joshua Warner, and Hugo Ryan Berteau-Pavy were charged with the offences following separate incidents that took place after riots had been declared by the police. According to court documents, the case against Berteau-Pavy relates to an incident on June 13 around the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland. The activist allegedly stood in the middle of the street, after a riot had been declared, and repeatedly hit several officers in the face with high-powered lasers. He is also accused of targeting the mayor’s house and other residences. The incident involving Warner took place on August 8, during unrest in North Portland. The police declared a riot after protesters broke into Portland Police Association’s premises, smashed windows, and set fire to the office. The rioters also used vehicles and dumpsters to illegally block nearby vehicle traffic. During the disturbances, Warner allegedly targeted several officers with a high-powered laser as they attempted to disperse the riot. She was arrested at the scene, and a black pen-style laser was found on her person. Both Warner and Berteau-Pavy had prior arrests on state charges, which were dropped by the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office. The charges bring the number of people facing federal felony allegations over the course of Portland’s summer of unrest to five. The use of federal charges is an illustration that Oregon’s US Attorney’s Office is fulfilling its promise to escalate the consequences for alleged crimes that occur during riots. Portland has now endured 99 straight nights of protests since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police in May. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499895-portland-protesters-federal-charges-lasers/
"4 Sep, 2020",‘I had no choice’: Portland’s ‘100% Antifa’ suspect says he shot & killed Trump supporter in self-defense,"The man suspected of fatally shooting a conservative activist during a protest in downtown Portland has claimed he acted in self-defense, saying he believed a friend was about to be “stabbed” and “had no choice” but to open fire. Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, told Vice News in an interview on Thursday that he feared for his life just before the shooting last weekend, which left Aaron ‘Jay’ Danielson dead. The victim was taking part in a rally in support of US President Donald Trump at the time. “You know, lots of lawyers suggest that I shouldn t even be saying anything, but I feel it s important that the world at least gets a little bit of what s really going on,”said Reinoehl, who claims to have provided“security”for ongoing blacklivesmatter protests in Portland and described himself in social media posts as“100% Antifa”and ready for“war.” I had no choice – I mean, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn t going to do that. To date, no witnesses have come forward to corroborate Reinoehl’s version of events, which appears to contradict footage captured at the time of the shooting. Though one clip records onlyaudioof the confrontation, a man is heard shouting“He’s macing you, he’s pulling it out,”seconds before gunfire erupts. Otherfootagetaken from a different angle appears to show Danielson discharge a cloud of pepper spray, and is at no point seen brandishing a knife. It is not clear what started the altercation. Though Reinoehl isreportedlya main suspect in the Portland Police Bureau’s homicide investigation, no arrests have yet been made, in contrast to another recent protest-related shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The suspect in that case, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, was arrested less than 24 hours after the event and has since been charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Chandler Pappas, who accompanied Danielson to the Trump rally on Saturday night and stood mere feet away from the shooting, said he believes the pair were singled out because they looked like easy targets, also claiming neither he nor Danielson had encountered the shooter before that moment. “I think the two of us alone, away from the rest of the Trump rally with all the trucks and all the other noise going on, I think they isolated us and thought they could get away with it,” Pappas said in aninterviewstreamed on Facebook.“I think they were looking for somebody to hurt. I think they were looking for somebody just like us, who was down there unprotected.” Protests have raged in Portland for some 100 consecutive days, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. After enduring a deployment of federal agents to the city earlier this summer, the demonstrations are ongoing, seeing frequent clashes between activists and law enforcement and showing few signs of slowing down.

"4 Sep, 2020","THAT’s racist: California professor suspended, students offered emotional ‘support’ to remedy ‘harmful impact’ of CHINESE word","A communications professor at the University of Southern California has been reassigned after using a common Chinese filler word during a lecture, which black students complained sounded like a racial slur in English. During a recent online lecture at the USC Marshall School of Business, Professor Greg Patton was explaining that Mandarin Chinese uses“that”the same way Americans use“like”or“um,”as filler. The word in Mandarin is“nega,”and Patton’s lecture prompted someone to complain that it sounded too much like an English derogatory term for people of African descent. I cannot believe this is real, but it is. This USC Professor is on leave after students were offended that a Chinese word he used during a lecture on foreign languages sounded like an english racial slur.Watch the video for yourself:pic.twitter.com/HkFPMEP5I2 Patton“offended all of the black members of our class,”according to an August 21 email sent to the administration by a group of students identifying themselves as“Black MBA Candidates”class of 2022, and obtained by National Review. The email says Patton used the word“approximately five times”during the lesson, in each of his three communication classes. The black students were“appalled”by it. Claiming the actual pronunciation of the word is“much different”from Patton’s, the students accused the professor of“negligence and disregard”and said the lecture affected their mental health. We would rather not take his course than to endure the emotional exhaustion of carrying on with an instructor that disregards cultural diversity and sensitivities and by extension creates an unwelcome environment for us black students. “In light of the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the recent and continued collective protests and social awakening across the nation, we cannot let this stand,”the email concluded. Treating 那个 as having anything to do w/ racist language is the closest thing to racism going on here. To refuse to engage with Chinese culture & make the Chinese language conform to one s American experience is cultural ignorance at best--racism at worst.@USCshould be ashamed. The Los Angeles-based school confirmed to Campus Reform on Tuesday that a faculty member“used a Chinese word that sounds similar to a racial slur in English.” “We acknowledge the historical, cultural and harmful impact of racist language,”USC Marshall said in a statement, noting that Patton“agreed to take a short term pause”while the matter is under review. Another instructor has taken over the class for the time being. USC Marshall is“committed to building a culture of respect and dignity where all members of our community can feel safe, supported, and can thrive,”the school statement added, noting that“supportive measures”were offered to students, faculty or staff who requested them. RT reached out to USC Marshall for comment, and was told that the statement provided to Campus Reform was accurate, and that there was no additional information at this time. US universities have long been at the forefront of struggle sessions for“racial justice,”which have only intensified over the summer even as the Covid-19 pandemic kept schools either closed or open only virtually. In July, the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) issued astatementdemanding an end to“academic language and standard English”in the classrooms in favor of“black language”or“Ebonics.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499831-chinese-word-professor-racism/
"3 Sep, 2020",Democratic St. Louis mayor forced to move away from home over BLM protests happening on doorstep,"The mayor of Missouri’s St. Louis revealed to the media that she hasn’t stayed at her home since July due to protests in the vicinity, becoming the second Democratic politician forced to relocate by blacklivesmatter rallies. “We have not lived at home for two months,”Mayor Lyda Krewson said in a text message to media outlet STL Today. Krewson and her husband relocated“to de-escalate”the situation and“save police resources”during a series of protests that took place outside her home in the Central West End. Another reason for the move was that“our neighbors were being disturbed and threatened,”Krewsonsaid, adding,“I ran for this job – my neighbors did not.”The mayor said that she hadn’t stayed at her place since late July, and used her and her husband’s own money to temporarily relocate. READ MORE: 4 police officers shot in St. Louis as mayhem over George Floyd’s death rages on Throngs of blacklivesmatter protesters have gathered near Krewson’s house several times in June and July, fuelled by the nationwide outrage over the death of black Minnesotan George Floyd in police custody. Protesters demanded that she defund the St. Louis police department, which she refused to do. Krewson herself defended her stance, insisting that law enforcement need to be funded appropriately and that supporting them“should not be a partisan issue.” Back in late June, demonstrators demanded that Krewson step down after she publicly read out the names and addresses of people calling for police reform. The Democratic mayor laterapologizedto the public, saying she did not intend“to harm anyone or cause distress”by broadcasting the addresses and names in question. Interestingly, one such procession on June 28 passed by the house of St. Louis attorneys Mark and Patricia McCloskey who gained nationwide media attention for standing guard outside their property armed with a pistol and an assault rifle. The couple, who recently appeared among supporters of President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, was then charged for illegal use of firearms. Krewson is not alone in escaping the perils of living in the middle of blacklivesmatter rallies. On Wednesday, the mayor of riots-plagued Portland, Ted Wheeler, announced he left his lavish condo after rioters pelted the building with projectiles on Monday. Staying there would be“unfair to all of you who have no role in politics or in my administration,”the Democratic politician explained.

"2 Sep, 2020",Biden campaign tries to seize ‘law and order’ message from Trump with new ad condemning rioting,"With violent protests and riots chipping away at his poll numbers, Joe Biden has released a new ad condemning looting and “lawlessness.” His ad comes as the Trump campaign gears up to push similar but more extreme TV messages. Since the killing of George Floyd in May triggered a summer of nationwide protests and riots, President Donald Trump has savaged Democrat mayors and governors for not cracking down hard enough on criminality, and roasted Joe Biden for his reluctance to condemn the violence strongly enough. With reaction among Washington Democrats ranging from denial (Rep. Jerry Nadlercalledstreet violence in Portland a“myth,”for example) to outrightencouragement, the riots finally appear to havehurtBiden’s polling, narrowing the gap between the former vice president and Trump to single digits. Biden has now switched tack. In a campaign video released on Tuesday, the presidential hopeful declares that“Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple.”Biden accuses Trump of“fanning the flames”of violence, his supporters of“acting as an armed militia,”and his“divisive”rhetoric of instilling“fear in America.” The ad does not directly call out the violence of Antifa rioters or blacklivesmatter supporters. Trump’s often-armed supporters, like those who turned up and faced off against rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin – claiming they were there to protect property –  are the only group of citizens criticized for violence. Nevertheless it is the strongest ‘law and order’ statement from Biden to date. It will be aired in key battleground states this month as part of a $53 million TV spending push. The Trump campaign has spent a similar amount of cash, with around $49 million worth of TV airtime booked for September, according to a recent CNN report. Trump’s latest ads hit the airwaves on Wednesday. One ad, which will air in the riot-hit state of Wisconsin, paints Biden’s response to the riots as weak, taking a knee in support of BLM while“lawless criminals terrorize Kenosha.”A similar ad focuses on Minneapolis, where rioting first kicked off in May. Trump, by contrast, is portrayed as a“strong”leader, whose mobilization of federal resources in Wisconsin and Minnesota saved these Democrat-run states from further anarchy. Anotheradset to air in a number of battleground states accuses Democrats of“fanning the flames of lawlessness,”while portraying Trump as the guardian of America’s“hopes and values and faith.” According to an NBC poll released in mid-August, Trump leads Biden 43-39 percent on fighting crime, though it is still unknown how the destruction of Kenosha may have changed that figure. In a visit to the Kenosha on Tuesday, Trump kept his rhetoric strong, standing amid the ruins of the city’s businesses, the president called the recent spate of riots“domestic terrorism,”and pledged his support to the nation’s law enforcement. Biden will visit Kenosha on Thursday, though he is unlikely to directly ape Trump’s unequivocal pro-law enforcement stance. Instead, his campaign said that he will“hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499738-biden-trump-ads-crime/
"2 Sep, 2020",Liberal bias? Google appears to be hiding search suggestions that cast blacklivesmatter in a negative light,"Google’s automatic search suggestions for ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ reveal a strikingly positive image of the movement, with almost all negative references appearing to have been cleansed from the automated results. As protests and riots swept the nation following the death of George Floyd in May, Googlesearchesfor ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ spiked a hundredfold. Given that these protests have resulted in multiple deaths, widespread looting, and the burning down of parts of several major urban centers, one would expect that a search for ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ would bring up some criticism of the movement. Yet this is not so. As of Wednesday afternoon, keying ‘BLM’ into Google’s search bar returns only two suggested results: ‘BLM Israel’ and ‘BLM issues’. Entering ‘ blacklivesmatter is’ likewise gives two answers: ‘ blacklivesmatter is not a design challenge,’ and ‘ blacklivesmatter is a revolutionary peace movement.’ Google’s rivals show a different set of results. DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine, shows a range of positive and negative results, from ‘blm is peaceful’ to ‘blm is a cancer.’ Yahoo offers an even more negative list, including ‘blm is a terrorist organization’ and ‘blm is a hate group.’ Different phrasing generates different results, with some search questions bringing back results suggesting that blacklivesmatter is a controversial movement. For example, typing ‘Does BLM’ prompts Google to suggest ‘Does blm condone looting.’ Similarly, Google completes ‘why do blm’ with ‘why do blm protests loot.’ The curious discrepancy in results was first noticed by conservative news outletBreitbarton Tuesday. When the outlet pressed Google on the issue, a spokesperson did not acknowledge any deliberate effort to suppress certain results. Instead, they told Breitbart that Google has“systems in place to prevent potentially policy-violating predictions from appearing”and that the company“would never modify our products or enforce our policies in any way to promote or disadvantage any particular political ideology, viewpoint or candidate.” However, accusations of liberal bias at Google are rife. After the killing of George Floyd triggered nationwide riots, a document circulated via company email instructing employees on effective means of protests, with one of its instructions being for staff to“debrief afterwards with resist@google.com”to discuss what could be“improved for next time.” The Silicon Valley giant also“blacklists”conservative and“fringe”websites from its search results, according to onereport, while anotherstudyfound that Google’s search results display a“left-leaning ideological skew.”This apparent skew is endorsed by the higher-ups at Google, who in a company meeting following the election of President Donald Trumpvowedto deploy artificial intelligence to prevent such a“deeply offensive”result from happening again.

"1 Sep, 2020",The ‘Oxford Black Panther’ behind Britain’s first black-led political party vows to make white men ‘our slaves’,"Sasha Johnson, a BLM leader, has set up a new party that will exclude white people from leadership roles and tweeted about ‘enslaving whites’. She’s just a young, female, black version of old white racists she says she’s fighting. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Another day has dawned in Britain, and with it yet another ridiculous demand from the intersectional left. During a Million Person March (attended, er, by around400people) in London, a BLM leader announced they would be forming the first black-led political party in Britain. This party will be called theTaking the Initiative Party(TTIP), which as names go makes Change UK look like a triumph of branding. Catchy names used to at least be something lefties could manage, the Khmer Rouge, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, the Tooting Popular Front etc., but I digress. Though this party will be “black led,” it will be a party for the “working class,” so quite why the racial aspect is necessary if this is a class-based movement is anybody’s guess, but it probably has something to do with the person who announced its formation. The TTIP was revealed to the world by a lady named Sasha Johnson. According to a vomit inducingly obsequious interview with a YouTube channel calledOxfordshire Youth, Sasha is an“amazing youth worker, freedom fighter, activist and business owner.”Apparently not content with those accolades, she also unironically calls herself“Oxford’s Black Panther.”She doesn’t explicitly say whether by that she means she is a fictional superhero from Wakanda or a member of the Marxist Black Power organisation from the US, but based on her preference for a beret over a Vibranium catsuit, we can assume the latter. Sasha has had an eventful few months since the blacklivesmatter movement kicked off again. As a result of this she says she has become a“symbol of the revolution.”So, what kind of revolution is this pound shop Che Guevara planning? Well, a communist one, obviously, but one with a healthy side of racial supremacy to go with the Marxism. Ms Johnson first came to national attention a few weeks ago after she was filmed repeatedly calling a black man who didn’t believe that the UK was a systemically racist country a“coon,”apparently threatening him with violence, then taking exception with him for“calling a black woman angry”after she explicitly said she was. The unedifying exchange can be seenhere. Another video shows her done up like Wolfie Smith and calling for the establishment of a“Black Militia”in the UK. During an incoherent attempt at rabble rousing, she says that capitalism is only possible off the back of racism, claims that the police are no different from the KKK but also need to start litter picking for the council, and dismisses David Lammy, Sadiq Khan and Priti Patel as“tokenistic.”There then follows an embarrassing call and response section where she leads chants of“no justice, no peace,”“take it to the streets, f*** the police,”“black power”and“one solution, revolution.” The whole thing is painfully cringe making, mainly because of how lacklustre the crowd are, but also for the ridiculous American imagery that doesn’t translate to Britain. This is Oxford, not Oakland, and it’s as embarrassing as hearing an accountant from Hampshire say fanny-pack or trash-can. However, theclip is worth watchingjust to see how uncomfortable the white woman in her entourage looks when she gives the Black Power salute. But what has riled Johnson into this revolutionary zeal? Well, in her own words it was the“massacre”and“assassination”of George Floyd. Quite why a death in America warrants a revolution in Britain is a mystery to me, but Johnson is quite adamant about it. It also isn’t immediately obvious why communism will solve racism, but she is equally steadfast on that position, despite being a business owner. She runs acaféin Oxford selling food from the Island and the Motherland, which one assumes means Jamaica and Africa, although it isn’t expressly stated. I’m no communist, but I’m fairly certain owning a business puts you in the bourgeoisie rather than the proletariat. So, what of this new party, the TTIP? Well, in her own words:“We are tired of being let down by Labour, Conservatives, and Lib-Dem and all of them. We want our own political party, one that reflects the multicultural nation that we have become.”The fact that the last election saw the most BAME MPs ever elected won’t do for Sasha, as all these people are “Uncle Toms” to her. It also appears that this new party won’t be much of a fan of Britain, given that at the same event where she announced it, protesters were carrying a blood-stained Union Jack. Even Johnson’s claims for wanting “equality” seem not to hold up to scrutiny or fall into a distinctly Orwellian outcome of some people being more equal than others. Her Twitter account has recently been suspended after shepinned a tweetto her profile which read:“The white man will not be our equal but our slave. History is changing. No justice, no peace #BLM.” There is little doubt that had the roles been reversed, and a prominent member of the EDL or Britain First had tweeted that black people would be“slaves,”the Old Bill would have been knocking on their door the second they hit send. Johnson is a black supremacist and is apparently finding it increasingly hard to disguise her disgust for white people and“race traitors”from the black community. The fact that blacklivesmatter UK has not denounced her blatant racism and inflammatory language does the movement no favours. Oxford’s Black Panther seems to have little in common with the hero of the movie T’Challa (excellently played by the dearly departed Chadwick Boseman) and have a view of the world much more akin to the villain of the piece, Killmonger, who wants to use Wakanda’s technology to wreak havoc on the white west. The left can try and argue that racism is about systems and power structures all they like, but the rest of us know it is hatred of another race. Johnson plainly hates white people and the mere fact that she is black should not give her a free pass. She can dress up as Che Guevara all she likes, but in reality, she’s nowhere near as glamorous as the Argentine revolutionary; she’s a black, female Nick Griffin with even less charisma.

"1 Sep, 2020",British universities’ mass-produced ‘anti-racism’ statements show they care more about activism than education,"Since the death of George Floyd, dozens of British universities have published “anti-racism” statements. This is yet another indication that disinterested truth-seeking is giving way to activism in UK higher education. ByNoah Carl, an independent researcher based in the UK. Follow him on Twitter@NoahCarl90 As the American psychologist Jonathan Haidt hasargued, the true purpose or ‘telos’ of universities is the disinterested pursuit of truth. They are meant be places where assumptions are always questioned, and evidence is always demanded. But in recent years, they have begun to assume a second, rather different role: the not-at-all disinterested pursuit of ‘social justice’. Of course, achieving ‘social justice’ doesn’t mean something anodyne like ‘trying to make the world a better place’, which all except the most hardline nihilists could get on board with. Instead, it refers to a specific ideology which sees identity groups like sex and race as the primary units of society; which attributes to some groups the status of victims and to others the status of oppressors; and which posits that various ‘structural’ and ‘systemic’ forces stymie members of the former groups while conferring ‘privilege’ on members of the latter. The latest example of British universities’ commitment to social justice ideology is the sudden publication of dozens of ‘anti-racism’ statements in the weeks following the death of George Floyd. Such statements have been published by:Oxford,Cambridge,Edinburgh,St Andrews,UCL,Imperial,Durham,Warwick,Bath,Exeter,Nottingham,Kent,Coventry,Westminster,De Montfort,Brighton,Keeleand many others. A few of the statements are short, each comprising an obligatory reminder that – in case you were in doubt – the senior management happens to be against racism. Most, however, are somewhat longer, and contain not only reassurances concerning the senior management’s opposition to racism, but also an acknowledgement of“persistent racial inequality”and a commitment to“address systemic racism,”particularly within the university itself. Many of the statements mention the authors’ distress over the death of George Floyd, and some explicitly declare support for the blacklivesmatter movement. For example, De Montfort University’s statementproclaimsthat“DMU absolutely stands against racism and supports the values and ethos of blacklivesmatter .”This could be regarded as a slightly contentious thing for a publicly-funded university to say, given that the leaders of said movement havedescribedthemselves as“trained Marxists”and haveexpressedtheir desire to“dismantle capitalism”and abolish prisons. But I suppose universities can’t be expected to look into every organisation they declare their support for. Many of the statements also explicitly link the death of George Floyd to the issue of racism, thereby giving credence to the claim that Floyd was intentionally killed by four racist police offers (i.e., not merely that he was murdered, but that his killers were motivated by racial animus). While this claim may turn out to be true (we do not yet have all the facts), it would seem prudent – especially for an institution that is supposedly engaged in the pursuit of truth – to withhold judgement on such a contentious issue until the matter can be settled definitively. Indeed,variouscommentatorshavearguedagainst the narrative of systematic bias or racism in police shootings. One thing that becomes obvious when reading these statements is how eerily similar they are. (Key words and phrases from the ‘woke’ lexicon appear in almost all of them.) I don’t know if a ‘University Anti-Racism Statement Generator’ exists, but – if not – there is now surely enough training data for someone to construct one. Each statement reads like an awkward collaboration between a professor of critical race theory and corporate PR executive, which – as a matter of fact – is probably how much university bureaucracy is administered in the current year. As to why so many universities have concurrently decided to publish ‘anti-racism’ statements, one possibility that had occurred to me is that they all retain the services of the same London PR company. Another, perhaps more likely possibility is that once a small number of universities had published statements, the rest panicked and realised they had to make one of their own, so as not to end up looking like the only institution that doesn’t care about injustice. What is most bizarre about the statements, however, is the fact that universities decided to publish them at all. There are myriad injustices going on all around the world, but we don’t expect universities to issue official statements on each one. Why have universities not commented on the persecution of the Uyghurs? Why have they not commented on the civil war in Yemen? Why have they not commented on the Boko Haram insurgency? Since universities have not condemned any of these injustices, are we to assume that they don’t care about them? According to the University of Bath’sstatement,“We stand in solidarity with our Black students, staff and wider community.”Do they not also stand in solidarity with their students affected by all the other injustices in the world? Since they have not explicitly said so, we can only assume they don’t. Issuing official statements condemning things has not generally been seen as one of universities’ roles. The most plausible reason why so many of them decided to comment in this particular case is that they were under pressure from social justice activists, who wish to further theirprojectof ‘decolonising’ the academy. Consistent with this theory, a number of the anti-racism statements make grand promises concerning how the university intends to change going forward. For example, the University of Warwick’sstatement, after thanking“Black students and staff and those of colour, who have given their time and emotional labour to share their own stories (often repeatedly) to educate the many of us who need educating,”outlines eight specific actions that the university will undertake. These include funding“SU’s Warwick Decolonise Project”and setting up a“Race Equality Taskforce.” Perhaps the most ambitious proposals are thoselaid outby Keele University. According to the university’s statement,“It is not enough to be non-racist, to try to eliminate racism from our community and campus […] We have to become an anti-racist institution, one that makes a full contribution to the struggle against the pandemic of racism which has infected our societies for centuries.”It goes on to say that“this will require an all-institution effort involving all staff and all students.” Since George Floyd died in police custody earlier this year, British universities have been tripping over themselves to show how much they care about racial injustice. However, this isn’t what universities are supposed to be for. It’s about time they left the anti-racist activism to someone else, and got back to doing the things we actually expect of them – teaching students, supporting research and encouraging debate.

You must vote in November. Just to be clear, Trump supporters have murdered three more people in a week than Antifa has in its existence. WAKE UP! President Trump is inciting this violence so that he can implement the Insurrection Act right before the election and send the military into Democratic cities to tear-gas voters who he will refer to as “ANTIFA.”#TrumpRiots Only a day before the shooting, Joe Biden blasted President Trump for suggesting multiple times that cities like Portland and Kenosha need federal assistance, calling ongoing demonstrations“peaceful”protests, leading Donald Trump Jr. and others to deem the violent protests“#BidenRiots”following Saturday’s shooting. “In Democrat-run cities across the country, innocent people are being murdered, communities are being burned to the ground, small businesses are being destroyed & Joe Biden refuses to stand up to his radical supporters causing the mayhem,”hetweeted. The president renewed his call for the National Guard to be deployed to Portland on Sunday morning, an idea Mayor Ted Wheeler has officially rejected before.

"29 Aug, 2020",Democrats have directly encouraged violence on the streets. Winding it back isn’t going to be easy,"Protests and riots have spiraled out of control in the US. However, these aren’t spontaneous demonstrations. Instead they’re egged on by Democrats, who seem hell-bent on burning America to the ground. To those fed a diet of mainstream media disinformation, the protests sweeping the US are just that: protests. They’re grassroots affairs, expressions of discontent and resentment at a status quo that oppresses African Americans and denies them the rights and privileges afforded to whites. That may have been true for all of about a day following the death of George Floyd back in May, and some of the protesters no doubt still feel that they’re fighting the good fight. But far more have taken to the streets to commit brazen acts of violence, looting, and criminality. Thousands have been injured, and more than 32 people have been killed, including the two shot in apparent self-defense by teenager Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha on Tuesday night. The riots have been enabled by Democrat leaders who have at best excused and at worst encouraged the most base excesses of the mob. The mob’s latest target was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Paul and his wife were accosted by a screaming crowd of rioters outside the Republican National Convention in Washington, DC on Thursday night. Explaining the event to Fox News on Friday, Paul said that“had they gotten at us they would have gotten us to the ground, we might not have been killed, might just have been injured by being kicked in the head, or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless.” If any Democrat can claim credit for inspiring violent street harassment, it’s California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Back in 2018, Waters told her supporters that if they come across an ally of President Donald Trump in public,“you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they re not welcome anymore, anywhere.” As you watch all the videos of Trump supporters getting targeted and attacked outside the White House tonight, here’s a reminder that one of the Democrats’ leading voices, Maxine Waters, literally encouraged this behavior.pic.twitter.com/v5o4bxWpKO Her supporters followed her words to the letter,harassing and threateningRepublican officials on the streets and in restaurants throughout that summer. However, the violence has since escalated, just as the rhetoric has. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley – a member of the so-called ‘Squad’ and media darling –calledlast week for mobilized“unrest on the streets”against the Trump administration. Way back in June, as Minneapolis and Portland burned, Kamala Harris, now Joe Biden’s running mate, warned the public that the riots are“a movement”that’s“not gonna stop.” Kamala Harris says that the riots are not going to stop, ever, and to BEWARE. With a smile on her face.pic.twitter.com/xkwAUOMJcL “Everyone beware,”Harris exclaimed.“They’re not gonna stop before election day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after election day. They’re not gonna let up and they should not.” A good friend of mine once called the American left wing the“Interahamwe Left.”Given the events of recent months, the comparison is apt. The Interahamwe were a Hutu political movement in the Rwanda of the early 1990s, and helped perpetrate a sickening genocide against the country’s Tutsi minority. Immediately before the butchery began in 1994, a Hutu radio station put out a cryptic broadcast:“Cut down the tall trees.”Hutus across the country took up rifles and machetes and slaughtered an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsis in the course of three months. The genocide was merciless, with neighbor killing neighbor in villages, schools, and churches. That broadcast came after a year of anti-Tutsi radiomessaging, during which Hutu spokesmen ginned up hatred against the Tutsi. Just like the Hutus did in Rwanda, the American left has shut off all avenues for rapprochement and reconciliation. Just look at theharassmentof anyone who refuses to prostrate themselves before the woke mob. Then look at the barbarism that leftist mouthpieceswish upontheir enemies. While it’s true that street violence is a world away from systematic execution, the messaging of the American left is in some way similar. Except the Democratic Party doesn’t need to cloak its message in the poetic euphemisms of the Interahamwe. Instead they simply instruct their street fighters to go out and raise hell. Not a single prominent Democrat has issued a clear and unequivocal denunciation of the violence. Joe Biden meekly pleaded with the mob this week to show some restraint, but that only came about after a marked drop in his polling numbers. It’s unlikely that they’d listen anyway. If they were open to reason, the crowd shouting“Breonna Taylor”at Rand Paul would realize that Paul actuallytried to passthe Justice for Breonna Taylor Act in the Senate earlier this summer. The Act would have banned“no-knock”warrants, like the kind Louisville Police Department were serving when they shot Taylor dead in March. But the crowd has gotten a taste for violence, and long since abandoned reason. Biden, Harris and the Democratic Party likely saw opportunity in the blacklivesmatter movement. They could praise the protesters in the streets, using the images of thousands of marching demonstrators to highlight the failings of the Trump administration. They could even close their eyes and let the rioters loose as their unofficialTonton Macoutes, terrorizing political opponents. However, even with these boogeymen affecting Democratic poll numbers, it is unlikely that Biden’s wheedling will calm them down. They’ve been fed too much encouraging agitprop for that. Should Biden and Harris manage to win this November, Harris might get exactly what she asked for. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/499374-democrats-encourage-riot-violence/

"28 Aug, 2020",‘Taking a step back’: NHL follows NBA & postpones playoffs in protest over Jacob Blake shooting at players’ request,"The National Hockey League (NHL) has followed the NBA’s lead and put games on hold until at least Saturday, saying that the move was meant to honor the victims of police shootings, such as Jacob Blake and George Floyd. “After much discussion, NHL players believe that the best course of action would be to take a step back and not play tonight’s and tomorrow’s games as scheduled,”the NHL said in a joint statement with the franchise’s players association, the NHLPA. The league said that the four games affected by the move would be played starting Saturday. The playing schedule, disrupted by the pause, will be adjusted“accordingly,”it noted. The NHL said that it believes“much work”is to be done for the league to take on“an appropriate role”in the debate on“diversity, inclusion and social justice.” We understand that the tragedies involving Jacob Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others require us to recognize this moment. We pledge to work to use our sport to influence positive change in society The move to put off the games scheduled for Thursday and Friday mirrors that of the NBA, which announced that no players would hit the court on Thursday either, as a boycott in the name of social justice continued into a second day. While many have applauded the league’s decision to follow in the footsteps of basketball bosses and side with the players, critics of the decision argued that in rallying behind the victims of police shootings,“millionaire athletes”seemingly overlooked the plight of dozens of small business owners, who had their stores torched and ransacked during the riots spawned by the police shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday. It is nice to see how the millionaire athletes are reaching out and standing with the small business owners across this country who’s lives have been upended and possibly destroyed over the senseless riots and looting too. 🤥🤥🤥🤥 @NHLwalking in lockstep with the mob.

Say what you will about the NBA, NHL, and MLB, but it was really thoughtful of them to clear the decks tonight so everyone could watch Trump s speech at the RNC instead of sports.

"28 Aug, 2020","Widow of retired police officer David Dorn, slain during BLM riots, to speak at RNC as Dems lose ground on lawlessness issue","The widow of retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn, who was shot to death in June during a violent blacklivesmatter protest, could become the most important voice among Thursday’s Republican National Convention speakers. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. That’s because Ann Dorn will broach and humanize a subject that has emerged as perhaps the most troubling issue facing Democrats heading into November’s election: law and order. Dorn will talk about the horrible pain she has suffered as a result of her 77-year-old husbandbeing murderedwhile trying to protect a friend’s pawnshop from rioters. She will offer the additional perspective of a current law enforcement officer, as she’s also a St. Louis police sergeant. Her words will call attention to the escalating violence and criminality that has occurred since protests broke out across the nation in the wake of Minneapolis black man George Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have successfully turned that issue against Democrats, who for months have tried to downplay and ignore the mayhem. It’s one of the biggest reasons that Trump’sapproval ratingshave risen in recent weeks. Support for Trump got another boost with this week’s deadly protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a black man was shot in the back seven times by police on Sunday. CNN host Don Lemon acknowledged the political problem on Wednesday, saying the riots are“ablind spotfor Democrats.”Lemon suggested that lawlessness is the one issue that could torpedo Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden’s chances of winning:“It’s showing up in the polls. It’s showing up in focus groups. It’s the only thing right now that is sticking.” Media outlets have posted articles critical of Ann Dorn’s speech even before she speaks. Several of those pieces, including an International Business Times story on Thursday, citedDavid Dorn’s daughtersas saying they don’t want his widow to speak at the RNC.“It’s very frustrating because I know my dad did not agree with a lot of Trump’s policies or procedures,”said one of the daughters, Debra White. The other daughter, Lisa Dorn, was quoted as saying:“We don’t want his death or his legacy or any of his images to be used for political gain.” Another line of attack came in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial on Wednesday saying that Ann Dorn’s speech would miss the point. Trump has sought to blur the line between peaceful protests against racial injustice and opportunistic criminals who exploit such protests, the newspaper said. The widow also will fail to address thereal crisisthat contributed to David Dorn’s death, easy access to guns, the editorial added. Unfortunately for Democrats, as the focus groups cited by Lemon have shown, Americans are increasingly inclined to blame those who are committing the violence and those who are trying to look the other way.

"27 Aug, 2020", Fiery but mostly peaceful : CNN mocked for ridiculous caption of Kenosha riots destruction,"Online vigilantes lined up to spew vitriol at CNN and their reporter, who described the chaos in the riots-plagued Kenosha as “mostly peaceful” protests, while showing viewers exactly the opposite. CNN s Omar Jimenez went live from a troubled neighborhood in Kenosha, Wisconsin, telling viewers that protests – sparked by the death of African American Jacob Blake – were“largely peaceful”during the day, but that“things began to get a little bit more contentious”when night fell. As he spoke, buildings and vehicles burned in the background, with the scenes of destruction and chaos running contrary to what the network captioned as“fiery, but mostly peaceful protests after police shooting.” The phrase “beyond parody” doesn’t begin to describe thispic.twitter.com/OboLcKiCR4 A cohort of online commentators quickly built up, expressing anger and frustration over the tone of the coverage and its language.“Is that like, deadly, but mostly enjoyable car accidents?

Back in May, MSNBC host and Emmy nominee Ali Velshi faced an avalanche ofonline criticismwhen he was reporting live from a burning neighborhood in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where George Floyd was killed. When you think CNN couldn’t get worse, they never fail to amaze me At the time, Velshi described the unrest as“not, generally speaking, unruly,”drawing parallels with Jimenez reporting. Striking a more emollient tone, some people wondered if the infamous CNN banner was the result of a foul play. First the appearance and dissapearance of the word violent from CNN s screen last night, and now this absurdity.At this point, I m *seriously* questioning if CNN has a secret Trump supporter technician working on their chyrons. Sarcasm aside, the Wisconsin city of Kenosha has been on fire for several days in a row, with rioters defying a police curfew and hurling projectiles at local businesses and law enforcement buildings. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers had to call in the National Guard to quash the unrest, but furniture shops, car lots, correctional facilities and random vehicles were burnt to the ground.

"27 Aug, 2020",Minnesota governor calls in National Guard as looters tear up Minneapolis over rumors of police shooting (VIDEOS),"Governor Tim Walz has mobilized the Minnesota National Guard in response to widespread looting in Minneapolis, reportedly sparked by false allegations that the city’s police had shot and killed a black man earlier in the day. Restaurants, shops, and other businesses were vandalized and robbed in Minneapolis hours after a murder suspect shot himself after being confronted by police. A rumor spread alleging that the man had been killed by law enforcement officers, leading to rioting in the city, according to reports. Citing the chaos in downtown Minneapolis, Waltz declared a ‘peacetime emergency’ and said he was sending guardsmen, including a military police unit, to help “restore order” in the city. Additionally, the Minnesota State Patrol deployed around 150 troopers to help local police disperse the rioters and prevent further looting. The National Guard and state police deployments came after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew and requested assistance from the governor. Photographs and videos show widespread destruction and looting in the city’s downtown area on Wednesday night.

Once again, a Black man — Jacob Blake — was shot by the police. In front of his children. It makes me sick.Is this the country we want to be?Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice.pic.twitter.com/WdNqrxA3PK As Kenosha is bracing itself for a potential fourth night of violent unrest that has already seen numerous local businesses ransacked and torched, Biden released a video statement, urging protesters to stop destroying their own communities. Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence – violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community The chaos in Kenosha has alreadycosttwo people their lives. Biden s admission that it was a far cry from a peaceful blacklivesmatter rally came shortly after prominent CNN host Don Lemon opined that, by keeping quiet on the crisis, Democrats risk losing the demographics the former VP needs to have on board in the November election. “It’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups,”Lemon said, speaking to fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo on Tuesday evening. In the rare criticism of the Democratic party, Lemon said that it was“ignoring this problem or hoping it will go away,”adding that neither appears to be happening any time soon. The timing of Biden’s statement was not lost on conservatives, suggesting that he was moved by his polling numbers rather than by the plight of the businesses he referred to in his message when he took aim at rioters and looters. “I noticed that CNN said your polls were probably down because of the rioting. I’m guessing that’s why you finally mentioned about rioting and the violence being wrong. I think it was Lemon that said it,”a commenter said.

Support for the blacklivesmatter movement has also fallen by 10 points, to 49 percent, while support for the police has increased and only 17 percent of respondents agree with defunding police departments – a core demand of some BLM activists and Democratic politicians. While parts of Kenosha have been almost reduced to scorched earth in the three days following the Sunday shooting of black man Jacob Flake by police, violence has also marred the protests against police brutality for three months in the wake of the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody in late May.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said last month that it had arrested 13 individuals who allegedly set fires in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The bureau was investigating more than 150 fires.

Andrew Dickensis an award-winning writer on culture, society, politics, health and travel for major titles such as the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Independent, the Daily Mail and Empire. There’s a saying that goes, “a bad apple spoils the bunch.” Sometimes “bunch” is replaced by “barrel,” but that’s not really important right now.  It’s one of the most depressing phrases in the English language, because it means some idiot or idiots are ruining something good that they’re part of. Which brings me to a couple of videos that have spread rapidly across social and mainstream media this week. They show groups of blacklivesmatter supportersverbally haranguing and physically intimidating peoplewho refuse to ‘raise a fist’ in solidarity with the cause. One of these, a woman, is reportedly a BLM supporter who has been on marches against racism and police brutality. 1) In a scene that played out several times Monday, a blacklivesmatter protest that began in Columbia Heights confronted White diners outside D.C. restaurants, chanting “White silence is violence!” and demanding White diners show their solidarity.#DCProtestspic.twitter.com/fJbPM76vb0 I need to make two things clear before I get to my point: I think blacklivesmatter is a much-needed and noble cause. The people doing the harassing are dicks. It is actually possible for one person to hold these two views simultaneously, though you wouldn’t think so amid the absolutist universe of online discourse. It’s like people thinking that having a police force is generally a good thing, but that those police officers harassing, beating and, of course, murdering innocent people – particularly when it’s based on the colour of their skin – are a blight on humanity. I think the people in those videos are dicks for a number of reasons. First, it’s clearly dickish behaviour to gang up on someone and chant or shout in their face because they won’t do what you want them to. It’s bullying, which is one of the things they’re supposed to be fighting against. Secondly, it doesn’t work. You can’t change someone’s mind through coercion. You might change their behaviour because they’re frightened, but you won’t alter their views – at least, not in the way you’d like to. It’s like training a dog by beating it with a stick; it still wants to bark or jump up, it’s just petrified of what will happen if it does. You can only change minds through education and conversation. Or, in the case of the dog, roast chicken. But perhaps the most depressing element is the damage bad apples do to people’s perceptions. I hate to say it, but we live in an age where ‘brand’ is king, and perceptions of brands are heavily influenced by mainstream and social media. I don’t buy the notion of blacklivesmatter as an organisation. It’s a slogan that represents an idea. There isan organisation with that name, of course, but it’s not some all-powerful activist network manipulating the millions of BLM protesters around the world – no matter what some people try to tell you. However, even as a slogan, as an idea, blacklivesmatter still has a ‘brand’. And like any brand, it can be tarnished, become toxic. Our world is image-led, and the most impactful images are the ones that get noticed, get remembered and get splashed across all forms of media. From online alt-right agitators to ‘progressive’ campaigners and mainstream newspapers, they’ll always share the juiciest, most clicky content. And it doesn’t matter if these images aren’t representative; they will alter perceptions – and they will be used to alter perceptions. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, the vast majority of protests were peaceful, but people with an anti-BLM agenda (which often translates as an anti-black agenda) used footage of an idiot minority looting and rioting to make it look very different, sharing it with comments like “so-called peaceful protest.” People don’t even have to have an agenda for this stuff to affect how a movement, organisation or person is perceived. They’ll share it because it’s what they’re most likely to see. Because it’s what everyone is sharing. This is why the people in those videos are dicks. Not just because of their actions, but because they fail to realise the consequences of those actions. I’m all for civil disobedience. I’m all for protest. I understand the rage in some people. Many actions are forgivable. But acting like this plays into the hands of critics – into the hands of racists – by making the BLM ‘brand’ toxic in the eyes of people who can’t, or don’t want to, see the bigger picture. Rightfully or wrongfully, it gives them an ‘out’ to use. You see it everywhere: “I did have sympathy, but after seeing these videos, I don’t.” Yes, that’s a bit pathetic, but it’s the way things are. Castigating people in the street, and more importantly on camera, isn’t a recruitment tool – it’s a PR disaster. If enough bad apples end up on enough screens, people will be turned off and a good cause will be harmed. And this cause can’t afford for that to happen.

Toronto Raptors discussed BOYCOTTING playoff matches over Jacob Blake shooting,"The Toronto Raptors have discussed boycotting Game 1 of the NBA second-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics to protest against the shooting of Jacob Blake by Wisconsin police. On Tuesday the team held a meeting to discuss how they can react to the widely-discussed case of Blake, a 29-year-old unarmed black man who was shot in the back by a policeman on Sunday.

Toronto Raptors Masai Ujiri releases footage of deputy sheriff initiating assault after NBA Finals Blake s father said that his son was shot seven times while trying to enter a car when three of his children were present. Video of the accident recorded from a window across the street was widely shared on social media, producing a bombshell effect in the US, with many NBA players raising questions about whether the playoff games should be held at all. “We knew coming here or not coming here was not going to stop anything, but I think ultimately playing or not playing puts pressure on somebody,” Raptors guard Fred VanVleetsaid. The question of holding the NBA games preceded the 2020 Bubble opening last month, with many players, led by Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, speaking out against resuming the championship, saying it could distract people from nationwide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. In the wake of Flyoyd’s death, large-scale protests swept across the country, with many athletes from different sports kneeling during the national anthem to protest against apparent police brutality. If the Raptors boycott the upcoming play-off game they will bring the blacklivesmatter movement to a brand new level, as a team’s protest could affect TV broadcast schedules, the outcome of the game and sponsors’ interests.

"25 Aug, 2020",CBS News whitewashes Kenosha destruction as mostly peaceful protests as city smolders in aftermath,"To some in the mainstream media, the wave of arson and destruction that swept over Kenosha, Wisconsin was nothing more than “peaceful protest” that “gave way to clashes.” Don’t believe your lying eyes, they may as well have said. The Wisconsin city of Kenosha burned for a second night in a row on Monday, as rioters defied a police curfew and torched local businesses and law enforcement buildings. Some were armed, and even as Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called in the National Guard, furniture shops, car lots, correctional facilities, and random vehicles were razed to the ground by the mob. That’s not quite how CBS News saw it though. According to anchor Gayle King on Tuesday, the riots began as“peaceful protests, which is what the blacklivesmatter is really about.” “It’s not clear if those setting fires were involved in the initial demonstrations,”King said. Yet as she described blacklivesmatter ’s supposedly peaceful methods, CBS played scenes of vehicles engulfed by fire, crowds jumping on cars, and businesses still smoldering from the night’s anarchy. A second day of peaceful protests gave way to clashes overnight in Wisconsin.This comes after 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back by police as he tried to get into his car. He remains hospitalized in stable condition.@MolaReportshas the latest.pic.twitter.com/4Ljb0hZFq0 According to King, the protests spontaneously“gave way to clashes”as night fell. Reporter Mola Lenghi further appeared to excuse the destruction, telling viewers that“setting this truck on fire right here behind me is how some protesters have responded to the authorities’ use of stun grenades, [and] of tear gas.” By Tuesday morning, hours of video footage from Kenosha circulated online, showing that the protests were anything but peaceful. HOLY SH*#: while interviewing this#BLMrioter in Kinosha he pulls out a real pistol and points it at my camera while explaining what we would do to cops if they rolled up on us right now It’s been a while since I had a gun pointed at me even if it was just to make a pointpic.twitter.com/hjQqO9Ccbb Kenosha earlierpic.twitter.com/8Q0kPC94mD CBS instead focused on the event that triggered the riots – the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake on Sunday. Blake was shot in the back seven times by officers as he attempted to get into his car, collapsing in front of his children. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times that Blake is now paralyzed from the waist down. The network wasn’t alone in whitewashing the riots. The New York Times alsodescribedMonday’s events as“peaceful marches”that“gave way to fires and destruction.”On CNN, a banner described the protests as“fiery but mostly peaceful.” The latest conflagration in Kenosha isn’t the first riot to be given the“peaceful protests”treatment by the media. As the first wave of blacklivesmatter protests hit Minneapolis in May after the police killing of George Floyd, MSNBC’s Ali Veshi reassured viewers that the scene was“not generally speaking, unruly.”As Veshi spoke, abuilding burnedimmediately behind him. When anarchists occupied Seattle’s Capitol Hill district two weeks later, the Seattle Times described the short-lived ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone’ as a“loose, egalitarian”paradise of“free snacks,” “free of uniformed police.”In reality, the zone was a lawless place, where vigilante justice reigned, thieves profited, and by the end of June, four peoplewere shot, two fatally. The disconnect between narrative and reality was noticed on Twitter, where conservatives mocked CBS’ friendly coverage of the Kenosha riots.“You could describe D Day as a peaceful boat trip across the English Channel that gave way to clashes on the beach,”one commenterjoked. “Peaceful...gave way to clashes” No, thugs and lunatics engaged in riots, arson, and looting- which everyone was expecting- because the mainstream media is full of cowards who pay for their houses in the Hamptons by running cover for BLM criminality on behalf of the DNChttps://t.co/EuOULtjd5f Read the tweet then watch the footagehttps://t.co/9VD9l7Fb4S ",https://www.rt.com/usa/499004-kenosha-peaceful-protest-cbs/

He got into a fight with a group of people and later sped off, daring them to come for his business. Said people shouldn’t be destroying their own neighborhoods:pic.twitter.com/3O4FFmLnY8 His efforts were seemingly in vain, however, as one of the alleged“protesters”called out the name of the do-gooder s business, written on the side of his truck, and gleefully proclaimed,“We ll burn your store down too!” Kenosha is the latest flashpoint of racially charged, anti-police violence to sweep the US, with tensions having already erupted in many cities, including Seattle and Portland, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in May.

"23 Aug, 2020","Western celebs & politicians are falling over themselves to condemn racism, yet, Russophobia & Sinophobia remain acceptable","Censorship is democracy, fake news is truth, submission is freedom. Western propaganda requires acceptance of contradictory dogmas alongside an impressive array of mental gymnastics to reconcile logical fallacies. George Orwell’s novel ‘1984’ depicts life within Oceania, a totalitarian society strictly controlled by an omnipresent Party whose three simple yet contradictory slogans are: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength. Citizens of Oceania were forced to accept that two plus two may equal five if the Party deemed it so. Akin to the Snakegamefound on old Nokia mobile phones, woke movements become increasingly illogical and harder to control before eventually tying themselves in knots or crashing into the walls of logic, sowing the seeds of their own destruction. Modern feminist movements are having the wind taken out of their sails by other woke factions who argue that children should be taught boys can haveperiods, so as not to distress transgender students, or thattermslike mother and father should be replaced with parent 1 and parent 2. Even the main UK doctors’ union sent an internal memo advising its staff to use the term ‘pregnant people’ rather than ‘expectantmothers’to avoid causing offense. One could argue that campaigns designed to remove the concept of male and female is a threat to women and their historical struggles. By eliminating the ‘existence’ of women, it not only airbrushes out women’s vast contribution to history but also removes the whole notion of feminism – if womanhood does not exist, then the whole idea of misogyny becomes irrelevant. Perhaps one day someone will decide that race is simply a construct and can be changed at will, thus making all debates about racism and oppression irrelevant. Thus future woke cultists might argue themselves into a corner in which racism and thus ‘white privilege’ does not exist. In the West you are free to choose any gender or sexuality, transition between these at whim, or perhaps create your own, but you are not supposed to question the foundations of capitalism or liberalism. Likewise, the much lauded concept of human rights and democracy – one of the key pillars on which Western ‘cultural superiority’ rests and from which it sneers at ‘undemocratic’ and ‘uncivilised’ countries – is used to justify the destruction, occupation and economic enslavement of other peoples. Whether it is Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen or Palestine we see that non-white lives do not matter when there are no political points to score. Indeed, condemning the slaughter of Palestinians could be enough to get you labeled an anti-Semite by those who remain suspiciously silent when real anti-Semitism rears its ugly head. For example, far right and neo-nazi militias in Ukraine,someof whom take their symbols and ideology from the 1930-1940s,have operated with relative impunity and perpetuated human rights abuses upon the people of the Donbass region. These groups were part of the Maidan movement, visited by Western politicians and praised by liberals, that violently overthrew elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Some of the leaders of this movement included far right elements who had no qualms being amidst white power logos and neo-nazi flags, or had in the past claimed that a“Moscow-Jewish mafia”controlsUkraine.Neither Western nor Israeli politicians seemed too interested in such developments, despite Israeli newspaperHaaretzreporting that weapons sent by Israel to Ukraine were ending up in the hands of far right militias, such as the Azov battalion. Paradoxically, copious effort and resources were allocated to make people believe that the UK Labour Party, led by left wing leader Jeremy Corbyn, had a serious problem with anti-Semitism. As soon as a party leader like Jeremy Corbyn began to offer something outside the narrowly defined political bandwidth and stood up for the rights of Palestinians, he was demonized by politicians as well as their media allies and big business handlers. A study conducted by the London School of Economics and Political Science examined UK newspaper coverage of Corbyn in the months following his election as Labour Party leader and found evidence of mediabiassuch that“Corbyn was thoroughly delegitimised as a political actor from the moment he became a prominent candidate and even more so after he was elected as party leader, with a strong mandate.” It is welcome that recent events in the US have highlighted racism faced by African Americans. Yet frequent murders of African Americans by a militarized police force did not suddenly appear when Trump came to power. Many Democratic Party politicians who nowadays make sure everyone knows they unquestioningly support the blacklivesmatter movement had few issues with the status quo before the killing of George Floyd, and will probably regain their apathy if Biden wins the election. Furthermore, little is said about the role the Obama administration played only a few years ago in the destruction of Libya, formerly one of Africa’s richest and most stable nations, and its relinquishment to warlords and Al-Qaeda affiliated groups. Some of these groups were quick to imprison and murdercitizensfrom sub-Saharan Africa who had migrated to Libya in search of a better life.Slavemarkets selling sub-Saharan Africans now exist in the new post-Gaddafi Libya. The UK Conservative Party, traditionally not fans of refugees or migrants, were responsible for theWindrush scandalwhich saw Caribbean immigrants who had arrived in the UK decades earlier being threatened with deportation despite having lived, worked, and paid taxes in this country for many years. The same party is now thinking of allowing nearly three million Hong Kong citizens the opportunity to reside in the UK and later apply forcitizenship. When it comes to sticking two fingers up to China, we hear no talk about how the NHS and welfare system cannot afford to absorb refugees and migrants. These days many people, especially celebrities, politicians and media figures, are falling over themselves to condemn racism and make sure everyone is aware of their anti-racist credentials. The only remaining forms of racism deemed acceptable in the West include Russophobia and Sinophobia. The media devotes endless hours hyping up the threat from Russia and China and in doing so surreptitiously promotes animosity toward these nations and their peoples. The shadowy hand of the Russian government is deemed to be behind every calamity or undesired election result. We are frequently reminded that a vague and poorly defined threat from Russia and China looms large, though hard evidence is often sketchy, open to interpretation or questionable. At the same time NATO troops encroach upon Russia’s borders, yet the latter is deemed the aggressor, whilst the US sails warships through contested seas near China’sborders. Whereas the UK seeks to provoke Russia for no logical reason, the US is determined to pick a fight with China and claims it“chose not to”stop coronavirus from spreading beyond its borders. The waning US empire and its allies within the disintegrating EU prefer to attack their rivals Russia and China to deflect their own populations’ attention away from domestic problems with some good old-fashioned xenophobia. The UK, in particular, would do well to try and improve its relationships with Russia and China as it is on track to have a lonely time post Brexit.

The Chicago Police Department has ordered officers to bar protesters from Lightfoot’s Logan Square neighborhood and arrest any who refuse to leave, the Chicago Tribunereportedon Thursday, citing a recently surfaced police directive from July. Though the progressive Democrat mayor has frequently applauded“peaceful protests,”she argues the ban is needed for her own safety. “I think that residents of this city, understanding the nature of the threats that we are receiving on a daily basis – on a daily basis – understand I have a right to make sure that my home is secure,”Lightfoot told reporters when asked about the directive, though declined to outline any examples. I’m not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, I’m going to do everything I can to make sure they’re protected. I make no apologies whatsoever for that. Since a wave of mass demonstrations kicked off after the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement in Minneapolis, crowds of activists have gathered outside Lightfoot’s home on several occasions to protest against police brutality and department funding. Following one event in late July thatdrew hundredsto the neighborhood, however, police have largely kept demonstrators away, apparently enforcing the CPD directive. Through the weeks of unrest – which in Chicago has frequently descended intoriots and looting– Lightfoot has vacillated between support and vocal condemnation of protesters. In aleaked recordingof a conference call with city officials published in June, the mayor said Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez was“full of s**t”when he voiced concerns about violent protests reaching residential neighborhoods. Yet just one day prior, the mayor issued aharsh statementslamming protests that had“devolved into criminal conduct,”saying some activists showed up“armed for all-out battle”with police, though she has continued to encourage“peaceful”demonstrations since.

But despite a constant police presence around the mayor’s home, no arrests have been made on her block since the order was issued earlier this summer, with only two“public peace”violations reported there since July 21, according to city statistics cited by the Tribune.

"20 Aug, 2020",Tire ire: NASCAR s Trump 2020 car to stick with Goodyear tires despite US president s call to boycott brand,"The car bearing President Donald Trump s name on the NASCAR circuit has stated that it has no choice but to stick with Goodyear tires after Trump called for a boycott of the Ohio-based company on Wednesday. Corey LaJoie has driven the Trump 2020 car at numerous races this season, with it s MAGA-inspired decals coming as a result of a sponsorship deal between his team, Go Fas Racing, and a political action committee called Patriots of America which supports Trump s 2020 re-election campaign, and while he says he is generally supportive of Trump s policies, the deal that NASCAR has in place with Goodyear means that he has no choice to but use the brand which is currently in the White house doghouse. ""We just have one way to run them,"" Go Fas Racing general manager Mason St. Hilaire told US media. ""It’s either those tires or no tires. We don’t have much of a choice. There should be two. I don’t know if you should just have one. You’ve got to keep something for the competition, right? Putting another one in would probably be a little bit of fun, both for cost and competition."" Trump s ire at the tire brand can be traced to a re cent announcement in which they barred employees from wearing any political messaging at work in the lead-in to the US Presidential election in November, with The Donald s squarely framing the situation as a ban on his popular brand of red MAGA hats. Indeed, political messaging in opposition of the Trump administration was also outlawed. Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES - They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!). NASCAR has yet to comment on the situation. The car racing league also came under fire from some sections of its support earlier this year when a ban on fans flying confederate flags are their races was announced in the wake of the wave of blacklivesmatter protests following the death of George Floyd in May. It should also be noted that Trump s presidential limousine uses Goodyear tires. Who wants to tell him.pic.twitter.com/cMrvwxbpm1 NASCAR and Goodyear extended their partnership 2017, some 20 years after first linking and has become the most popular tire brand in the United States - and one of the most popular in the world. Goodyear is based in Akron, Ohio and employs almost 70,000 workers - around a thousand of which are US military veterans. Meanwhile, Go Fas Racing s St. Hilaire has expressed his reluctance at being central to an ongoing political debate. ""You’ve just got to look at all the information, I guess, you look at both sides,"" he said. ""It doesn’t look like whatever was out there on the internet came from corporate. It looks like maybe it was some sort of independent-type form that came out. It’s unfortunate. How does that even get out there? I feel bad for Goodyear to deal with this stuff with everything going on right now. In a competitive atmosphere, if you had two different ones, you’d play who’s stronger.""

In a graphic video, one of the attackers can be seen landing a running kick directly into Haner’s face, and police are now searching for this suspect. Haner apparently stopped his truck to come to the aid of a transgender womanbeing robbedby the mob, before the crowd turned on him. In a bizarre addition to the story, the New York Post on Wednesday ran astorydetailing Haner’s history of anti-BLM social media posts. Hours before he was beaten, Haner posted“George Floyd was a 46-year old felon, high on Fentanyl, and he got 4 televised funerals and 70 days of riots. What does 5-year old Cannon Hinnant get?”referring to awhite childshot in the head by his adult black neighbor in North Carolina a week ago.

So the fact that George Floyd was a violent dangerous felon high on meth and fentanyl and resisting arrest is completely irrelevant, but the fact that this guy posted a meme before he was knocked unconscious is relevant enough to warrant a headline about it. Makes sense.https://t.co/jWiwW1IAOj The Post also described how Haner posted an“All lives matter”image on his Facebook page, and one suggesting that rioters’ own homes should be burned down. However, Haner’s friends and supporters left him their own encouraging comments on these posts. “Sorry that the New York Post is trying to victim shame you for having political opinions after you were beaten within a hair of your life,”onewrote. The assault on Haner took place after more than 80 straight nights of rioting in Portland. Mayor Ted Wheeler has been criticized by the Right for failing to stamp out the lawlessness, despite insisting last month that the situation was under control and asking President Donald Trump to withdraw federal law enforcement agents from the city.

"16 Aug, 2020","Portland protesters hurl rocks at police on 80th night of BLM demonstrations, riot declared & 2 officers hospitalized (VIDEOS)","The 80th night of blacklivesmatter protests in Portland turned violent, with police declaring yet another riot as demonstrators threw rocks and projectiles at officers and their vehicles. Police said two cops were hospitalized. More than 200 people showed up to an anti-police brutality protest in East Portland on Saturday night. What began as peaceful demonstration later turned violent as protesters began moving into residential areas, throwing rocks and projectiles at police property and officers. Portland Police eventually declared the demonstration a riot early on Sunday, arresting several people as they tried to clear the area. Footage captured by RT s Ruptly video agency showed intense clashes, as police deployed smoke grenades against protesters who refused to comply with warnings to leave the area. According to a policestatement, two officers were hospitalized following Saturday night’s incidents, after both the cops were hit with a 10-pound rock. Police say the rock was thrown by an individual with clothing bearing the word“press.” During the clashes, some activists reportedly painted graffiti on the Penumbra Kelly Building, which is used by law enforcement. Police said another protester spray-painted over a security camera at the building. Antifa protesters also tried blocking a street at one point by holding makeshift shields in a line, but the amateur barricade was almost immediately torn apart by police.

Federal officers have begun leaving the city of Portland – though some remain to protect federal property – with the responsibility to keep protests peaceful now falling on city and state officials.

"16 Aug, 2020",America the elites ignore: Driving through US ‘flyover country’ in a time of Covid-19,"The establishment clustered in big coastal cities often derisively refers to the rest of the US as “flyover country.” It’s this area, though, that makes the beating heart of America – as I realized during a recent road trip. is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic is a Serbian-American journalist, blogger and translator, who wrote a regular column for Antiwar.com from 2000 to 2015, and is now senior writer at RT. Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Earlier this month, due to a tragic family event, my wife and I found ourselves on the road to Minnesota from Washington, DC. Normally we would fly, just like most Americans traveling across such distances, but there was no time to make those arrangements. So we drove 1,100 miles across eight states – and back again – within a week. Though the plural of ‘anecdote’ is not ‘data,’ those looking at America strictly through the lens of statistics and models tend to focus on the forest but miss the proverbial trees. With that in mind, here’s some of what we saw along the way. Make of it what you will. Whenever we’d get close to a city, the roads would fill up with vans and small trucks rented by movers. This would track with themounting evidencethat Americans who can afford it are picking up stakes. Whether it’s because of their city or state’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, job opportunities elsewhere, or the collapse of law and order in the wake of“racial justice”protests-turned-riots that broke out at the end of May, I can’t even venture to guess. On the long stretches of highway between cities, we spotted quite a few big trucks used for long-distance moves, too. These big rigs are the actual primary users of the US Interstate Highway System. The 18-wheeler tractor-trailers dominate the US cargo industry, carrying nearly two thirds of all freight. Moreover, most American businesses are structured around the idea of just-in-time delivery, rather than keeping stocks of unsold merchandise. That actually caused massive shortages of certain products at the start of Covid-19 lockdowns in March. Anything that gets in the way of the big rigs, then, spells bad news for the US economy. As we passed them on the road, I recalled a June report from awebsiteserving commercial drivers, saying that four out of five truckers polled would refuse to deliver to cities that defunded their police departments, citing safety concerns. Austin, Texas just voted to cut its police budget by a third. Another dozen cities havealready done so, from New York City and Los Angeles to Baltimore. Portland and Seattle, still plagued by rioters, have cut funding to their police as well. Minneapolis, where the most recent wave of blacklivesmatter protests began in late May over the death of George Floyd, actually voted to abolish its police department entirely! One doesn’t have to be particularly observant to spot a potential problem with this, barreling down the road like an out-of-control tractor-trailer. In most gas stations, restaurants and convenience stores we visited along the way, employees and customers dutifully wore face masks. A few people, locals by the look of them, seemed otherwise inclined. Nobody hassled them or made a scene. Halfway through Illinois, an older gentleman sitting across from us at a burger joint groused about the governor’s tyrannical mask mandates. He was diabetic, he said, so he needed to work out – but just quit his gym membership because they demanded he wear a mask while exercising indoors. His story reminded me of the ongoing saga of a New Jersey gym, which tried reopening in defiance of the governor’s orders, only for its owners to be arrested and their premises boarded up. Later I found out that the state took away their business license – just as Michigan did to a barber that reopened in defiance of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s orders, back in May. The barber was eventually vindicated by the state supreme court. The owners of Atilis Gym are still fighting their fight. Small business owners like these took the brunt of the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns. Others profited from them; many of the big rigs we saw along the way belonged to Amazon, whose stock has skyrocketed as physical stores closed and shopping moved online. Driving halfway across America and back – 2,200 miles, give or take – we saw some evidence of the sentiments along the way by the political signage put up alongside the roads. During the entire trip, we spotted exactly two signs supporting Joe Biden, and at least a dozen supporting President Donald Trump. They ranged from a cargo container parked next to the interstate and used as a canvas, to a hand-written cardboard sign posted at the entrance to a farm. Cars with Trump bumper stickers also vastly outnumbered the near-nonexistent Biden (or Clinton-Kaine) ones, so common in the greater Washington, DC area. More than one person we spoke with also joked that the pandemic will mysteriously vanish on November 4, the day after the election. Oh, the virus is real, they elaborated, but the media and the political establishment have overhyped it for partisan purposes. Looking back on this on Day 150 of“15 days to stop the spread,”I can see where they re coming from. What happens in parts of America we drove through largely doesn’t matter to the NY-LA-DC establishment. Even Minneapolis, where the George Floyd riots started, was quickly forgotten as the“cultural revolution”emerging from them went national. Only a few independent reporters, like Michael Tracey, actually bothered to travel to places devastated by the riots. I m finally home today after two months. A sincere thanks to everyone who made this trip a success!https://t.co/j4L1Heqdtf Yet it is these vast expanses that grow the food the coastal“elites”consume – once in pricey restaurants, now via  high-tech delivery. Though they have happily outsourced much of America’s manufacturing overseas – turning the once-proud industrial states into the Rust Belt – some things required for US global hegemony are still made in the Midwest; we drove past the sprawling M1-Abrams tank plant in Lima, Ohio. This relationship bears an uncanny resemblance to the attitudes of the Capitol toward the Districts in the ‘Hunger Games’ novels. Those were supposed to be a dystopian warning, however, not a roadmap. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/498058-america-roadtrip-flyover-country/
"15 Aug, 2020","‘Come on, don’t do this’: Yahoo slammed for shoddy story accusing RUSSIA of antifa.com prank of Joe Biden","The latest chapter in the conspiracy theory blaming Russia for ‘meddling’ in US elections accuses Moscow of somehow redirecting the website Antifa.com to Joe Biden’s website, thanks to some major internet illiteracy at work. On Wednesday, Republican activist Matthew Foldi pointed out that typing Antifa.com in one’s browser redirected to Biden’s campaign page, just as the Democrat candidate and his freshly chosen running mate Kamala Harris were about to do their first joint public appearance. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨GO TOhttps://t.co/0GjUAwwcXbRIGHT NOW!!!!! When a One America News correspondent at the White House asked President Donald Trump about it, however, that was a red flag for her Yahoo! News colleague Hunter Walker. To hear him tell it, OAN is a pro-Trump network that promotes“conspiracy theories”and employs someone who also works for Sputnik, which is“Russian propaganda.” So he looked into the internet records for Antifa.com and breathlessly reported it was“linked to – wait for it – Russia”!According to his article, the domain was“registered in the Russian Federation from 2013 through last July.” The Russian-linked ""antifa"" website that OAN brought up in the White House briefing used to feature a message encouraging people to ""join"" antifa. There was no contact info and the message just linked back to itself.https://t.co/UfCAMB0yjY Interestingly, that whole bit about OAN employing someone from Sputnik got MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow in hot water recently, and she had to argue that her showisn’t actually newsin order to dodge a defamation lawsuit over calling the network“really literally paid Russian propaganda.” In any case, Walker’s report was uncritically picked up and promoted by PropOrNot, a shadowy anonymous outfit notoriouslymisrepresentedby the Washington Post as experts on Russia and propaganda. According toMashable, however, the Yahoo story“substantially misunderstands”the archived history of the domain. The reason Russia turns up is because WhoisGuard, a privacy service, used a contractor based in St. Petersburg at the time. That alone“does not tell us anything about where the registrant is actually based,”Mashable added, conceding that Russia“could possibly be”behind the redirect, but there is“zero proof”of that. Wait, is this whole story and its claim about a link to Russia solely based on the fact that whoever first registeredhttps://t.co/gWkzvrn4Klused a Russian domain prviacy service? That’s it?! Come on, don t do this.https://t.co/zQfkS2oh9F BuzzFeed reporter Craig Silverman also slammed Walker’s article as shoddy, noting that it hinges solely on the fact that whoever registered antifa.com once used a Russian domain privacy service. “That’s it?! Come on, don t do this,”Silverman tweeted, adding,“Don t cite domain records if you don t know what they mean! Yahoo should retract this story.” Confronted with these findings, Walker stood by his claim, saying that“the little public info we have on this site that had an odd George Floyd protest message and popped up in the [White House] briefing is a link to Russia.” Of course, private registries don t definitively identify the owners but the little public info we have on this site that had an odd George Floyd protest message and popped up in the WH briefing is a link to Russia.https://t.co/UfCAMB0yjY Apparently anything can be a“link to Russia”these days – especially for Yahoo News, a major player in the ‘Russiagate’ conspiracy narrative. It was their chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff who famously first reported the existence of the ‘Steele dossier’, a collection of salacious claims about President Donald Trump and Russia compiled by British spy Christopher Steele for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. Isikoff later recanted about the Steele Dossier, but not before getting a sweet deal on a book about the“inside story of Putin’s war on America and the election of Donald Trump.” As for Walker, he seems to be afraid of so much as a shadow of anything Russian. Back in June he infamously refused to retweet a livestream of blacklivesmatter protests in Washington – after desperately searching for one – only because it came from Ruptly, which he warned his followers was“state owned Russian media.""

"13 Aug, 2020",Just HUSH it: Nike COVERED UP firing of employee who secretly filmed 50 men in restroom,"Nike fired an employee at an Oregon plant accused of filming male co-workers using the bathroom, but did nothing to notify the authorities, who were tipped off separately and found at least 50 men had been covertly recorded. Detectives learnt of the secret videos at a Nike plant in Beaverton during an unrelated investigation earlier this year, and found that 27-year-old Khoi Truong had surreptitiously filmed men in the restroom on his cell phone, according to a statement by the Washington CountySheriff’s Department. Nike fired Truong after two co-workers separately witnessed him recording them and notified their supervisors, in November 2017 and April 2018, respectively, the sheriff’s department said. However, neither Nike nor the employees affected reported Truong’s conduct to the police at the time of his firing. Truong was arrested on Wednesday and held in jail, with bail set at $100,000. A grand jury has indicted him on 10 counts of first-degree invasion of personal privacy. The sheriff’s department said investigators had worked with Nike to identify 23 victims so far, but dozens of additional men seen in the videos have yet to be identified. And the fact that the videos are now two to three years old won’t make the process any easier. There was no evidence that any hidden cameras were used, the sheriff’s department said. Reactions to the revelation on social media ranged from suggestions that employees should file a class-action suit against Nike to calls for a boycott against the company, which has outspokenly backed social justice issues in recent years. One poster opined that the gender of the victims allowed Nike to cover up the scandal, saying that, had it been women Truong had recorded, it would have called the police and alerted the media right away. So if it was a guy recording in a woman s bathroom@NIKEwould have insta called the cops and alerted the MSM... interesting how that works... & who the hell wants to watch a guy take a dump...w t f Nike has been a lightning rod for controversy over the years, including criticism for its use ofsweatshop labor, illegal payments to amateurathletesand divisive advertising. The company s decision to hire former kneeling NFL quarterback ColinKaepernickprompted some consumers not only to boycott the brand, but also to burn the Nike clothes and shoes they already own. The company was quick to take the side of blacklivesmatter protesters in the aftermath of Minneapolis black man George Floyd’s May 25 death in police custody, moralizing that viewers must quit turning their backs on racism.

"13 Aug, 2020",Pompeo feels insulted when quizzed about US crackdown on protesters at home after he bashed ‘authoritarian regimes’ for same,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took offense at the suggestion police abuse of protesters at home had anything in common with behavior he criticizes in “authoritarian regimes,” deeming the comparison “incomprehensible.” Asked during an interview Wednesday with Radio Free Europe whether the heavy-handed US response to protests “on its own turf” had “harmed America’s image” abroad, the American diplomat lashed out at the reporter, denouncing the question as “insulting.” “The difference between the US and these authoritarian regimes couldn’t be more clear,” Pompeo insisted, reminding his interviewer, “we have the rule of law, we have the freedom of press, and every one of [the protesters being arrested] gets due process.” To somehow suggest that America’s moral authority is challenged by the amazing work that our police forces, our law enforcement do all across America, I frankly just find the question itself incomprehensible and insulting. It’s hardly the first time Pompeo has been reminded of US inconsistency regarding its sanctimonious pronouncements about other countries’ crackdowns on “peaceful protesters” – or the press, for that matter. A staunch defender of the right of some Hong Kong residents to express their discontent with Chinese rule by destroying their city, Pompeo was confronted with the disconnect between Washington’s indulgence of those “protesters” and its brutality toward some blacklivesmatter protesters back in June. Then, too, he brushed off the notion of a “moral equivalency between what takes place in these countries where they repress their people” and the US. Despite Pompeo’s praise of their “amazing” work, US cops have killed more people in the few months following George Floyd’s death at police hands than Chinese cops have in the entirety of the Hong Kong protests. And while the US diplomat spent the past few months praising America’s press freedoms, the Trump administration was kicking dozens of Chinese journalists out of the US and severely curtailing the operations of Chinese media organizations. Even the secretary of state’s invocation of religious freedom as that which sets the US apart rings a bit hollow given that American places of worship have been prohibited for months from holding services due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while Wal-Marts and military contractors have been able to operate uninterrupted. Pompeo launched what US media called his “anti-China, anti-Russia tour” in the Czech Republic earlier this week. He promised to deliver “freedom” to Belarus, where a landslide election in favor of incumbent President Aleksandr Lukashenko has brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets declaring the vote to have been rigged.

"13 Aug, 2020",Black protector of Confederate statues dubbed a Dave Chappelle ‘skit come to life’ by Twitter users,"A black Alabama man vowing to defend symbols of the pro-slavery Confederate States of America went viral as his atypical persona reminded Internet community of a character from a sketch on comedian Dave Chappelle’s show. “Regardless of how the next person feels, I’m not going to take my flag down,”Daniel Sims said on Wednesday to the local WHNT news in Alabama’s Marshal county. He aims to protect the monuments to the US Civil War Confederacy from being taken down by vandals or any local authorities that may be pressured by the ongoing blacklivesmatter protests.“If I’ve got anything to do with it, ain’t no monument going to come down,”he proclaimed. 🤯 Check this out..A perspective on confederate monuments you probably haven’t heard before. Thoughts?pic.twitter.com/wZmswcWv8x Sims, a member of ‘Sons of Confederate Veterans’, explained his seemingly unusual position for an African American man:“My grandfather was white and he was the main one that fought in this war here.”The activist was adopted by a white family as a child.“My whole family is white … [I] went to all-white school, grew up in all-white neighborhood,”Sims said. He confessed that attempts at vandalism of Confederate statues“make [his] blood boil”.“That monument ain’t hurting nobody. That monument ain’t killing a soul,”Sims lamented, adding,“It ain’t even racist!” Internet users, however, mostly seemed to mock him for defending Confederate symbols, comparing him to a 2003 comedy sketch by comedian Dave Chapelle titled“Clayton Bigsby, the world’s only black white supremacist”. In the story a blind man played by Chaplle himself is unaware that he is black, and so he becomes a top Ku Klux Klan ideologue. Twitter users called Sims“Clayton Bigsby come to life.” Clayton Bigsby come to life Dave Chapelle s Clayton Bixby 😂😂 They also said that Chapelle turned out to have been“ahead of his time”andjokedabout the comedian being a“prophet.” I think people miss the point when they see that news clip going around of the ""real-life Clayton Bigsby"" and say Dave Chappelle was ahead of his time. The reality is America in 2020 is simply running way behind schedule. Even though Sims’ persona was deemed unusual, his position seems to be motivated by common events. The rise of the anti-racist blacklivesmatter protest movement following the death of George Floyd at the end of May mounted pressure on many local authorities to removed statues considered“racist.” The movements’ surge coincided with increased instances of vandalism as self-proclaimed activists aimed to take down the undesirable statues themselves, with varying degrees of success.

"13 Aug, 2020","Americans are free to vote Trump out of office, but they may be stuck with Soros forever – whether or not they like him","George Soros had some tough words for Donald Trump, calling him “dangerous” and willing to do “anything to stay in power.” But what about the financier himself, who operates across the globe outside of democratic due process? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge The life of the billionaire financier seems to be one long battle against the purported enemies of the ‘open society’ – a controversial concept popularized by Karl Popper, a Vienna-born philosopher who wrote ‘The Open Society and Its Enemies’. Chief among his sworn adversaries is Trump, whose ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign calls for, among other things, a wall constructed on the US-Mexico border and less reliance on foreign factory workers. On the occasion of his 90th birthday this week, Soros sat down for aninterviewwith the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, in which he expressed some strident views about the US president. “I’m confident that Trump will turn out to be a transitory phenomenon, hopefully ending in November,” Soros remarked. “But he remains very dangerous. He’s fighting for his life and he’ll do anything to stay in power, because he’s violated the Constitution in many different ways and if he loses the presidency, he will be held accountable.” For anyone who has followed the trajectory of Soros’s lengthy career, those remarks will probably come across as self-serving and hypocritical. After all, the man who famously broke the Bank of England back in his relative youth does not feel constrained by any sort of democratic procedure, nor is he controlled by a system of checks and balances, as are elected officials. Instead, Soros, by virtue of his magnificent wealth alone, it seems, is able to create the world of his dreams – and not a single person has ever cast a vote on whether they support his grand plans or not. Take the latest protests to hit the United States, for example, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer. At an extremely sensitive juncture in American history, when racial tensions were at breaking point, Soros decided this was the perfect time todonatealmost a quarter of a billion dollars to several racial justice groups, including blacklivesmatter (BLM), which is responsible for violent protests in cities across the nation. Soros said he was moved to act because this was the first time in the US “that a large majority of the population, other than black people, recognizes that there is systemic discrimination against blacks that can be traced back to slavery.” Soros is wrong, however – or at least needs to be challenged on his perceptions. Many Americans, including blacks, reject the notion that the country is gripped by “systemic discrimination” and racism. While there are certainly no shortage of bigots in the US, as there are everywhere, blacks and whites have been working together for many decades to achieve racial equality. And let’s face it: no American alive today has been a slave owner, just as no black person today has ever been a slave. So, why is Soros dragging up the institution of slavery, which came to an end almost 200 years ago, following the deadliest war in America’s history? But donating money to controversial activist groups is child’s play compared toreshapingthe American justice system. Yes, Soros has been quietly dabbling in that project as well. In 2016, it was reported that he’d donated over $3 million to progressive black and Hispanic candidates for district attorney campaigns. Onebeneficiaryof that largesse is Kim Gardner, who is now the circuit attorney for St. Louis, Missouri. To understand what sort of ‘progressive’ Soros prefers, Gardner pressed charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a married couple who responded to BLM protesters trespassing onto their property and making threatening gestures by brandishing firearms. The couplesaidthey exerted their Second Amendment right to “bear arms” out of fear for their lives. Yet, according to Soros-backed Gardner, they were out of bounds. This all seems to be part of a very weird trend happening in Democrat-controlled cities and states, many of which have received Soros money: at the same time that violent protesters are allowed to ransack urban centers, calls are going out to “defund the police,” while average citizens are losing the right to protect themselves from harm. And Soros’s influence is not limited to the US. Not by a long shot. In 2018, he was audacious enough and, more importantly, rich enough, to promote his plans for “saving” the European Union from an “existential crisis.” This centered on three controversialideas: providing monetary assistance to countries in Africa and other developing nations, including through migration to the EU; addressing the question of austerity, which is ironic, considering that Europeans are being asked to do more for foreigners while expecting to receive less assistance from their governments; and finally, Brexit, which Soros says is a bad idea for the United Kingdom. George Soros has spent billions in the EU to undermine the nation state. This is where the real international political collusion is.pic.twitter.com/ANXOII7SFY Now, whether or not one agrees or disagrees with Soros on these issues, and many others, is not the point (for a more sympathetic view of Mr Soros, readthis). The point is that one immensely wealthy man, who holds no public office, and is not accountable to voters, has managed to exert unfathomable influence over the political landscape of many nations. For anyone who doubts that assertion, consider the 177-pagepamphletpublished by Open Society, entitled ‘Reliable Allies in the European Parliament (2014–2019).’ In it, 226 EU MEPs are listed and labeled according to their political orientation and views. According to the publication, “The presence of an MEP in this mapping indicates that they are likely to support Open Society’s work. Considering there are 751 members of the European Parliament, ‘reliable allies’ of George Soros hold at least one-third of seats.” That revelation becomes even more problematic when it’s remembered that Soros donated $18 billion to Open Society Foundations in 2017, making it one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the world. While some may argue that Soros has done many great things with his money, there are many people who disagree. Yet they have no zero say in the matter, simply because they don t possess a war chest from which to promote their views, however haphazard they may be. In the case of Donald Trump, for example, the American people will be able to vote in November, if they want him to remain in the White House for another four years. Yet, although Soros’s contribution to the world of politics is arguably no less than Trump’s, and possibly more, nobody is permitted to vote on his controversial agendas. If Soros were genuinely concerned about the people, as he proclaims, he would allow more democracy to shine in his gold-plated world. The fact that he does not says everything we need to know.

"13 Aug, 2020",Unconvinced by virtue signaling: Poll shows 8 in 10 Americans think corporate anti-racism statements in BLM era are disingenuous,"Efforts by corporations to kowtow to the woke crowd may avail little because few Americans see sincerity in the anti-racism messages pouring out of PR departments amid blacklivesmatter protests, a poll has revealed. Only 19 percent of Americansbelievegenuine concern over the treatment of black people in the US was a major contributing factor behind companies speaking out about race, according to a Pew Research Center poll released on Wednesday. Just 14 percent of Republicans and 22 percent of Democrats considered the motivations to be genuine. There were significant variations by the race of respondents – for instance, 30 percent of blacks thought companies were acting on genuine concern, versus 14 percent of whites – but all groups largely found the statements to be motivated by outside pressure. Some 69 percent of those polled cited outside pressure as the key motivating factor, including 75 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of Democrats. Pressure on Corporate America to support BLM mushroomed as protesters took to the streets following the May 25 death of Minneapolis black man George Floyd in police custody. Companies such as CVS, Chick-fill-A, and Goya were put on an""anti-black list""for exhibiting""anti-black behavior.""In the case of drugstore chain CVS, that behavior was donating money to political organizations that support President Donald Trump. Companies such as Airbnb, Grubhub, Microsoft and Cisco were praised for being supportive of the BLM cause. Much of that support took the form of cash donations to BLM and related groups. Othersmademulti-faceted pledges. Microsoft, for instance, committed more than $1 billion altogether, including internal diversity and inclusion programs, grants to black-owned business partners, and donations to groups that serve black communities. The company also pledged to double its number of black employees in senior positions by 2025. While more than eight in 10 Americans doubt the sincerity of anti-racism statements, 52 percent said it s important that companies make public comments about political or social issues, the Pew poll showed. A total of 75 percent of black respondents said such statements are important, but just 42 percent of whites agreed. There also was a political divide on the question, as 71 percent of Democrats said making statements on political or social issues is important, versus 31 percent of Republicans.

"12 Aug, 2020",Cure worse than disease: Ruptly filmed REAL BLM protesters burning a Bible. NY Times tried to ‘debunk’ it with actual FAKE NEWS,"Mainstream media have denounced RT’s Ruptly video agency for documenting Portland protesters burning Bibles, dismissing the unaltered footage as ‘Russian disinfo’ in an attempt at bad-faith ‘shoot the messenger’ gaslighting. Protesters gather around a burning Bible, chanting“F*** Trump,”as they neatly drape an American flag over the flames. A few of the demonstrators rub their hands over the tiny fire, aping warming themselves as the flames devour the book. The 90-second clip was part of a 4-hour livestream. It’s an incendiary image (no pun intended) – protesters already denounced from some corners as anti-American taking aim at beloved national and religious symbols – but Ruptly didn’t attempt to interpret the video beyond explaining the events took place on the 65th day of protests, after federal agents had left the courthouse. The images speak for themselves. But according to the New York Times, the video’s rapid spread through social media and the conservative infosphere was not the organic result of its newsworthy content that appeared to support their political beliefs – it was instead a deliberate Kremlin propaganda campaign,“one of the first viral Russian disinformation hits of the 2020 presidential campaign.” How Russia amplified a misleading story about the Portland protests and how it spread in American media.@AllMattNYTand I take a dive into the world of disinfo.https://t.co/EU5nxEVCM0 The Times doesn’t explicitly accuse the Ruptly photographer of faking the video, but the outlet does everything else it can to cast the clip’s authenticity into doubt –“the truth,”the paper insists,“was far more mundane”than the outpouring of dramatic headlines would have one believe. Not only was the fire“far from the main action of the protest,”the Times wrote, claiming this was obvious from how the footage“looks and sounds,”but the act itself was hardly the shocking display it’s been presented as:“A few protesters among the many thousands appear to have burned a single Bible – and possibly a second – for kindling to start a bigger fire.” Anything beyond that, they suggested, was Russian disinfo, and the conservative commentators who“took the bait”and ran with the story are useful idiots misled by those notorious sowers of division. Case closed? This simplistic morality play raises more questions than it answers, starting with“how many Bibles is it considered acceptable to burn during a ‘peaceful’ protest?” Ruptly s footage was unaltered, and its original title –“Portland demonstrators set Bible and US flag alight on 65th night of protests”– is merely a straightforward description of the video’s contents. The video description is no more speculative than the title, and a media agency (no matter where it’s based) can hardly be blamed for what viewers read into its footage. Far from“disinfo,”Ruptly has accrued a total of 1,900 minutes of live footage from Portland between the end of July and the start of August, showing all aspects of the demonstrations. One viral clip taken from the live coverageshowsfederal agents tackling a woman and pinning her to the ground. The video racked up 5.2 million views. It was conservative social media provocateur Ian Miles Cheong who claimed“left wing activists”had brought“a stack of Bibles”for a religious-themed bonfire in front of the Portland courthouse – a claim that was then picked up by everyone from Republican Senator Ted Cruz to Donald Trump Jr. But that doesn’t matter to the Times: all subsequent coverage was fruit of a poisonous (Russian) tree. Left-wing activists bring a stack of Bibles to burn in front of the federal courthouse in Portland.https://t.co/lYWY0x8n8P Except Ruptly wasn’t the only agency to film the incident. The New York Postgot its own shotof the burning bible and flag, and local CBS affiliate KOINwroteabout the burning Bible on a live newsfeed of the protest before Ruptly had even posted the clip. It’s no longer rare to see mainstream media running interference for antifa protesters when they commit disturbing acts. Buzzfeed wrote alengthy defenseof a BLM“raid”on Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, explaining the pastor’s“bigoted”views in detail and implying they justified the horde of shouting demonstrators laying waste to the house of worship. Oh, and RT retweeted the footage, so that story is disinformation, too. Self-styled propaganda experts and academics have been low-key lobbying – through misuse of the term inacademic papersand morally-bankrupt“experiments”– to redefine“disinformation”itself as“facts arranged to serve a purpose”by governments the US doesn’t like, and mainstream media have eagerly latched on to this new definition. As a result – and with the US election just months away – the message matters less every day. It’s the messenger that determines whether something can be trusted.

"11 Aug, 2020"," If they don t stand for the national anthem, I hope they don t open : Donald Trump issues fresh NFL anti-kneeling barb","Donald Trump has again outlined his view that no sportspeople should kneel during the national anthem, saying that he would rather the NFL didn t begin its season than see blacklivesmatter protests before games. Speaking to a Fox Sportsmorning radio showon Tuesday, the US president spoke on a range of topics, including Tom Brady s recent move from the New England Patriots to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but soon hit one of his more favored sports talking points: the wave of athletes across multiple disciplines kneeling before games, or during the national anthem, to protest police brutality and promote equality. Trump s stance has long been a consistent one, and dates back to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick popularizing the blacklivesmatter movement before a game in 2016 - and this time around he says that he would rather not see football at all than have to sit through players exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest. ""If they don’t stand for the national anthem, I hope they don’t open,""Trump said, adding that the owners of the league s various teams are well aware of his stance. ""They know my feelings very well, they’ve been expressed."" Trump, meanwhile, lauded the NHL s pregame demonstrations in which players opt not to kneel and with no blacklivesmatter imagery being displayed on uniforms or otherwise - while being critical of both the MLB and the""very nasty""NBA s whose pregame demonstrations included both. He also criticized the television ratings that the basketball league was getting, saying without evidence that people were""very angry""at the situation. The NFL has yet to outline any specific plans for pre-game demonstrations ahead of the league s expected start in September, but there are highly likely to take place given that Kaepernick first popularized the expression on the side of an NFL field. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who was once a vocal opponent of the kneeling protests, admitted in a statement following the death of George Floyd that the league took an incorrect stance under his leadership. ""We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" Goodell said in a statement in June. ""We, the National Football League, believe blacklivesmatter ."" However, Trump clearly isn t on the same page. ""You have to stand for your flag, and you have to respect your flag and your country,"" Trumpsaid. ""You’re making millions of dollars a year playing a sport you’d be playing anyway, they’d be playing it on the weekends. ""And they have to respect their country. If they don’t, frankly, if the NFL didn’t open I’d be very happy."" ",https://www.rt.com/sport/497721-donald-trump-nfl-anthem-kneel/
"11 Aug, 2020",Seattle’s 1st black female chief RESIGNS after city council chops police budget & officers’ salaries,"Seattle police chief Carmen Best has announced her resignation following a city vote to slash law enforcement budgets, including her own salary. Best, who was on the force for 28 years, described the cuts as “punitive.” Seattle’s city council approved legislation to enact significant cuts in a 7-1 vote on Monday, which will eliminate some $4 million from the police department’s $400 million yearly budget, including a sizable reduction of $800,000 to the PD’s recruitment spending. Among other measures, the 2020 budget package will also cap Best’s salary at $275,000, reduced from $294,000. Chief Best has been vocal in her opposition to those cuts, and told me in an interview today that she felt targeted by a ""punitive"" proposal to cut her pay by 40%: ""I do feel like it s ... animus toward me specifically."" Hours after the vote, local media were inundated with reports that Best, the city’s first black and female police chief, was stepping down. She confirmed the news in a letter to the Seattle Police Department on Monday evening, saying that her resignation would be effective from September 2. #BREAKING: This is the full e-mail Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best sent to the entire Seattle Police Department at 9:32 tonight, stating she’ll be retiring from SPD, effective September 2nd, 2020. She writes, “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served as your chief.”pic.twitter.com/bEM0VOllw8 Best did not reveal in the letter what prompted her to end her career with the SPD. However,  local media linked the move to the budget cuts, citing sources close to the chief. While the cuts will also see up to 100 officers laid off from the force by November and a $150,000 pay cap for command staff, they fall far short of the 50 percent cut sought by some activists, who have been vocal in demanding to see the SDP defunded following the police killing of George Floyd in late May. Among those calling for a more radical proposal is councilmember Kshama Sawant – the lone dissenter in Monday’s vote – who insisted the cuts did not go far enough, arguing“this budget fails working people.” Best’s attorney, Anne Bremner, previously argued that the police chief was being targeted with retaliation over past criticisms of the city council, alleging that lawmakers had moved against her in secret. “[Best] and Jenny Durkan gave a press conference where they were critical of the council. In my view, this was retaliation because as soon as they did that, the council – in a vote that was not publicized, that was not on the agenda publicly – voted to reduce her salary,”Bremner told a local news outlet. Critics have already weighed in on the reports, with one local journalist calling the move“surreal,”while suggesting the city council had“[chased] off a police chief, a Seattle veteran, and a woman of color.”Others noted the irony that the fight against ‘white supremacy’ had forced a black woman out of her job. It seems surreal the@SeattleCouncil, which met via ZOOM, on a remote basis......could chase off a Police Chief, a Seattle veteran, & a woman of color, who was *in* the streets on near daily basis.Debate funding.

"11 Aug, 2020",Divisive martyrs: Chicago s latest excuse for mass looting marks another dubious case to undermine protest movement s credibility,"We don t even know his name yet, but a 20-year-old man who had already wracked up four arrests on his record was shot and wounded by Chicago police after shooting at them and running. In so doing, he inspired a movement. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has written or edited for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. That movement took the form of a""very orchestrated""caravan of cars overnight Sunday-Monday that rushed aggrieved parties about 10 miles from Chicago s Englewood neighborhood, where the shootout with police took place, to the Magnificent Mile downtown shopping district. Once there, folks expressed their outrage over systemic racism by helping themselves to whatever they could carry off from some of Chicago s poshest stores – from Nordstrom to Gucci to Louis Vuitton to a Tesla dealership. Police chase a couple guys out of the Macy’s and dozens more come in.#ChicagoScanner#Chicagopic.twitter.com/61wKHUMWmL It didn t matter that police were called Sunday afternoon to investigate reports of a man carrying a gun and confronted a person who matched the suspect s description. It didn t matter that the man responded by shooting at police and fleeing on foot. It didn t matter that Chicago is suffering an epidemic of gun violence in which young black people are killing dozens of other black people just about every month. There were scores to settle against a system that is allegedly hunting down black people and killing them, and if Italian and French designers had to pay the price for righteous retribution, then so be it. There were casualties, of course. A security guard and at least one bystander were shot. Thirteen police were injured. Countless businesses had another nail driven into their coffins after enduring a Covid-19 lockdown and a previous round of violent protests and looting after Minneapolis black man George Floyd died in police custody on May 25. It was all part of the price to be paid for this latest round of racial outcry. Except, as Mayor Lori Lightfoot pointed out, this had nothing to do with""First Amendment protected activity.""Nor was it spontaneous or reflective of social injustice.""This was obviously very orchestrated,""said the Rev. Michael Pflger, a Catholic priest on Chicago s south side. Before Operation Shopping Spree began, dozens of protesters confronted police in Englewood after a false rumor was spread (perhaps on purpose) that officers had shot a 15-year-old boy. Police blamed an""agitator""for""getting people worked up without having the full story."" That this wasn t a legitimate form of protest is inarguable, though I suspect someone at CNN or MSNBC may be trying to write a looter-apologist script right now. Moreover, the incident that was chosen to trigger the crowd s reaction was tragically wrong, and it s not the first time such a dubious martyr became the call to action. Sunday was the six-year anniversary of one of the most consequential police shootings in US history, the killing of Michael Brown. The 18-year-old Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, policeman, setting off riots that torched local businesses and led to protests in other US cities.""Hands up, don t shoot""became the rallying cry of protesters, signifying how Brown was murdered while holding his hands up and submitting to police. The problem was, that slogan was based on a false witness. Evidence showed that Brown, who stood 6-foot-4 and weighed nearly 300 pounds, was assaulting officer Darren Wilson and trying to take the policeman s gun when he was shot. Just as in Sunday s incident in Chicago, the alleged victim wasn t a victim of police brutality. Nevertheless, the Ferguson case remains with us. Lest we forget, Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden reminded us Sunday on Twitter, noting the anniversary of when Brown s life""was taken in Ferguson, reigniting a movement""and saying,""We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing."" It s been six years since Michael Brown s life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing. At a time when riots are still ongoing in some US cities, Biden s message was kerosene. The astonishing thing was, Biden saw fit to tweet so dishonestly even though the Ferguson debacle happened when he was vice president. He and President Barack Obama s administration was in charge when the US Department of Justice investigated the Brown incident and found that the shooting was justified. Initial reports from Chicago suggest that Sunday s police shooting was at least equally justified. And yet, it triggered mayhem. Why do such cases get so much attention and cause so much harm when there are far more legitimate examples of wrongful killings by police? About 1,000 people arekilledeach year in shootings by US police, and although most are justified, there are tragic cases with innocent victims. Emphasizing the shaky (or worse) cases undermines the credibility of the protest movement, including blacklivesmatter . It also keeps people from being able to unify on the real issue of police brutality. Pretending that the only motivation for that brutality is skin color further weakens the message. More white people are killed by police than blacks and Hispanics combined,accordingto U.S. Bureau of Justice figures. The Floyd case was far more compelling. Although leaked bodycam footage showed the story to be more complicated than previously told, almost everyone who saw video of officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd s neck for nine minutes was disgusted and outraged. Sunday s Chicago case has no such victim, yet the reaction showed the dangers and dire real-life consequences that can result when new martyrs are created in this era of social media. Let s hope that when his name is released, it will be quickly forgotten. This is not a name we want etched into the nation s already painful history of injustice.

"7 Aug, 2020",The New York Times has finally woken up to the fact that Seattle’s CHOP was a complete disaster – a month after it was disbanded,"Following an investigative report the paper of record has revealed that business owners who were stuck in the Capitol Hill Organised Protest ‘aren’t so sure about abolishing the police’. No sh*t Sherlock. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall The New York Times has done something distinctly out of character and actually produced some decent journalism. Taking a break from getting editors sacked for allowing Republican senators to write op-eds and forcing out the few remaining sane people on their staff for not quaffing the identity politics Cool-Aid enthusiastically enough, they dispatched a reporter toSeattle to pick through the remnants of the CHOP, a month after it closed. The Capital Hill Organised Protest, formally CHAZ (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone), was the area of the city that, for 23 glorious days, declared independence from the United States. A bunch of blacklivesmatter and Antifa radicals hoofed out the police and decided to try and run the area as some sort of Marxist utopia. What they actually established was a gang run hellhole that made the Wild West look like Switzerland. It wasn’t described as such at the time of course. Seattle’s mayor said the city was in for a“summer of love”and most of the left-wing press would have had you believe that it was pretty much a hippy commune full of free vegan food and urban collective farms. The land of soy milk and honey was disbanded on July 1 and was duly eulogised by the usual suspects as basically an extended block party. A month on, the NY Times finally got around to sending a reporter to speak to the people who lived and worked in the area before the protestors moved in and produced an admittedly excellent piece of reportage on the situation. It was headlined,”Abolish the Police? Those Who Survived the Chaos in SeattleAren’t So Sure.”The piece, as journalist Michael Tracey observed on Twitter, would have been dismissed as right-wing propaganda just a month ago and shows that this little experiment in anarcho-communism was a million miles away from paradise. A month and a half ago, an article like this would ve been widely dismissed and denounced as right-wing propaganda To say they“aren’t sure”has to be the understatement of the year. The picture painted by the residents is one of gangs of armed thugs running protection rackets and widespread vandalism. The first person mentioned in the piece, a gay man of Middle Eastern extraction named Faizel Khan, reveals that to get to the coffee shop he runs he had to get permission from“gun wielding white men”who at one point barricaded him and all his customers in the store. Mr Khan’s experiences during these three and a bit weeks of lawlessness were so horrendous that he and a host of other small business owners, described as“lonely voices in progressive areas,”are suing Seattle after the local police force refused to respond to their calls for the duration of the CHOP. And as the litany of horrors they were subjected to is laid bare in the NY Times article, it is not hard to see why. Another character we meet in this saga is Rick Hearns. In his pre-CHOP days, Mr Hearns was a security guard for many years, but after the police vacated the area (their precinct was taken over by protesters and then promptly set on fire) he became part of the “ blacklivesmatter Community Patrol”. This patrol had locals“pay for their protection.”Now what other organisation does that remind you of? If you can’t think of it, may I suggest you watch virtually any Martin Scorsese movie and I think you’ll get the picture. It doesn’t sound like they were particularly good at ensuring community cohesion either, consideringsix people were shotunder their jurisdiction and two of them died. Interestingly, since they were replacing the“institutionally racist”police force, (run by a black woman incidentally but why let facts spoil it) one of the victims was a black teenager. Observers also noted that rather than being a multi-racial melting pot of equality, the CHOP turned into a“white occupation”as the numbers of Antifa activists began to outnumber the BLM protesters. They also established“black only segregated areas”within the CHOP, making it frightening similar to the Confederacy, which also, coincidentally, seceded from the union. Oh, and they had a Warlord, Raz from CHAZ, too, just as an icing on the cake. Quite why these so-called activists felt the need to see how anarchy turns out in a world where Somaila exists is beyond me, and frankly any sane person who is even vaguely aware of history. I’m sure if they’d managed to get hold of the port it wouldn’t have been long before they decided to give piracy on the high seas a try, but alas they didn’t have the time. This just makes the tone of the NY Times piece all the more baffling. While it does chart the horrors of the zone well, framing the notion of“abolishing the police”as anything other than irredeemably stupid is frankly ridiculous. I suppose they do deserve praise for finally telling the story, but in no way does it make up for the way they have fomented and given succour to the absurd and dangerous ideas that gave rise to the CHOP for so long.

"7 Aug, 2020",Oprah teams up with Women’s March founders to whitewash their reputations by piggybacking on Breonna Taylor killing,"Billionaire media mogul Oprah Winfrey has bankrolled 26 billboards in Louisville calling for the police officers who shot Breonna Taylor to be charged. Like too many “saying her name,” though, Winfrey’s campaign reeks of grift. Helen Buyniskiis an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23 Winfrey began deploying the billboards on Thursday – one for each of the 26 years of Taylor’s life – and they are expected to be in place by Monday. The displays read “Demand that the police involved in killing Breonna Taylor be arrested and charged” and feature a link toUntilFreedom.com, a “racial justice organization” founded by Women’s March co-founders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, hip-hop artist Mysonne Linen, and civil rights lawyer Angelo Pinto. The TV billionaire has jumped onto the Breonna Taylor bandwagon with both feet, also featuring the slain black woman on the front cover of her O Magazine for September – the first time in over two decades the publication has featured anyone other than Winfrey herself on its cover. The cover photo is the same image as the one appearing on the Louisville billboards, which also feature a giant “O” Oprah Magazine logo, facilitating maximum brand recognition. Taylor was infamously shot by Louisville police as she lay in bed in the early hours of March 13 as officers served a ‘no-knock’ warrant, supposedly looking for drugs – even though the dealer they suspected of using the apartment as a stash house was already locked up. The cops’ failure to identify themselves as they broke into the apartment led Taylor’s boyfriend to shoot at what he thought were burglars. The officers fired back, hitting Taylor eight times and killing her. While the Louisville City Council unanimouslyvoted to banthe controversial no-knock warrants that led to her death in June, the police responsible were only recently fired and still haven’t been charged with her murder. Taylor’s tragic death – as well as the failure to punish those responsible – has become a cause célèbre among the blacklivesmatter movement and the parade of grifters operating in its midst. Despite her billions, Winfrey hasn’t hesitated to recast herself as a victim of discrimination amid the racial reckoning which has roiled the US over the past three months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She launched a new series on Apple TV+ in July called ‘The Oprah Conversation’, devoted to castigating her white audience for their supposed racism and encouraging her black audience to blame white people for their problems. Guests like former NFL player Emmanuel Acho and bestselling “antiracist” author Ibram X. Kendi have joined her on the show to push her divisive message. In last week’s episode with Acho, Winfrey declared “the system of white people” was responsible for keeping black people off “the ladder of success.” No matter how poor a white person might be, the TV personality stated, “you still have your whiteness.” Unsurprisingly, a woman whose net worth is north of $2.6 billion lecturing white people about their privilege didn’t go over very well – Winfrey was excoriated for her tone-deafness on social media, and even by some in the mainstream media. The Taylor billboard campaign would be an easy distraction from her pushing her victim act a little too hard down her adoring public’s throat – after all, who can fault a billionaire using their money to demand justice for a young woman murdered in her bed by police? Winfrey is far from the only celebrity virtue-signaling over Taylor’s body – well-heeled opportunists from actress-turned-royal Meghan Markle to the entire NBA have deployed her name as a virtue-signaling talisman. Until Freedom, too, is going all in on Taylor. The New York-based group announced earlier this week they would move their entire team to Louisville to organize “day in day out” until those responsible for her death were held accountable. Co-founders Sarsour and Mallory were booted off the Women’s March board last year, supposedly for “antisemitism,” over their refusal to distance themselves from controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.

He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge In the wee hours of May 29, as blacklivesmatter riots were engulfing sections of New York City, Brooklyn lawyers Urooj Rahman and Colinford Mattis made one of the worst career moves of their young lives. But you’d never guess that from the glowing media coverage that followed. With Mattis behind the wheel of their vehicle, Rahman lit the fuse on a Molotov cocktail, improvised from an empty beer bottle, and tossed it into a police cruiser that had already suffered mob damage. The police gave chase and the two were duly arrested; they now face up to 45 years in prison. Judging by the resurging wave of apologism, including the recentarticlein New York Intelligencer, however, the Bonnie and Clyde impersonators appear to be heading instead to the Academy Awards, complete with the politically tainted acceptance speeches. Just several paragraphs deep into the puff piece, author Lisa Miller drops Donald Trump’s name as though this will absolve the attorneys from their disastrous night on the town. A terribly sad story. Two young and idealistic lawyers, get wrapped up in the BLM protest movement. In a moment of madness they throw a Molotov cocktail into an abandoned police car and burn it. Now they face a minimum 35 years in a federal prison.https://t.co/o8aRqjOSwY Amid this intensely divisive period in US political history,“when a president and his advisers seem to regard the law as an obstacle course; when an attorney general metes out favors, not justice; and when immigrant children are held in cages and men are killed on video by police, some lawyers may want to embrace a more flexible definition of ‘lawless,’”Miller writes, not only suggesting that the transgressions of the Trump administration should exonerate attorneys who moonlight as arsonists, but that the law should actually go easy on such criminal behavior. In the very next line, Miller introduces the reader to unnamed friends of the attorneys who would probably“concede in private”that tossing a Molotov cocktail into a police cruiser“represents a lapse in judgment,” but none of their peers “are willing to discuss the degree to which their friends may have been ethically, professionally, morally, or legally out of bounds.” Really? If that line doesn’t make you shout at your monitor, Miller, still improvising for the pair’s anonymous friends, goes on to argue that“the [right-wing] prosecution of their friends for an act of… political vandalism is far more extreme than the crime itself; that it amounts to a criminalization of dissent and reflects a broader right-wing crusade against people of color and the progressive left.” In other words, to follow this twisted line of logic, arresting someone for breaking the law is“extreme,”while torching a police car is practically the same as exercising one’s First Amendment right to free speech. Got it. Who hasn’t made a Molotov cocktail and thrown it at a police car in a momentary lapse of judgement at one point in their career? 🤦‍♂️ Miller wraps up her eloquent apology by suggesting that the two attorneys are not really troublemakers looking to“f--king take it all down,”as Rahman was quoted as saying shortly before lobbing her explosive beer bottle, but rather“civil-rights heroes, even martyrs, instead of professionals who crossed a line.” You can’t make this stuff up, but obviously someone did. The rest of the rambling article champions on behalf of the offenders in exactly the same vein. At one point, another phantom friend was quoted as calling Colinford Mattis a“cute, lovable baby”when he’s not driving getaway cars from crime scenes. Another suggested Mattis could someday“run for mayor,”I’m guessing so that he could disband the entire police force – every Liberal’s wet dream – and never have to worry about facing criminal charges again. Reading this drivel hammered home the point that the United States is splitting apart along a fault line that separates two radically different political camps that simply cannot live together under the same roof. To prove the point, imagine if Rahman and Mattis had been from the wrong side of the political train tracks, that is, deplorable Trump supporters. Would the media have been so enthusiastic to support their criminal actions? We already know the answer. Rewind to January 2019. Nick Sandmann, a 15-year-old student from Covington Catholic High School, was standing with his friends on the National Mall, waiting for a bus to take them home after attending a March for Life event. Suddenly, the teenager found himself face-to-face with a Native American elder who was beating on a ceremonial drum. Sandmann, donning a red MAGA cap, responded by unflinchingly staring back at the man with a calm smile on his face. And that was the end of the story, or at least it should have been. What followed next has been rightly called a national Rorschach Test. The mainstream media found video of the exchange and proceeded to present it as some sort of racist attack against the Indian by a teenager who did not identify with the left. As a result, Nick Sandmann, who didn’t trash a police cruiser, loot a shopping mall, or assault a single person, was dragged over the media coals for – wait for it – smirking. “The smirk on the face of this white kid with a red MAGA hat, as he taunts a Native American elder singing an intertribal song, is simply unbearable,”wroteDavid Boddiger for Splinter. Former CNN host Reza Aslan was so annoyed by the teenager’s smugness that hetweeted,“Honest question. Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid’s?” Finally, BuzzFeed writer Anne Helen Petersoncommentedin a now-deleted tweet that Sandmann’s expression is“the look of white patriarchy.” How is it possible that the media could express such palpable hatred for a young man who clearly committed no crime, yet glorify the actions of two others that were undeniably illegal? The media’s blatant lack of objective reporting, to the point where criminals are portrayed as saints at the same time that innocents are demonized, is helping to lead the country into dangerous political waters. At a time when the country desperately needs a meditative and dispassionate media voice to defuse partisan tensions, it has got just the opposite. Had the media spent just five minutes researching what had actually happened between Sandmann and the Native American (summed uphere), they could have saved themselves massive amounts of embarrassment, not to mention money. In response to their inaccurate coverage of the incident, lawyers representing the teenagersought$800 million from CNN, the Washington Post, NBC Universal, and manyotheroutlets. Last month, the Washington Postsettledout of court for an undisclosed amount of money. CNN, meanwhile,settledin January. Although Nick Sandmann may have got the last laugh through his legal saga, the country should be shedding tears considering that mainstream media bias has not gone away, and, as recent events suggest, continues to drive a deep wedge in American society that can only end in disaster.

"6 Aug, 2020","Democrats drifting to extreme left because they are ‘owned by George Soros,’ claims former House speaker Gingrich","The Democrat Party continues to drift radically leftward, and its leadership will never rebuke militant elements like Antifa, because it s controlled by billionaire leftist George Soros, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich said. “All of these Democrats are now basically owned by the left,”Gingrich said on Wednesday in an interview on Fox News.“They are not going to pick any fights. They are owned by people who are financed by George Soros.” Gingrich made his comments after Democrats in a US Senate hearing on Tuesday refused to directly criticize the conduct of Antifa, whose members have been accused of hijacking ongoing protests against police brutality and fueling riots in cities such as Portland and Seattle, amid a wave of anti-racism rallies that have swept the country since late May. Short for ‘anti-fascist,’ the group is composed of a loose-knit network of activists on the radical left who frequently employ violent protest tactics, at times bringing along makeshift weapons to demonstrations and clashing with police. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, noted that vandalism and violence by the likes of Antifa have undermined peaceful demonstrations, and chided Democrats for not condemning them. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) then asked:“So, how many times have I had to say we should be denouncing violent extremists of every stripe?” “Does that include Antifa?”Cruz countered, with Hirono shooting back that she didn t have time for the Republican’s“rhetorical speeches”before walking out of the hearing. The hearing ended with Sen. Hirono walking out after confrontation with Sen. Cruz over Antifa. In roughly 50 hearings, this was a first for me. I was not sure if I should turn off the lights when I left.https://t.co/R1qrtA94LW Law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified at Tuesday s hearing, said the scene was unlike anything he had encountered in the 50 congressional hearings in which he has participated.“I was not sure if I should turn off the lights when I left,”he said. Gingrich said the fracas reflects“a war between two worlds. It s not a normal presidential election.”Soros-financed local leaders and district attorneys have helped create disastrous conditions in Democrat-controlled cities across the country, such as Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle and Chicago, he continued. Some of those cities are taking steps to defund their police departments, one of the demands made by blacklivesmatter activists in the wake of George Floyd s May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody. “The propaganda machine of the left, which used to be the news media, is going to do everything it can to hide from it, but I think the average American is beginning to realize this stuff is dangerous,”Gingrich said.“That s why by three to one they don t want to defund the police.” The Hungarian-born Democrat mega-donor became obscenely wealthy through currency speculation, before turning his eye towards influencing politics. In addition to funding various Democratic candidates in state and congressional races, Soros has invested heavily in local elections, where his money could have a much greater impact. He specifically targeted district attorneys, who in the US make all prosecutorial decisions at local level. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/497220-gingrich-democrats-soros-antifa/
"5 Aug, 2020","Do black Americans really support defunding the police? Over 80% want cops to stay & keep patrolling their communities, poll shows","Despite blacklivesmatter protests raging across the country and moves to defund police departments or cut back their budgets, a new poll suggests black citizens don’t support the efforts to remove cops from the streets. The Galluppoll, released on Wednesday, was conducted throughout July and involved over 36,000 adults across the US. A whopping 81 percent of black respondents said they want police to spend the same amount of time in their neighborhoods that they already do or to have even more of a presence. The results are similar across races, with 88 percent of white Americans, 83 percent of Hispanic Americans, and 72 percent of Asian Americans all saying the same thing. The poll also confirmed that black Americans are more likely to see a police presence in their communities, with 73 percent of respondents answering that they notice cops in their neighborhoods“sometimes”or“very often.”That’s compared to 65 percent of non-black respondents. While that gap could be seen as supporting the charge that black communities are over-policed, it had little impact on whether citizens wanted more or less police presence.“The slightly elevated frequency with which black Americans see police in their neighborhood has limited impact on their preferences for changing the local police presence,”Gallup wrote in their findings. About a third of black citizens who responded that they“often”see police in their neighborhoods said they would like there to be less of a presence, but over 50 percent in that category don’t want any change. The poll did also show that very few black Americans are confident that a run-in with a police officer would go well. Only 18 percent said they were very confident such an encounter would go well, while 43 percent said they were somewhat confident. That distrust of police actually jumps among the general public, with 48 percent saying they were very confident an encounter with an officer would go well, while 37 percent were only somewhat confident. While the results show a general apprehension towards trusting police, especially among black Americans, there is little from the poll that supports the efforts in cities across the US that are eitherslashingpolice department budgets or moving to completelyabolishthem. “The majority of all other black Americans, including those who are ‘not too confident’ about receiving considerate police treatment, want the police to spend the same amount of time, with additional percentages favoring more time,”Gallup concludes. Since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, blacklivesmatter protests have taken place in major cities across the country, with some in places like Portland, Oregon turning violent and requiring a federal response. But if Gallop’s results are to be trusted, defunding police is not the answer most citizens support, even black Americans. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"5 Aug, 2020",Picnics and celebrity weddings are the latest to be added to the ever-growing list of things that are racist. Pass the sick bucket,"According to disingenuous race hustlers the simple act of eating outdoors is evocative of lynching and Ryan Reynolds getting married at a old plantation glamorises slavery. How is anyone taking this nonsense seriously? Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Picnics are the latest activity to have the shadow of racism cast across them by the perpetually offended, who must devote inordinate amounts of their waking hours searching for new “outrages” to be outraged about. The theory behind why the simple act of eating outdoors may be an act of white supremacy apparently stems from the fact that terrible people in old Dixie sometimes had picnics at lynchings. According to Treva Lindsey, an associate professor of women’s studies at Ohio State University, “The word, picnic, carries with it the memory that there was a time when white folks gathered to eat outside, burning black flesh would be on the menu.” This is palpably insane. Is professor Lindseyseriously suggestingthat saying “picnic” immediately transports black people back to the antebellum South like something out of a Jordan Peele horror movie? Is she arguing that people of colour are reminded of their ancestors being brutally murdered if they see a white family enjoying an al fresco sandwich? Does the song “Teddy Bears Picnic” need to be consigned to the dustbin of history along with “Deutschland Uber Alles”? Apparently, the facts that the termderives from the French phrasepique-nique,and first appeared in English in aletter fromLord Chesterfieldin 1748,and has absolutely nothing to do with race whatsoever doesn’t matter. Neither does the fact that most picnics in the history of picnicking had nothing to do with lynching. No, what matters is that some racist people did something and now that thing is itself racist. This is a ridiculous way to view the world. There is a worrying tendency these days to view certain things in the worst possible light. Like in this instance, all the picnics that had nothing to do with racial murder are now viewed through the prism of those that were. But why would we allow the worst people who did something to own that act or activity when it is, in reality, completely neutral? If it is argued that picnics, or the use of the word, are to go the way of the dodo because they occasionally happened near lynchings, what else is to end up on that list? Rope? Trees? White sheets? All these things are only offensive in a certain, very specific context, and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. If we were to expand it beyond the remit of slavery and Jim Crow then all manner of things could become problematic, virtually every German company still going that existed before 1933 would surely be on the list for starters. In a similar vein, there is now a fad for apologising for using things that were once associated with some centuries old sin. Just this week actor Ryan Reynolds felt the need to apologise for his choice of wedding venue because it was on an old plantation. When the Deadpool star tied the knot with Gossip Girl’s Blake Lively in 2012 they chose a stunning South Carolina mansion calledBoone Hall. The settlement itself has been a working plantation since 1681 and remains one to this day. The hall, in which the Reynolds’ got hitched, is a colonial revival house that was built in 1936. Obviously, architecture is a matter of taste and opinion, but I’d wager most couples would be thrilled with it as a place to wed. It appears that eight years ago Mr and Mrs Reynolds did enjoy their big day and no one had a problem with it at the time, but then 2012 was a few years before the world went woke. Apparently, Reynoldsfirst got grieffor having his wedding at Boone Hall after he tweeted praise for the movie Black Panther in 2018. Your guess is as good as mine as to why his choice of wedding venue is in any way relevant to him liking a movie about a superhero from a fictional country, but I digress. This viral bout of rage clearly fizzled out quickly and probably would have stayed that way ifFast Companyhadn’t decided they wanted to score some woke points. Reynolds has given an interview to the September issue of this magazine, in which his interviewer raises the topic of his wedding venue, or, as Fast Company calls it, his“complicated personal history”. He tells us that the actor was forced to confront this“complicated history”again after the death of George Floyd, because obviously a Hollywood wedding that took place eight years ago is inexorably linked to a death in police custody in May 2020. We are told that the Deadpool star is“still clearly pained by the hurt the wedding caused, as well as by his own lack of judgment.”Reynolds himself describes it as variously“something we’ll always be deeply and unreservedly sorry for”,“impossible to reconcile”and“a giant f***ing mistake”. From those statements anyone would think that he’d had a slavery themed wedding officiated by a klansman. But he didn’t, he had a small and very private wedding, the couple didn’t publicise it, there weren’t splashes in Vogue or Hello! Magazine and, obviously, its connection to slavery was not why they chose the venue. They chose it because they liked the look of it, as did the director of the 2004 filmThe Notebookin which Boone Hall featured. Why is this anyone else’s business? The biggest problem with all of this nonsense is that I don’t believe any of the parties involved are sincere. I do not believe there are people who see picnicking families in the park and immediately think of someone stringing up a runaway slave. I do not believe that people were genuinely offended by a Hollywood actor’s wedding venue. And I don’t believe the people apologising for offending people with these “hateful” picnics and weddings are sorry. All of this is performative, virtue signalling, woke b*llocks. It doesn’t help mend any fences or improve race relations, it just lines the pockets of race hustlers and massages the egos of celebrities who like to imagine they are far more important than they are.

"5 Aug, 2020","Protesters SUE Seattle over ‘expensive gear’ required to confront cops, demand ban on riot control weapons","A group of protesters has sued the Seattle government, arguing that “unmitigated police violence” has imposed a monetary cost on their right to demonstrate freely, forcing them to buy expensive gear to safely confront the cops. Filed by five plaintiffs who took part in ongoing protests in Seattle, the suit seeks a temporary restraining order barring the city’s police department from wielding force and crowd control munitions on demonstrators, alleging heavy-handed police tactics have made“safe protest prohibitive,”as“one needs an exceptional amount of protective gear to enjoy that freedom.” “Because the Seattle Police Department has acted above and outside the law in dispensing its unbridled force, and the city has failed to prevent [the] same, the… effect is to establish a de facto protest tax,”attorney Talitha Hazelton wrote in the complaint, filed on Monday. Individual protesters subjected to SPD’s unabated and indiscriminate violence now must purchase cost-prohibitive gear to withstand munitions – even when peacefully protesting – as a condition to exercising their right to free speech and peaceable assembly. While a blanket ban on less-lethal munitions recently imposed by the city was struck down by a court in late July, aseparate court injunctionrestricting their use remains in place. The prior suit was brought by local blacklivesmatter activists, who have since asked the judge in the case to hold the SDP in contempt of the standing order, alleging officers had continued to use crowd control weapons indiscriminately, including tear gas and pepper spray. Responding to Monday’s suit, the Seattle Attorney’s Office said it would“look into these new claims,”adding that it intended to“defend the city in this matter,”according to spokesman Dan Nolte. Chief Judge Ricardo Martinez will preside over the case. Protests in Seattle erupted in late May, on the heels of the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who lost his life during a botched arrest in Minneapolis. The demonstrations have frequently escalated into violent clashes between activists and officers, at one point seeing police abandon their East Precinct in the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several weeks as protesters established CHOP – or the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest. Though the makeshift activist-encampment-slash-anarchist-commune was disbanded after a string of fatal shootings in the zone, anti-police brutality protests continue to rage on in the city.

As a shocking video showed a building collapsing in flames under an enormous cloud in the port area of the city, NBA reporter Chris Palmer told his Twitter following of almost 114,000 that the disaster was not the fireworks explosion that had been suggested by some Lebanese media outlets. READ MORE: Hundreds injured in Beirut explosions so powerful they turned streets into wasteland (VIDEOS) Viewers had suggested that fireworks had been visible as the explosion happened, while Lebanon s National News Agency reported a fire had caused the catastrophe at an explosives depot.

And saying this falsehood to such a large follower base is dangerous. you absolute dumbass Media figures and readers familiar with Palmer s reputation for left-field tweets swiftly derided his conclusion and corrected him on the nature of mushroom clouds, which a cursory check would have revealed can be caused by a wide range of detonations. ""Saying this falsehood to such a large follower base is dangerous,""pointed out one, while another said:""This Chris Palmer guy is a complete f*cking idiot."" Others argued that a nuclear explosion would have caused far more destruction than the horrific, smoke-filled aftermath over the area, adding that it would have prevented the cameramen, many of whom shot videos on their phones, from being able to capture the footage. Obviously Chris Palmer doesn t know what he is talking about. It takes a twitter user all of two minutes to discover closer footage which proves it s not atomic.

As more mockery rained in on his initial tweet, Palmer eventually attempted to ease the pile-on by deleting his ill-advised outburst, which followed a scandal at the end of May when he produced a pair of apparently contradictory tweets about the riots taking place in the US following the death of George Floyd. Having recklessly used his platform to accompany a photo of a blazing building that had been attacked by looters with the messages""burn that sh*t down""and""burn it all down"", he then called protestors""animals""and told them to leave a community near his home.

Dan Le Batard, who has previously clashed with NBA legend Magic Johnson and wrestler Diamond Dallas Page over remarks made on his wise-cracking daytime sports show, swiftly renounced a Twitter poll suggesting that light could be made of the horror injury sustained by Isaac at the weekend. Ordained minister Isaac had become the first NBA player not to kneel in support of the blacklivesmatter campaign when he returned to action with Orlando Magic, and required a wheelchair to leave the court prematurely on Sunday after suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage to his troublesome left knee. ""Is it funny that the guy who refused to kneel immediately blew out his left knee?"", asked the show s routinely provocative Twitter account, which has almost 439,000 followers.

"4 Aug, 2020","Media lives matter? More assaults on US journalists in 2020 than in previous 3 years combined, says press freedom watchdog","The number of violent incidents directed at journalists has skyrocketed, according to the US Press Freedom Tracker, which said heavy-handed police tactics during BLM protests have made 2020 a uniquely dangerous year for reporters. There have been more than 612 press freedom incidents so far this year, according to the group’s July tally. The figure includes more than 87 arrests, 140 physical attacks, 143 injuries from rubber bullets or projectiles, and 76 cases where equipment was damaged. There have also been dozens of cases of journalists being teargassed or hit with pepper spray. Latest reported aggressions against the press as of Thursday, July 30*612+ total press freedom incidents*87+ arrests140 physical attacks (90 by law enforcement)143 rubber bullet / projectiles80 tear gassings42 pepper sprayings76 equipment / newsroom damage44 other / TBD The press freedom watchdog said that the number of assaults against journalists so far in 2020 is“unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history.”The group has documented more incidents so far this year than in the previous three years combined. The organization typically records around 100-150 press freedom violations in the US each year. Journalists have repeatedly found themselves in the crossfire of nationwide blacklivesmatter protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police. According to the US Press Freedom Tracker, the cases of aggression against reporters are spread out across 72 cities and 35 states. Portland, Oregon currently has the highest reported numbers of assaults against the press, as well as the highest number of journalists hit with projectiles. Federal agents deployed to protect the city’s federal courthouse have been accused of using excessive force against protesters and media who have been covering the demonstrations. A judge recently placed a temporary restraining order on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) forces to prevent them from using crowd control measures against members of the press. The federal agents have since been put on ‘standby,’ with state and local law enforcement tasked with ensuring public safety during the protests, which have lasted for more than two months. Although the huge increase in assaults is concerning, some journalists have complained that protesters have been identifying themselves as press, even as they hurl projectiles at police. These alleged tactics have put actual journalists in danger, according to one reporter who has been on the ground in Portland. Blaze TV’s Elijah Schaffer claimed in a recent tweet that activists were using press immunity to“harass & in some cases assault officers.” This fake Antifa press problem is a pandemic This man defies orders, insults officers, and makes sexual references to them And claims he’s press with a $40 handicam mounted on a gas station tripodDue to a court order police can’t do anythingThis puts real press in dangerpic.twitter.com/cVvenAof0S “This is a new tactic ahead of the election to create mayhem.

"4 Aug, 2020",‘Erotic mind control community has a racism problem’: BLM activists go after hypnotists in latest bizarre witch hunt,"As street battles between murky federal agents, Antifa and various mom’n’pop protest groups over systemic racism continue in Portland, it appears a similar, but more insidious war is underway… in the erotic mind control community. A seemingly never-ending thread, posted to Twitter by a self-professed 30-something white woman, who is part of the ultra-niche sexualcommunitythat some were convinced was made-up, details the sordid sins among hyperactive, horny hypnotists. ""So, I want to address something that will probably surprise no one: The erotic mind control community has a problem with racism,”we are mournfullytoldby ‘I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-Karen’ Carin McLeoud, as she begins her far-reaching filibuster. So long was the list of racist abuses among the erudite eroticists, that even a video posted by journalist Ian Miles Cheong showing him just scrolling through it was too lengthy for some people’s attention spans, showing that certain white allies in the BLM movement, such as Carin, have far too much time, and not enough actual evidence of racism, on their hands. “The erotic mind control community has a problem with racism.”pic.twitter.com/GlHMUbA1XS Among the list of complaints made by the activist was the claim that black and indigenous people were portrayed as“exotic treasures”or“offensive, hurtful racist stereotypes”and that Asians were“hypersexual”. “This is not something any of us should be proud of, but, thankfully for me, I had a black member of the community to wake my sorry ass up to the seriousness of this,”she added. The Twitter treatise inspired a wave of reactions, with some suggesting that the titillating telepaths use their powers for good and not evil.""Maybe they could do the mind control to stop the racism?""one person quipped. Others suggested that perhaps Carin and her cohort of conscientious Karens had themselves been brainwashed. Apparently, marxist brainwash is stronger than erotic mind control. pic.twitter.com/0kFJYw3PMh In the meantime, Portland has recorded a record spike in homicides in recent weeks as the protests against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd’s death continue.

"3 Aug, 2020",Leaked bodycam footage shows entirety of George Floyd arrest – supporting cops’ AND protesters’ narratives (DISTURBING VIDEO),"Police body-camera footage of George Floyd’s arrest in Minneapolis has been leaked, revealing Floyd was in significant distress – and possibly intoxicated – long before Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. One of the videos, which reportedly came from the body camera of Minneapolis officer Thomas Lane, starts with the cops pulling Floyd over and ends with their efforts to push the increasingly panicked 46-year-old security guard into a squad car. Theother– much longer, extending over 18 minutes and allegedly taken from the body camera of Officer Alexander Kueng – starts inside the store where Floyd allegedly tried to pass a counterfeit bill and ends with police discussing the arrival of the ambulance as they restrain Floyd on the ground. While neither clip, originally obtained by the Daily Mail, includes scenes of graphic violence, they are nevertheless difficult to watch. Floyd repeatedly pleads for his life and begs for his mother, asking the cops if they plan to shoot him and insisting that he’s claustrophobic and can’t sit in the police car. The officers attempt to mollify him, promising to roll down the windows, in between asking him if he’s taken any drugs and accusing him of behaving erratically. The clip from Kueng’s bodycam provides an alternate camera angle on police restraining Floyd on the ground – the infamous“I can’t breathe”sequence that shocked the world when it initially surfaced on social media over two months ago. It’s clear from both clips, however, that Floyd was in distress long before he ended up face-down on the asphalt. Repeatedly insisting he’s“not that kind of guy,”the stricken security guard protests“I can’t breathe”and“I don’t wanna die weird”as the officers attempt to stuff his handcuffed body into the squad car. Floyd even volunteers to lie on the ground instead, though at this point in the arrest the cops struggle to push, pull, and otherwise wrestle him into the vehicle. Lawyers for the four officers charged with Floyd’s murder have for weeks argued the bodycam footage should be made public, insisting it provides necessary context for the decision to restrain Floyd on the ground using the controversial knee hold. While transcripts of the Memorial Day arrest made public last month already revealed Floyd had asked to“lay on the ground,”hearing the words in his own voice in between sobs coming from a grown man is viscerally unsettling. According to that transcript, Floyd subsequently began beating his face against the squad car window, causing blood and foam to come from his mouth and renewing officers’ suspicions he was on drugs. Neither video shows this moment. An autopsy indicated Floyd died of cardiac arrest, adding that heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use may have contributed to his untimely death. One of the cops on Kueng’s bodycam footage says he“believes”Floyd was high, noting they“found a weed pipe”and“there might be something else… PCP or something.” While parts of the video seem to vindicate at least some of the police officers’ behavior, other parts provide ammunition for police abolition advocates. Floyd’s ex-girlfriend, a passenger in the car, tells the police he is mentally unstable (“he’s got a thing going on”) regarding police and has been shot before, suggesting his erratic behavior could be a panic attack triggered by cops sticking a gun in his face. Police abolitionists often argue cops are responsible for responding to mental health incidents they lack the training to handle and frequently do more harm than good. Officer Lane, whose attorney has attempted to have the case against his client for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter dismissed, can be heard asking if the cops should roll Floyd on his side, stating he is“worried”about“the excited delirium or whatever.”Chauvin can be heard reassuring his colleague that the ambulance is on its way and Floyd is“staying where we’ve got him.” The original video of Floyd’s arrest, filmed by one of the horrified bystanders who witnessed Chauvin kneel on the security guard’s neck for eight minutes, inspired months of protests against police brutality and racism across the US and in dozens of other countries. The demonstrations have occasionally turned violent at the hands of police or protesters, even spiraling into looting and arson, though the majority have remained peaceful. Floyd’s death also catapulted the little-known police abolition movement to national prominence, with initiatives underway from New York to Minneapolis to defund or even disband police forces. Such initiatives have met with intense pushback from the Trump administration, which has vowed“never”to defund the police. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/497006-george-floyd-leaked-bodycam-footage/
"3 Aug, 2020",Portland records highest number of monthly murders in ‘OVER 30 YEARS’ as city slashes police budget,"Portland saw the highest number of homicides in July in more than three decades, officials say. The uptick in violence has strained police resources, which have already suffered from budget cuts. The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) is investigating 15 murders that occurred in July, making the month one of the deadliest for the city in recent memory, local newspaper the Oregonian reported. The city has registered 24 homicides so far this year, meaning that last month alone accounted for more than half of the city’s violent deaths in 2020. July also saw 63 shootings, compared to 28 during the same month last year, the PPB said. Police Chief Chuck Lovell expressed concern that the surge in murders was thinning out limited police resources, as officers who would normally patrol the city had been reassigned to help with investigations. The increase in murders coincided with the city council’s decision to shave more than $15 million from the PPB’s budget. The budget cuts, which took effect on July 1, led to the disbanding of police units that work in schools, investigate gun violence, and patrol the city’s public transport system. Lovell suggested that the loss of the city’s 34-member Gun Violence Reduction Team was particularly regrettable. The budget cuts were part of an ongoing nationwide movement to“defund”the police, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police. Portland is still reeling from demonstrations that have been held every night for more than two months. The protests became increasingly violent in July after federal agents were deployed to protect the city’s federal courthouse. A deal between the state of Oregon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has called for the federal forces to be replaced by state and local law enforcement, which will likely place further strain on the city’s police.

Forward and ordained minister Isaac was the first NBA star not to kneel during the national anthem as part of the blacklivesmatter movement, standing in his team colors while his teammates observed the gesture in T-shirts bearing the name of the campaign. He explained that""black lives are supported through the gospel""before enduring an agonizing end to Magic s win over Sacramento Kings on Sunday, collapsing to the floor and leaving the court in a wheelchair with what proved to be a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.

"3 Aug, 2020",KFC gets deep-fried after posting ‘black power’ chicken drumstick to commemorate Trinidad’s Emancipation Day,"KFC Trinidad was grilled by angry social media users after the fast food chain marked a holiday celebrating the end of slavery with a BLM-inspired chicken ad. The company later apologized for the post. The chicken chain’s Trinidad subsidiary apparently wanted to show solidarity during the Caribbean nation’s Emancipation Day, which commemorates the end of slavery in the colonies of the British Empire. In an Instagram post, KFC Trinidad showed a chicken drumstick with the silhouette of a ‘black power’ fist that has been recently popularized by the blacklivesmatter movement.“Happy Emancipation Day,” the graphic read. It wasn’t long before the post caught the attention of internet users. “This is the most racist thing I’ve seen a corporation do ever, how tone deaf are they?”askedoneoutraged Twitter user. Otherssaidthe graphic was“distasteful”and“stupid.” One observer argued that while the post would likely be considered racist in the United States or Europe, it matches the“sense of humor”in Trinidad and Tobago. In case y’all didn’t realize, the website sayshttps://t.co/b8RXhA9FWE(the .tt means Trinidad and Tobago). This would of been made by Caribbean people and is right up their alley for sense of humour in Trinidad. Now if this ad been made in USA or europe, then yes it’d be racist Following the outcry, the company pulled the Instagram message and replaced it with an apology. “Our intention was to support and recognise the importance of this historically significant event. We recognise that our posts commemorating Emancipation Day drew some negative responses. Clearly, we got it wrong and we want to unreservedly apologise for the offence caused,”the statement read. A post shared by KFC (TT) (@kfc.tt)onAug 1, 2020 at 5:05pm PDT Many people thought that the apology was unnecessary, however. “I honestly found the post creative...so I’m either missing the issue or it was blown out of proportion,”read one of the top-liked replies on Instagram. KFC is far from alone in taking heat for publishing social media posts deemed racially insensitive. Responding to the anti-racist demonstrations sweeping the United States following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police, Popeyes Chicken tweeted that the restaurant chain would be“nothing without Black Lives.”It later pulled the tweet and replaced it with a message vowing to use its platform to support the BLM movement.

STATEMENT FROM MAYOR TED WHEELER: I m pleased the Governor and the Multnomah County Sheriff responded favorably to my request for mutual aid to implement the great planning work Portland Police have done to be ready for this weekend s potential protests. The additional resources provided by the state police will go a long way to ensuring we are able to do everything possible to be ready when alt-right and white nationalist groups come to our city.We all agree our state and our nation are facing unprecedented threats. I want our entire community to know - first and foremost - our shared priority is to ensure and protect the safety and well-being of everyone in the face of rampant divisiveness and ongoing violence. Having a unified command structure uniting the resources of the state, the county and the city is a timely and appropriate response to the threat we face.I categorically condemn violence of all kinds by all people. But let me be clear, the alt-right and white supremacist groups organizing to come to Portland on Saturday present the greatest threat we ve faced so far.These groups embody and empower racism, intolerance and hate. Those are not Portland values, and they are not welcome here. Hate has no home in Portland. They have actively threatened violence against elected officials and others in our community.For Saturday to remain peaceful, we need everyone s help - the state, the county and the community. We must stand together, and we are. Together, we can prevent white nationalists from achieving their goals of spreading fear and intimidation and of misrepresenting Portland for political gain.We will always support the rights of people to peacefully assemble. And we will always stand against those who provoke violence, regardless of their beliefs.Again, I want to thank the Oregon State Police and the Multnomah County Sheriff for their support. Because of their leadership, combined with that of Portland Police Chief Lovell, I m hopeful everyone will stay safe this weekend. I also want to thank the City of Milwaukie and the City of Lake Oswego, who also responded to our request for additional officers and support.Finally, I know there s a lot of interest in the use of tear gas. My order banning the Portland Police from using tear gas for crowd control remains in place.This weekend don t give out of town racists and bullies the satisfaction of distracting us, or slowing us down. Let s keep our focus on what s important and keep pressing forward together. And once again, thanks to our partners for responding to our request for mutual aid under these extraordinary circumstances.

"2 Aug, 2020",‘Do as they say’: Minneapolis police warn people to obey criminals for their own safety as violent crime surges amid BLM protests,"Embattled Minneapolis police are advising residents on survival skills amid a wave of violent crime, offering such tips as “be prepared to give up your cell phone and purse/wallet” to robbers and “do not walk alone.” “Do not argue or fight with the criminal,”police said in a July 28letterto Third Precinct residents.“Do what they say. Your safety is most important.” The Third Precinct, southeast of downtown, was one of the areas hardest hit by the protests-turned-riots that broke out following the May 25 killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Ensuing demonstrations and riots in the adjoining cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul marked the second-most destructive incident of civil unrest in US history. Police wereforced to abandontheir Third Precinct headquarters for their own safety on May 28 as rioters pulled down a fence and set the building on fire. Minneapolis City Government tells residents to be ready to give up their phones and wallets and to always cooperate with criminals:pic.twitter.com/qQhw4YLRSY Carjackings and other robberies have skyrocketed in the wake of the blacklivesmatter protests. Police said there were 20 carjackings and 100 other robberies reported in July in the Third Precinct alone.“Some victims have been maced, dragged, assaulted and some threatened with a gun,”police said in the warning to locals. In an era of rising crime and a push by many on the left to defund police and“reimagine”law enforcement in Democrat-controlled cities, the self-help tips in Minneapolis may be a sign of things to come. The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously in June to replace the city s police department with a“department of community safety and violence prevention, which will have responsibility for public safety services prioritizing a holistic, public health-oriented approach.” The plan will need approval from voters in November, meaning it will primarily affect police resources after 2020, but the city last month took $1.1 million out of this year s police budget to fund a Health Department program in which staff are sent out to“mediate”violent conflicts. Some Minneapolis residents are already adjusting to deteriorating public safety by setting up armed patrols in their neighborhoods. Minneapolis police are operating under a court order that bans such tactics as choke holds and requires that any use of rubber bullets or other crowd-control measures be approved by the police chief. More than 150 officers filed disability claims for post-traumatic stress disorder and other injuries suffered during the protests. In Seattle, where officers were banned altogether from using crowd-control weapons, Police Chief Carmen Best warned business owners last month that her department would have“no ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.” Seattle City Council members introduced aresolutionFriday to create a new community safety department that would replace much of the police force. Police also have been restrained by city leaders in Portland, which had 15 reported homicides in July, the highest monthly total in more than three decades. There were 63 shootings reported through the first 29 days of July, police data showed, up from 28 in all of July 2019. Newsmax journalist John Cardillo, a former New York City policeman, saidin a tweetthat the Minneapolis letter essentially tells residents to“prepare to be robbed, obey criminals and hand over their belongings. This is where we are now.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/496922-minneapolis-police-obey-criminals/
"1 Aug, 2020",Is it still about the shoes? Nike’s latest ad builds on the company’s tradition of slickly-edited propaganda & hypocrisy,"What have skateboarding Muslims and kneeling quarterbacks got in common? They’re all part of the same social justice struggle, according to Nike. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Woke Capitalism is at it again. Released on Thursday, Nike’s ‘You Can’t Stop Us’ ad is simultaneously an editing marvel (its editors reportedly sifted through 4,000 hours of footage to get those split-screens and transitions right) and an unknowing parody of woke culture. No scene illustrates Woke Capital™’s hunger for all things intersectional than a shot featuring a skateboarding girl in a niqab (is this what you call Radical Islam?) seamlessly morphing into a leather-jacketed transsexual holding a smoking rainbow flag. Entire books could be written about this 4 second clip from the new nike adpic.twitter.com/dIadAMlfde The ad has racked up more than 25 million views and has been lauded as an aesthetic masterpiece. It’s easy to see why. The combination of inspiring music, sublime editing, and beautiful cinematography makes you want to cheer, until you consider how utterly ridiculous the scene is. Is Nike suggesting that religious teachings that oppress and degrade women are somehow empowering? Or is the young skater’s transition into LBGT activist a sign of what awaits Muslim societies in a woke-ified world? Whatever the answer, perhaps the Uighur Muslims reportedlyslavingaway in Nike’s Chinese factories will finally feel represented, no matter how Haram the imagery. From black women overcoming some ill-defined doubt, to athletes of all colors taking a knee for ‘ blacklivesmatter ’, to soccer star and perennial liberal narcissist Megan Rapinoe pontificating on making the world a“better place,”no ethnic or social splinter group is left unmentioned in this 90-second compendium of wokeness. The ad is right about one thing for sure: Woke Capital can’t be stopped. It can’t be stopped from absorbing, packaging, and profiting off righteousness. Walmart won’t pay its staff a living wage, yet pledged $100 million in June to open a“center focused on racial equity.”Apple, another corporation that uses Chineseslave laborto manufacture its products, kicked in the same amount to eradicate racism. McDonald’s, whose restaurants havecontributedto black America’s shocking 75 percent obesity rate, has taken up the niche cause of black trans rights, for some reason. “Black trans women have a very simple message: stop killing us” -@imarajoneshttps://t.co/KLsZbLzH7ipic.twitter.com/F7IGLPlAK4 Nike, however, is the undisputed king of wokevertising. From making anthem-kneeling quarterback Colin Kaepernick the face of its 2018 ‘Believe in Something’ campaign, to wheeling out amoralizing sermonon race relations just four days after George Floyd’s death, the company has evidently figured out that crises sell more shoes (and more breathablesports hijabstoo). Selling shoes must be Nike’s aim, because the alternative is twice as bizarre. That alternative is that Nike, a global megacorporation whose pockets are lined with the profits of slave labor, has appointed itself chief propagandist for a movement to dismantle the power structure of America on behalf of the ‘oppressed’ women, blacks and Muslims of the world.

"1 Aug, 2020","Portland man faces up to 20 years in prison after throwing explosive at federal courthouse, ID d by vest his grandma bought him","A young man in Portland faces up to 20 years in prison on arson charges, accused of hurling a bomb at a courthouse amid ongoing police brutality protests. He was identified by a tactical vest gifted to him by his grandmother. Gabriel Agard-Berryhill, 18, was charged with arson on Friday, the US Attorney’s Office in Oregon announced in a statement. The man is said to have thrown“a large explosive device”at a federal courthouse in Portland during a protest on Tuesday, which prosecutors argue could have“gravely injured law enforcement officers positioned near the courthouse, other protesters standing nearby, or himself.” “The violent opportunists engaged in dangerous acts of violence, such as arson, need to realize there will be grave consequences,”said Russel Burger, a US Marshal. Serious crimes of this nature go beyond mere property damage to the courthouse and endanger people’s lives.

Agard-Berryhill made his first appearance in federal court on Friday, and has since been ordered released“pending further court proceedings.”He faces up to two decades behind bars for the arson charge, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years. Protests have raged in Portland for some two months straight, kicked off amid a wave of similar demonstrations nationwide following the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. The protests have frequently descended into violence, seeing activists clash with law enforcement on a nightly basis for weeks on end as they besiege the city s federal courthouse. Federal agents were deployed to Portland earlier in July to protect historical monuments and other government property, which have become common targets for activists in recent months. Though the agents have struck a withdrawal deal with local authorities, US President Donald Trump has vowed to deploy National Guard troops to the city should the unrest continue, recently slamming the protests as a“beehive of terrorists.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/496820-portland-charged-arson-explosive/
"31 Jul, 2020",Seattle City Council moving to defund racist police department & replace it with ‘community-led public safety system,"Seattle lawmakers are attempting to completely defund the city’s police department and replace it with a new “civilian-led” public safety system in response to ongoing blacklivesmatter protests. The Seattle City Council has already come under fire this week for proposing a 50 percent cut to the police department’s budget — a proposal that prompted hundreds of citizens to express their concerns during a council meeting on Wednesday. Yet, newly revealed legislation now shows that the council may be doing a lot more than simply stripping police of half their funding. Lawmakers are moving to completely abolish the police department and replace it with a system of“civilian-led community safety and violence prevention.” The council argues in the proposal that police in the city perpetuate“racism and violence”and uphold“white supremacy.” The new department must include people with“culturally-relevant expertise rooted in community connections”and use“trauma-informed, gender-affirming, anti-racist praxis,”according to the proposed legislation. The“community-led”system would mainly focus on“housing, food security, and other basic needs.”It would also employ social service workers and require anyone working under this new system to“live in the community they service.” The council endorses the ""Decriminalize Seattle"" agenda that would replace the police force with:–""Culturally-relevant expertise rooted in community connections""–""Housing, food security, and other basic needs""–""Trauma-informed, gender-affirming, anti-racist praxis""pic.twitter.com/shtCgAIQTl The council said the proposal was motivated by the ongoing blacklivesmatter protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis. Seattle is one of many cities to see BLM protests turn violent, with both civilians and police being assaulted. Federal agents were deployed to Portland, Oregon after demonstrators attempted to burn down the federal courthouse. On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to send in the National Guard if rioting continues. The Seattle proposal also calls for“underutilized public land”to be transferred to“BIPOC community ownership,”BIPOC standing for Black, Indigineous, and People of Color. It’s not clear when the city council will vote on the new legislation, but a majority of its members have expressed support for at least defunding the police. The radical proposal to replace the whole department with a community-led initiative immediately raised eyebrows on social media, with many seeing only disaster in the city’s future if they go through with the plan. One suggested the move would surely result in the“immediate collapse of public order.” This is madness. If Seattle moves forward with its plan to abolish the police and permanently close the region s largest jail, it will lead to the immediate collapse of public order. But for now, the political class is following the mob. Beware. JUST IN: Seattle City Council isn’t just voting to ‘Defund Police’ they are moving to Abolish the entire Seattle Police Department.This isn’t satire.They are abolishing@SeattlePDand creating a new department of “Community Safety & Violence Prevention.”pic.twitter.com/h5r9LfHe1g The level of public support for the dramatic proposal is unclear, but a recent poll found that over 50 percent of residents supported slashing the police department’s budget in half.

"31 Jul, 2020",Trump vows to deploy National Guard to quell Portland s ‘beehive of terrorists’ if feds fail to stop unrest by ‘tomorrow’,"US President Donald Trump said he would send National Guard troops to quell chaotic protests in Portland, condemning activists there as a “beehive of terrorists,” as federal units deployed to the city prepare to withdraw. Trump warned of a National Guard deployment during a Thursday press conference, one day after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck a deal with Oregon Governor Kate Brown to phase out federal police stationed in Portland, where they’ve worked with local authorities to defend a federal courthouse and other government property. Though the withdrawal was set to begin on Thursday, the president said National Guard troops would effectively replace the federal agents should the unrest continue. “Our people are staying there to see whether they can do it today and tomorrow, and if they don’t do it we will send in the National Guard, and we’ll take care of it,”Trump said, labeling the protesters“professional anarchists”and“people who hate our country.” We’re telling them right now, that we’re coming in very soon, the National Guard… So [federal agencies are] working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. “These are people that hate our country.”Trump says if local law enforcement in Portland doesn’t disperse “this beehive of terrorists,"" he will send in the National Guardpic.twitter.com/DHjLiR019T As part of the federal withdrawal deal, Portland law enforcementcleared outtwo large protester encampments set up in city parks on Thursday morning, as the spaces are located near federal properties that have been under siege by demonstrators for more than two months, including the courthouse. The protests have frequently become violent, seeing regularclashesbetween activists and police, with some demonstrators arming themselves with improvised weapons andsmallexplosives. Police have also come under fire for heavy-handed tactics, with federal agents accused of wielding excessive force and“kidnapping”protesters off the street, using unmarked vehicles. Despite the agreement, DHS chief Chad Wolf said the withdrawal would only proceed once the agency is confident federal properties will be secure, leaving some question as to when the de-escalation will actually take place. Wolf noted that“we anticipate the ability to change our force posture”in Portland once conditions on the ground“significantly improve.” Federal agents were deployed to Portland earlier this month as part of a new multi-agency task force created by executive order in June, which aims to protect statues, historical monuments and other federal buildings. Such government properties have become common targets for anti-police brutality activists in recent months, amid a wave of mass protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in May.

"29 Jul, 2020",Governor says ‘occupying force’ that brought ‘violence’ to Portland is LEAVING – DHS says feds will stay until order restored,"Oregon’s governor claims she reached a deal with the Trump administration that will see a withdrawal of federal agents that were sent to Portland after a courthouse was attacked, but DHS says they are staying until violence stops. “After discussions with the vice president and administration officials this week, the federal government has agreed to my demand and will withdraw these officers from Portland,”Oregon’s Governor Kate Brown said. Part of the agreement will involve state troopers providing protection for federal buildings like the Mark O. Hatfield US Courthouse, which is where federal agents had been deployed after protesters attempted to burn it down, she added. In her announcement, Brown called the federal authorities an“occupying force”and claimed they“brought violence”to the city, despite the fact that they were only deployed in the first place because protests had turned to rioting and damage to federal property. Our local Oregon State Police officers will be downtown to protect Oregonians right to free speech and keep the peace. Let s center the blacklivesmatter movement s demands for racial justice and police accountability. It s time for bold action to reform police practices. Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad Wolf announced in his own statement about the agreement that there will be a“robust presence”of Oregon State Police in downtown Portland to ensure federal buildings and law enforcement officers do not become the targets of blacklivesmatter protesters. “The violent criminal activity directed towards federal properties and law enforcement will not be tolerated, state and local leaders must step forward and police their communities,”Wolfsaid, warning that the Department of Homeland Security will not tolerate such“criminal behavior.” In later tweets, Wolf clarified that federal agents will not be leaving until they know local authorities can properly protect law enforcement officers and federal property. “We will maintain our current, augmented federal law enforcement personnel in Portland until we are assured that the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and other federal properties will no longer be attacked and that the seat of justice in Portland will remain secure,”he wrote. Wolf alsosaidhe is glad Oregon is“correcting their months-long error.” As I told the Governor yesterday, federal law enforcement will remain in Portland until the violent activity toward our federal facilities ends. We are not removing any law enforcement while our facilities and law enforcement remain under attack. Hours before Brown’s announcement, President Donald Trump told the press at the White House that federal agents would not be leaving“until they secure their city”and warned that if it was not“secure soon,”the federal government will have no choice but to“go in and clean it out.” Trump on Portland: ""We re not leaving until they secure their city ... if they don t secure their city soon, we have no choice -- we re gonna have to go in and clean it out.""pic.twitter.com/y9xg1fhnnO The president later doubled down on these thoughts in tweets claiming“there would be no Portland”if the federal government had not stepped in, and they will do so again if Brown and Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler,“do not stop the crime and violence.” ...do not stop the Crime and Violence from the Anarchists and Agitators immediately, the Federal Government will go in and do the job that local law enforcement was supposed to do! This comes less than a day after Attorney General William Barr’s tense hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee, where several Democrats questioned Barr’s decision to deploy federal authorities to the city of Portland, accusing agents of excessive force and of violating the rights of demonstrators.

"29 Jul, 2020",Why is wokeness the only protected religion in America?,"With a law being proposed by the Senate to withhold Covid relief funds to states that discriminate against the religious, a question needs to be asked.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC The First Amendment of the American Constitution outlines that the Government will not show favoritism for or against any religion. As such, persecution against religious groups is decidedly unconstitutional. Keep in mind that the Puritans were fleeing England for America for exactly that reason. However, with the Covid-19 situation we’ve seen quite a bit of hammering down on religious services. Gatherings of the Church of Woke, however, don’t get such scrutiny. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the SACRED act (Safeguarding Americans from Coronavirus and Religious Exercise Discrimination) that would withhold Covid-19 relief funds from states that have hammered on the religious for exercise of religion. This would include situations such as Jews being finedduringa New Jersey funeral for not practicing“proper”social distancing. In another example, a drive-thru Christian church service in Mississippi saw people being ticked $500 each for attending. There is now a lawsuit being filed against the police for this action. Keep in mind they stayed in their cars. There was also the situation ofRodney Howard, though his case was much earlier during the pandemic, bringing much more scrutiny. Many churches were forced to shut down by the government, and as a response President Trumpdeclaredthem essential in May. Meanwhile, the NFL has banned players from going to churches withmorethan a 25 percent occupancy. But here’s the issue: they are allowed to go to blacklivesmatter demonstrations, where social distancing is not practiced. In fact, the official NFL Twitter account has promoted this. Leonard Fournette of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jameis Winston of the New Orleans Saints, and Dwayne Haskins of the Washington Football Team (formerly the Redskins) have been supported by theNFLinthis. .@JaguarsRB Leonard Fournette organized a peaceful protest in Jacksonville yesterday. 🙌 (via@_fournette)pic.twitter.com/wzTSk85Dty And here’s the question: why does the Church of Woke get special treatment? It’s not an official religion, but it’s picking up the trappings of one, fast. America MagazinecomparedGeorge Floyd to Jesus Christ. There are saints, the likes of Portland’s ‘Naked Athena.’ There are sins: thou shalt not misgender, thou shalt not utter ‘All Lives Matter,’ thou shalt not doubt the inherent racism of being white. Sinners are punished via cancel culture, the modern-day crucifixion via social media. Icomparedthem to the Inquisition for a reason. No matter what your political leanings, if you“sin”before this church they will destroy you. No forgiveness. Several city and state governments within the United States appear to have applied for jobs in the woke clergy. Bill De Blasio, the mayor of New York, allows for blacklivesmatter protests but everything else is banned. He’s also been hard on the Jewish community for having gatherings, in a blatant show of favoritism for his own ideology. My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period. These are the situations that the First Amendment is supposed to protect against. Here in the United States, we may be majority Christian but we have a belief that people should be free to worship as they choose. As long as the rights of others aren’t violated, there shouldn’t be a problem. However, as cities burn and businesses are destroyed, some want to hammer down on peaceful religious practitioners instead of violent rioters. Though I’ll admit being fed to lions would be worse, I live in a nation that is supposed to honor that right to belief. It’s time to cash in on the promissory note.

"29 Jul, 2020",The disappointing reality of Portland’s ‘Naked Athena’: ‘Revolutionaries’ thought-police themselves into apologizing,"When the Portland protester anointed ‘Naked Athena’ told her story, the soaring narratives grafted onto her by eager journalists were laid bare as aspirational fiction. But the same could be said for the whole BLM ‘movement.’ is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter@velocirapture23and onTelegram Naked Athena, a sex worker named Jen in“real life,”stunned the nation when images circulated of her cavorting in nothing but a knit cap and face mask as Portland police fired pepper balls at her bare feet. The same officers appeared to turn tail and flee when confronted by her exposed genitalia as she sat down spread-eagled on the pavement. Whatever one thought of the stunt, the footage was arresting. Jen was hailed as“the hero our country needs now”as writers scrambled to project their own ideas about the demonstrations in Portland and across the country onto her nude flesh, practically drooling over the literal blank slate they’d been presented with. Storytellers know a hook when they see one, and the naked lady performing what looked like interpretive dance (or ballet, or yoga poses, depending on the writer) in front of heavily armed riot cops was nothing if not a hook. Then Jen had to go and spoil it by giving an interview to Portland’s Unrefined Sophisticates podcast, in which she revealed her ‘protest’ was based on nothing more than a spur of the moment decision to strip off. Admitting“there wasn’t a lot of thought that went into it,”she told the podcast host“there’s almost not anywhere that you can’t find me naked.”While she propped up that somewhat anticlimactic explanation by adding“my nakedness is political,”and suggesting the stunt came from a“deep feminine place”within her that“felt provoked”by cops fronting like they were warriors, the absence of transcendent political declarations issuing forth from this stranger-dubbed Goddess of Wisdom was a bit of aletdown. Jen seemed to sense this, and sought to explain herself further. Her“message,”she said, was“we’re all out here, these protesters, [and] the only thing we have in common is, we have masks on and we’re out here at night. None of these people have weapons. Empty their pockets, take off their clothes – nobody has weapons here.” Later, she summed it up more succinctly:“I just wanted to make some feds uncomfortable.” It wasn’t the Earth-shattering statement we’d been led to expect from fawning article after sycophantic tweet hailing her as Lady Godiva, Joan of Arc, and, well, Athena rolled into one. But it’s probably unfair – not to mention unrealistic – to expect real-life Jen to deliver an explanation worthy of the icon she spawned. Jen even told the podcasters she thinks of ‘Naked Athena’ as a figure separate from herself and talks about“her”in the third person. After all, the lack of a considered political manifesto behind her stunt mirrors the lack of direction behind the demonstrations that have seized the nation’s attention (with a lot of help from the media establishment) for the past two months. The establishment’s official storytellers would have us believe the massive protests that broke out following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis were a spontaneous yet coherent and unified popular outcry against entrenched American racism – and indeed this narrative has been used to shove a stilted, corporate-safe parody of“tolerance”down the nation’s throat, characterized by self-flagellating seminars on“White Fragility”and groveling apologies for ‘insensitive’ social media posts. But the reality is much messier. A huge number of Americans driven half-mad with cabin fever over months of coronavirus lockdown saw in the protests a chance to escape, to get outside and socialize while venting the socially-unacceptable rage that had built up over job losses, sudden poverty, and the very real, very damaging isolation from loved ones imposed by cruel and stupid government policies. Are they anti-racist? Sure, most people abhor racism, no matter what the media claims. Are they against police violence? Of course – even many police officers were repulsed by the brutal video of Floyd’s killing. But the majority of so-called“anti-fascist”protesters would be unable to cough up a coherent definition of the fascism they’re supposedly fighting against, or explain how the government of President Donald Trump embodies it more than, say, Barack Obama or George W. Bush. They’re no more able to articulate how“fascism”supposedly sprung fully-formed from Trump’s spray-tanned forehead in 2016 than Jen was able to muster the expert social justice babble hermediabiographers indirectly demanded of her with theircall-outs(the irony of a Times or WaPo writer calling someoneelseprivileged notwithstanding). While insisting she’d tried to“educate herself”about how her stunt would have gone down differently had she been darker-skinned or heftier, her attempts to apologize for her“privilege”(as a“non-black person of color”who apparently identified as white most of her life) came across even more stilted than the usual white mea culpas. Jen literally begged forgiveness for her erstwhile whiteness while acknowledging her stunt had briefly eclipsed the larger protests:“I am sorry for taking part in a society for so long that was built on principles of separation and oppression for financial gain. I’m sorry it took me this long to get around to the aspects of understanding that I hadn’t gotten around to yet,”she intoned in between self-administered cracks of the mental whip. I truly apologize for any harm, any feelings of sadness or grief or anger that my actions might have caused. Her clumsy apology was nominally addressed to black people who might have felt upstaged by her nudity, but she might as well have been apologizing to the oppressive system she was supposedly protesting. With that statement, Jen effectively joined the drab, cowed masses scanning the headlines for ideas on what to feel guilty about next, and utterly neutered, even negated her own protest. Her media critics might be happy (though they’ll doubtless find fault with her groveling), but any rebellious spirit onlookers might have glimpsed in her gutsy demonstration was effectively tamed. It wasn’t the Portland riot cops or President Donald Trump who made her meekly bend the knee, either – she did so preemptively, beaten down by her own internal thought police. ‘Naked Athena’ – silent, bold, defiant – might have inspired other rebels, but Jen – who came off as an inveterate rule-follower under her free-spirited sexually-liberated patter – certainly won’t. It’s her right to tell her story, of course, but the disappointing reality behind the largely-fictitious icon reveals just how much a successful uprising relies on skilled storytellers to uplift the masses – and how those same storytellers can keep them down. If the people crying out for change in the streets are at the same time cringing back in fear, preemptively apologizing lest something they do or say hurt the feelings of a more oppressed group, they will remain forever ineffective. This state of fear-based paralysis is precisely where the narrative-managers want them – and where the Trump administration wants them. Any suggestion these forces are at odds is laughable. The protesters (indeed, all Americans) have a lot to be angry about – entire generations have been occluded from the American Dream – but casting everything in terms of race litters the proverbial playing field with broken glass and land mines and guarantees few will be brave enough to take the first step toward a genuine, multiracial class consciousness. The revolution will not be apologized for. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/496526-portland-naked-athena-blm/

"28 Jul, 2020", An assault on the US govt : AG Barr says anarchists hijacked legitimate protests to sow chaos & destruction,"US Attorney General Bill Barr said that “violent anarchists” have transformed peaceful anti-police-brutality protests into riots, singling out ongoing demonstrations in Portland as an outright “assault” on the government itself. The comments came in Barr’sopening statementfor an upcoming committee hearing this week, pre-released on Monday, in which the AG condemned those helping to stoke violence and unrest amid the protests. “In the wake of George Floyd’s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims,”Barr wrote, citing Portland as a“telling example,”where he said a“mob of hundreds of rioters”have“laid siege”to a federal courthouse every night for the past two months. What unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called a protest; it is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States. The AG noted that protesters in the city show up each night“equipped for a fight, armed with powerful slingshots, tasers, sledgehammers, saws, knives, rifles, and explosive devices,”adding that they had recently thrown“commercial-grade fireworks”into the courthouse“in an apparent attempt to burn it down with federal personnel inside.” While Barr said that African Americans still have legitimate concerns about institutionalized racism and an“understandable”distrust of police, he argued the ongoing unrest amounts to“brazen acts of lawlessness,”which could not be justified by concerns over police misconduct, no matter how severe. The attorney general also took aim at the response to the protests from the media and some elected officials, saying many had“remarkably”blamed the federal government for the unrest, despite what he deemed an“organized assault”by activists. The Trump administration has come under fire for its handling of the protests – namely its deployment of federal agents in Portland and elsewhere to defend historical monuments and other government property from vandals – with allegations that officers have unleashed excessive force and made questionable arrests without proper identification. Barr, however, insisted that“peaceful protesters do not throw explosives into federal courthouses,”arguing that rioting would not be tolerated. At the very least, we should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners.

"28 Jul, 2020"," Never Forget ?: When it comes to 9/11 anniversary ceremony, honoring the fallen must take a backseat to Covid-19 precautions","Family members of the victims of September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks won t be allowed to read the names of their fallen loved ones at this year s anniversary event due to coronavirus, as blacklivesmatter protests rumble on. ByTony Cox, a US journalist who has edited or written for Bloomberg and several major daily newspapers. It turns out that the live readings – easily the most poignant part of the annual ceremony in memory of the nearly 3,000 people that were killed in the terrorist attacks – are deemed too dangerous in the Covid-19 era. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum said Friday in a letter to families of the victims that recorded readings will be used instead“out of an abundance of caution and in line with the guidance regarding social distancing.” The decision sounds nonsensical on its face. The families are still invited to gather at the event; they just can t give their tributes on stage. Does the virus spread more easily at an extra three feet of elevation? But put in context, the move is another galling brick in the wall of coronavirus absurdities inflicted on Americans by their leaders. Think about the things that the likes of Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Mario Cuomo have decided are safe and the things that are unsafe. Throughout their lockdowns,“essential services”such as abortion clinics and liquor stores just had to be kept open. Even today, in the last of four phases in the reopening process, church services, gyms and indoor restaurant dining remain banned. Elective surgeries, including such critical procedures as joint replacements, were halted for two months. This kind of crisis reveals which things are important to our rulers and which ones aren t so much. For instance, keeping abortions and tax-generating liquor and lottery ticket sales going was absolutely necessary. September 11 remembrance is not a priority. Anyone who was in New York in the aftermath of the attacks can probably recall the eerie feeling of seeing those“Never Forget”signs and murals. It was almost unimaginable then that anyone would need to be reminded of that horrific day. But“Never Forget”seems to have gone out of fashion. What s really hot today is blacklivesmatter . There was no“abundance of caution”to be found as massive crowds of anti-racism protesters demonstrated across the nation after a black Minneapolis man, George Floyd, was killed in police custody on May 25. The BLM protests were the most essential of essential services. Many of the protesters were maskless, and many of their“largely peaceful”demonstrations escalated into riots and looting. Minneapolis and St. Paul suffered what Governor Tim Walz called the second-most destructive incident of civil unrest in US history. But not to worry. The BLM protests were to be embraced. De Blasio even helped paint the BLM mural covering the street in front of Trump Tower. Public health officials who had been admonishing the rest of us about social distancing saw too much merit in the BLM protests to stand in the way. Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo tweeted,“In this moment, the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.” We should always evaluate the risks and benefits of efforts to control the virus. In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.https://t.co/s9DagyjQ1J The hypocrisy made a mockery of the coronavirus restrictions that continue to be imposed on the rest of us. It made the seemingly arbitrary rules appear like Public Health Theater. Being told now that reading the names of September 11 terror victims and heroes is unsafe makes the script even less believable. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/496021-911-memorial-covid-precautions/
"27 Jul, 2020","What would Shakespeare say? Rutgers takes a knee to blacklivesmatter , declares English grammar ‘racist’","The English Department at Rutgers University said it would ‘stand with’ BLM by focusing on ‘racism in the classroom,’ evidenced by the emphasis on grammar. Will colleges prove more destructive than the riots just witnessed? Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge It appears that the fallout from the BLM and Antifa riots following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white cop were not only the torched and looted city center of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Today, the ‘violence’ continues to spread like wildfire from the manicured lawns of one of America’s oldest colleges. Last month, in an effort to demonstrate camaraderie with the BLM/Antifa movement, Rebecca Walkowitz, Chair of the English Department at Rutgers, sent a 3,000+ wordemailto her colleagues that addresses, among other things, “racism in the classroom.” Never mind that no proof is provided that such a thing even exists. In addition to mentioning compulsory workshops for faculty and students “who do not live the experience of anti-black racism every day,” as well as new hiring standards that give advantage to “people of color,” the email touched upon a part of the English language that one would not normally associate with “systemic racism.” Under the heading entitled ‘Incorporating critical grammar into our pedagogy,’ Walkowitz said writing instruction “should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard ‘academic’ English backgrounds at a disadvantage.” “Instead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them w/ regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on ‘written’ accents,” the professor continued. In other words, students whose first language is not English, or who come from “non-standard ‘academic English backgrounds” (i.e. Black Americans) should not be unduly ‘punished’ in the classroom for their sub-par writing skills. Instead, they should fall back on a “variety of choices” that empowers them despite their haphazard work. The part where Walkowitz mentions the “biases based on ‘written’ accents” suggests that those “biases” are the failing grades, while the “written accents” is a polite euphemism for ‘mistakes,’ which, in these days of political correctness, nobody is allowed to make. Actually, they are free to make mistakes; it’s just that nobody, not even the teacher, is permitted to draw attention to them. The not-so-subtle argument being pushed is that since English is not the original lingua franca of Black Americans, and other minorities, who have a different native origin and therefore different comprehension of such nuances and should not be expected to suffer. Their grammatical and writing errors are more the fault of the historic colonizer, the dreaded White man, as opposed to their own failings to grasp the rules of the English language. For anyone who thinks that may be reading too much into the message, Walkowitz’s email specifically mentions the creation of workshops that focus on “diversity and equity” in an effort to make the Rutgers writing programs “linguistically diverse and decolonized spaces.” There is only one way to interpret that line – sheer madness. First, ‘linguistics’ is defined as “the scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of grammar, syntax, and phonetics.” Unless Walkowitz is talking about the comparative study of many diverse languages, which she is not, there can be no ‘diversity in linguistics.’ As is the case with every language, indeed, with every science, English follows certain rules that cannot be broken lest we want our written and spoken form of communication to be totally incomprehensible. There can be no divergence from the rules of English any more than there can be a divergence from the rules of baseball. Second, the term “decolonized spaces” suggests that the English language itself is somehow predicated on racism, which of course is utterly ridiculous. At a minimum, such an unfounded assertion may incite actual racism where before there was none; at the worst, arguing in favor of “decolonized spaces” risks altering the English language beyond comprehension since its grammar rules are allegedly symbols of racism. Ironically, such an argument could actually increase the level of misunderstanding between the races if there is no unified form of communication. Instead of two diverse peoples enjoying the unifying power of language to express their ideas, America will be confronted by two diverse groups unable to understand what the other is saying. While such a brilliant idea may work fine inside of the increasingly disconnected college campus, it will flop dismally in a place called ‘the real world.’ Minority and multilingual students may feel ‘empowered’ inside of the classroom when they receive praise for lackluster work, but in the marketplace their products will find no buyers and their expensive education will have been for naught. The social justice warriors are actually peddling their own form of racism by arguing that minority students somehow lack the intellectual ability to adhere to the rule of English grammar. That is wrong, as many famous Black writers – like Toni Morrison, James Baldwin and Alice Walker – attest to. To paraphrase William Shakespeare, the famous British bard, “Thou protest too much.” *Rutgers has not officially stated its endorsement of the measures put forward in the email.

"27 Jul, 2020",Portland sex worker who stripped in front of cops as ‘Naked Athena’ says her nakedness was ‘POLITICAL’,"The woman dubbed ‘Naked Athena’ is a sex worker, and her famous confrontation with Portland police, in nothing but a cap and a face mask, happened because she felt offended by the way they stood, she has revealed in an interview. Identifying herself only as Jen, a sex worker in her 30s, the bare protester said she“felt provoked”in a“very deep feminine place in myself”by the city and federal riot police earlier this month, when she decided to strip off and confront them in naught but her skin. “I looked at them and they stand there with this stance: Feet planted, shoulder width apart, arms at their side, chest up, head high, and it’s a warrior stance... and it’s not earned,”Jen confided to the ‘Unrefined Sophisticates’podcastover the weekend. “There wasn t planning and a lot of thought going into it,”Jen said. She just handed her clothes to her partner, leaving just a beanie and a face mask on, and struck a pose on the street. It was day 50 of the ongoing siege by demonstrators outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon. One journalist sympathetic to the demonstrators dubbed her“Naked Athena”and a legend was born. And then? Naked Athena appeared and the little boys didn’t know what to do.pic.twitter.com/Elo69SsV0t Jen described the confrontation as“really calm and terrifying at the same time,”comparing it to“being in the eye of the storm.”Video and photos from that night show her striking yoga poses and full-frontal-flashing the line of police in riot gear. If one was to trust the media narrative, the presence of“Naked Athena”forced the officers to eventually retreat to the courthouse. Oregon has lax laws on public nudity, and Portland only makes it illegal to strip“in order to arouse,”rather than, say, express a political opinion. “My nakedness is political and it is my expression,”the 30-something confessed, adding she is“notoriously naked”often and pretty much anywhere. Initially billed as peaceful protests against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, demonstrations in Portland have since morphed into riots, with armored activists repeatedly trying to set fire to the federal courthouse.

Antifa, parents groups and other assorted agitators gathered outside Portland’s federal courthouse Sunday for the 60th consecutive night of protests since George Floyd s death in Minneapolis police custody.

"26 Jul, 2020","Riots are driving Portland’s small businesses under, but mainstream media wants to sell you a different story","After nearly 60 straight nights of violence, business owners in Portland are sick and tired of riots. But as their stores go under, the coastal media treats the rioters to glowing coverage and city authorities do nothing. Portland is a liberal stronghold, and as ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ protests fizzle out around the country, anger remains at boiling point in the Oregonian city. The protests there have not been all banner-waving and slogan-chanting affairs though. Instead, droves of ‘Antifa’ types have laid siege to the city’s Justice Center for almost two months, tearing down barricades, lobbing fireworks, setting fires andstabbingeach other. Most of those involved in the riots would probably say they’re fighting police brutality or fascism, or something of the sort, but besides those injured in that fight there are other victims of the unrest – local business owners have repeatedly complained about the riots to the local media. In articles published every few days, these store owners, barmen and restaurateurs describe how the riots have driven them to the brink of bankruptcy. One clothing store manager toldOregon Liveon Saturday that within days of coronavirus restrictions being lifted, he reopened his family’s store, only to watch rioters trash the premises in late May, days after the killing of George Floyd kicked off the season of unrest. Other business owners told the news site that the city’s usually vibrant downtown is“desolate,”with tourism down and even locals giving the city center a wide berth. One bar owner shut down his watering hole in early July, after closing out one day with only $18.75 in sales. “We work very hard to build our businesses and be successful and employ people, and when they come in and destroy it by breaking the window and everything else, we’re the ones who have to pay for that,”one Subway franchise owner told another localnews outletlast week. The police, he said,“haven’t been in touch”in the two months since. The damage is not just limited to broken windows. A jewelry store in downtown Portland was robbed in late May, with looters taking nearly a million dollars worth of jewelry. According to the family who own the store, nobody from the city or state has reached out to them. Mayor Ted Wheeler has pinned the blame for the riots squarely on the federal agents sent in by President Trump three weeks ago to deal with the“anarchists and agitators.”Wheeler claimed last Sunday that“before the federal troops got here, violence was way down, vandalism was way down,”even though the courthouse had been lit on fire days before their deployment, and police had declared three riots in the week beforehand. When Wheeler went downtown on Wednesday to hold a“listening session”with protesters, he was heckled and called a“fascist,”before his own security team whisked him away. Nevertheless, he has remained insistent that any restoration of order begins with the withdrawal of federal agents. While local news tells tales of shuttered stores and bankrupt businesses, national media outlets describe the violence in Portland as a good v evil showdown between protesters and federal“stormtroopers.”As store owners told their stories to local media, the New York Times ran anarticlelast week celebrating the“diverse elements”taking part in the protests. The“mothers in helmets,”and“anti-fascist activists”are“largely peaceful,”the paper wrote, describing how they have been“galvanized”by the“militarized”feds on the streets. The Washington Post was even more effusive in itspraise, describing the feds’ use of tear gas as a“chemical weapon,”and honoring the moms, dads, teachers and healthcare workers who refuse to disperse and willingly stride into the choking fumes. The motives of the protesters – beyond vague demands for“racial justice”– are never explained, but the Post painted a truly heroic image of one man using a leaf blower to fire gas back at the agents. “A man with a leaf blower strapped to his back snuffed out a lit cigarette and sighed. ‘Well,’ he said to himself. ‘Time to get gassed again.’ He revved up the machine, adjusted its straps and marched forward into the gathering fog,”the Post gushed in epic fashion. The Washington Post’s story ends as the brave blower walks into the maelstrom like a doomed war hero of old. But when the Sun rises and the smoke clears, it’ll be regular Portlanders sweeping away the trash, scrubbing the graffiti, and living with the consequences of an activist movement that many say has long forgotten why it started. These citizens may be left on their own for some time by both state and federal officials, if the experience elsewhere is anything to go by. After authorities in Minneapolis ordered their police to stand down and allow rioters to trash the city in May, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz asked the Trump administration for up to half a billion dollars in aid money. The request wasdenied, and residents of the riot-stricken city were left to patch up their looted, broken and burned businesses as best they could.

"25 Jul, 2020",Judge blocks Seattle’s tear gas & crowd control weapons ban as city braces for weekend protests,"A federal judge has overturned a Seattle ordinance that prohibited police from using crowd control weapons. The last-minute decision comes hours after the city’s police chief said the force would be powerless to stop mob violence. US District Judge James Robart blocked the ban, which was put in place by the Seattle City Council, during an emergency hearing on Friday night. The Seattle ordinance, which was set to go into effect this weekend, would have prevented police from using pepper spray, blast balls, and other crowd control weapons. The temporary restraining order on the legislation was made after the US Department of Justice argued that prohibiting Seattle police from using crowd control weapons could actually result in more deadly force being used in situations where law enforcement need to intervene. The city is expected to see large protests in the coming days. In a letter to business owners and residents released hours before the ruling, Police Chief Carmen Best warned that the legislation passed by the city council gives officers“NO ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.” Seattle Police will have an adjusted deployment in response to any demonstrations this weekend – as I will never ask our officers to risk their personal safety to protect property without the tools to do so in a safe way. Seattle has seen numerous protests since the death of George Floyd in May. The city hosted the now-defunct ‘autonomous zone’ in its Capitol Hill neighborhood, which was later disbanded following a string of violence and several deaths. Over the last week, protesters have smashed up and vandalized several businesses in the city. Large protests are expected over the weekend, with a tactical unit of federal agents on standby if the protests spiral into violence or rioting.

"25 Jul, 2020",UN human rights office condemns ‘arbitrary arrests & unnecessary use of force’ amid US police brutality protests,"The United Nations has denounced heavy-handed police tactics used against demonstrators in Portland and other US cities during ongoing protests, taking aim at what it called baseless arrests and unnecessary violence by officers. “Peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place in cities in the US, such as Portland, really must be able to continue without those participating in them... risking arbitrary arrest or detention, being subject to unnecessary, disproportionate or discriminatory use of force, or suffering other violations of their rights,”Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),saidon Friday. Among dozens of locations to see heated police brutality demonstrations in recent weeks, Portland has lately taken the spotlight, with federal agents deployed to the city under authority from the White House to put down unrest and vandalism. The protests have rocked Portland for more than 50 consecutive days, seeing regular clashes with law enforcement as demonstrators gather outside a federal courthouse night after night. While federal authorities say“violent anarchists”are to blame for escalating the protests, activists – as well asPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler– argue the agents are at fault, insisting the demonstrations only ignited into serious unrest after they were deployed to the city. Throssell also voiced concerns about reports that unidentified officers were ‘kidnapping’ protesters off Portland’s streets at random, noting this could“place those detained outside the protection of the law, and may give rise to arbitrary detention and other human rights violations.”The Customs and Border Protection agency, one of the federal bodies deployed in Portland, hasrejectedthe ‘kidnapping’ allegations, maintaining that its agents wear clear identification and only detain those suspected of crimes. An Oregon district judge appeared to challenge that claim on Thursday, however, issuing arestraining orderbarring federal agents from arresting or wielding force against journalists and legal observers. Without the injunction, the judge said agents would continue to“target”reporters, even when they“are not engaged in any harmful or illegal conduct.” Protesters who do experience“unnecessary or excessive use of force”from police must have some means of recourse, the UN spokeswoman went on, calling for“prompt, independent, impartial and transparent investigations into any allegations of human rights violations.” As the demonstrations rage on in Portland and elsewhere, Throssell said the UN’s Human Rights Committee will issue a guidance covering“physical and online protests, public order, and the work of the media”next Wednesday.

"25 Jul, 2020",Nearly HALF of viewers abandon A&E after network cancels hit show ‘Live PD’ to appease anti-police crowd,"The A&E TV network has seen its viewership dive bomb after dropping its popular cop-based reality show ‘Live PD.’ Though the woke move decimated its prime time audience, the channel insists the decline is only “temporary.” Some six weeks after A&E shelved the show – which followed on-duty police officers on patrol in real time – the network’s prime time viewership has tanked by 49 percent, according to Nielsen ratings data first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday. Its total daily average viewership collapsed by more than a third. Though the network labeled the drop as a“temporary hit in the ratings,”the impact has been even greater for a key adult-aged demographic, declining 55 percent for those aged 18 to 49. A&E’s decision to cancel the show last month came amid a wave of anti-police brutality demonstrations, which erupted nationwide following the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement in May. At the time, the company said it would“determine if there is a clear pathway to tell the stories of both the community and the police officers whose role it is to serve them,”noting it would meet with“civil rights leaders as well as police departments”as it reassessed the show. ‘Live PD’ also spawned a number of spin-off shows, all of which were scrapped along with the original series in June. Together, the shows made up 85 percent of A&E’s programming during some weeks. The cancellations have not gone over well with the show’s large fanbase, however, with former viewers taking to social media to demand a revival of the series, some even encouraging a boycott of the channel. A&E has apparently not ruled out bringing the show back, telling the Journal that it is“continuing to listen to both community leaders and ‘Live PD’ fans to find a way to serve both moving forward.” The hit TV show was not the only cop-themed program to get the axe in recent months, with the Paramount Network giving the pink slip to its iconic ‘Cops’ series in June, which ran for a whopping 32 seasons. The onslaught on police-themed shows even triggered a semi-sarcastic rumor that the children’s cartoon ‘Paw Patrol’ was next on the chopping block – a claimechoedin seriousness by the White House spokeswoman as recently as Friday afternoon. A Nickelodeon spokesperson has since dispelled the idea,reassuringits audience the show isn’t going anywhere. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/495815-ae-ratings-tank-live-pd/

Now, it’s become the battleground where liberals and conservatives lock horns. Ever since the blacklivesmatter movement’s resurgence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in the US, there’s been a plethora of petitions to remove statues because of their links to racism and slavery. That movement has been very effective and has received plenty of coverage. Things came to a head when a riled-up crowd in Bristol, UK hauledEdward Colston’slikeness down from a plinth in the city, before tossing him in the river. The pro-keepers are now turning liberals’ petition tactics right back at them, on a worldwide scale. A new websiteNoChange.Orghas sprung up allowing anyone to locate on a map where a petition has been started – and users can click a link to sign a rival petition, advocating the opposite: keeping the statues. New petition added to our website - please sign!Stop Swansea Council renaming street, statues etc without public consenthttps://t.co/fFsQnhGkBF This leads us all to an interesting fork in the road. Petitions are intended to give the people a voice, but which people? You can’t allow one group to have their say without allowing the other to do the same. According to a recent poll, there s a 52-44 percent split in favour of removing Confederate statues in America. This was reported by most news outlets. But on closer inspection, eight out of 10 Republicans are against it, while 85 percent of Democrats support it. Among Independents, the split is 50-46 in favour of removal. When voters were asked, 43 percent said they regarded the Confederate flag as a sign of “Southern Pride”, but this is down from 52 percent in 2015. But US Defense Secretary Mark Esper effectively banned it from Pentagon buildings last week, saying: “The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols.” The situation in Britain is just as polarising, with 71 percent of people against pulling down the statues. Granted, this is not the same as them being orderly removed by the authorities, but even that initiative only received the support of 27 percent of those asked. Another recent British poll found that 65 percent said it was “unfair to make judgments about people in the past based on today’s values” and agreed that “statues of people who were once celebrated should be allowed to stand.” Whatever your own personal views on these issues, those figures will likely come as a surprise to most. The numbers suggest that removing the statues is a contested call at best, a marginal one at worst. But when the mainstream media report on this, there seems to be an over-amplification of the side keen to see the status quo changed. If a statue is covered in paint, defaced, damaged or pulled down – then it s pushed for all to see. The other side, who are keen to see it remain, don’t seem to get the same traction. Unless it’s the widely despised football yobs ‘protecting’ the statues, whose behavior in many cases is an own goal for the keepers’ cause. NoChange.Org doesn’t appear to be that kind of activism. They launched their campaign by placing floral tributes spelling out ‘Hero’ next to Winston Churchill, Captain Cook and Clive of India – but they were either unnoticed or ignored. Happy to see the#herostatuestributes to Cook and Clive still in place (and Churchill s). Sadly, Nelson s has been removed.pic.twitter.com/aLA4R0LZpQ This is not about making excuses for racism or allowing hate speech to flourish. The debate is, why are the petitions calling for removal of statues seemingly given a higher priority by politicians and state leaders? And will this type of response be afforded to the petitions calling for them to remain? So far, almost 3,000 havesignedto keep Cecil Rhodes in place at Oxford University and 10,000 arebackingthe McDonough Confederate Soldier Statue in Georgia. The volume control is what needs modifying. Some of us may not agree with what other members of society think or say, but tolerance is the mark of civilised societies. It appears as if NoChange, who describe themselves as “a global community dedicated to resisting threats to our heritage,” feel they are being overrun and pounded into submission. Petitions have no binding power to enforce anything. So it speaks to the frustration of the pro-keepers, who feel they have to fight fire with fire. What happens from hereon in to all of these controversial statutes is far from clear, and will likely differ depending on local concerns. But governments need to take the bull by the horns and deal with this in an open and transparent fashion, so the debates and rankles don’t keep simmering away – decisions have to be made. But what is clear is that we need to listen and make sure all peaceful and respectful opinions are considered on an equal basis. The rampant proliferation of petitions suggests this isn’t happening.

"24 Jul, 2020","Federal forces ‘on standby’ to enter Seattle, if protests turn violent & local cops need support","A tactical unit of federal agents has been placed on standby in Seattle to aid police should protests there spiral into unrest or rioting, the New York Times reported, a move that comes amid heated objections from local officials. A Special Response Team operating under the authority of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was reportedly dispatched to Seattle on Thursday, as a precautionary measure. “The CBP team will be on standby in the area, should they be required,”the Federal Protective Service said in a statement about the operation. An agency spokesman who declined to be named, told the NYT that the border agents were sent to back up other law enforcement in protecting federal buildings, but would only be called into the streets if protests escalate to unrest. The decision mirrors similar efforts in Portland, where federal agents have squared off with protesters in recent days, amid weeks of heated demonstrations there that have frequently seen violent clashes between activists and law enforcement. Earlier on Thursday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee insisted no federal agents would be used in the city, stressing that he did not want to see a repeat of Portland – where reports of unmarked officers snatching protesters off the street have evoked sharp public outcry and clashes with the feds. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has voiced similar opposition to the use of federal law enforcers, however it isn’t clear if they will be able to prevent the deployment, as Oregon officials have taken up similar objections to no avail. The federal units are part of a Department of Homeland Security task force created by US President Donald Trump in June. In an executive order, Trump mandated the protection of federal property and monuments – which have become frequent targets for anti-racism and police brutality protesters across the US – seeing officers from a slew of federal agencies deployed in various cities to back up local police departments. Though most of those operations have been short-lived – some lasting only through the July 4 weekend, for example – Portland has seen a much longer deployment, as agents remain there to defend a government property besieged by protesters, including a federal courthouse. Seattle has seen a wave of demonstrations since the death of George Floyd in a botched arrest attempt in late May, with protesters taking over the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood for several weeks earlier this summer after police abandoned the area. While city officials initially put up little resistance to the occupied zone – known as CHOP for short – the cop-free encampment was dismantled after some five separate shooting incidents and several deaths.

"23 Jul, 2020","‘White Fragility’ is an exhausting, dull, racially obsessed book that only serves to deepen divisions","Robin DiAngelo’s bestseller just proves that the woke intersectional left is equally unhealthily obsessed with race as the alt-right white nationalists they claim to despise. Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall Guy Birchall, British journalist covering current affairs, politics and free speech issues. Recently published in The Sun and Spiked Online. Follow him on Twitter@guybirchall ‘White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism’ has recently ensconced itself in the global zeitgeist. Despite being written in 2018, its popularity has soared this year in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and global blacklivesmatter protests-cum-riots. It is currently on both the New York Times and Amazon bestseller lists, no doubt making its author, Robin DiAngelo, a very wealthy woman. I didn’t want to read this book; Scandinavian detective novels are more my bag to be honest, but given the prominence of it, I thought it best to see what all the fuss was about. Thus I subjected myself to thisexhausting, boring read, so you don’t have to put yourself through it – or further line the pockets of Professor DiAngelo. The book’s argument is simple: if you are white, you are a racist. There is no way out of this fact as DiAngelo says that white people denying they are racist is simply further proof that they are racist. This, she argues, is the eponymous ‘white fragility’ which is a product of white people growing up in a society which is steeped in ‘white supremacy’. You may well have thought that white supremacy was confined to meetings of skinheads with swastika tattoos and rallies full of hooded lunatics setting fire to crosses. However, DiAngelo argues that Western society is built on white supremacy and as a result it pervades everything. Again, denying that our society is inherently racist only serves to compound and protect that white supremacy on which it is built. Even if people of colour gain positions of power in society, such as Barack Obama, Colin Powell, or Clarence Thomas, this does nothing to make the system less racist as they“support the status quo.”DiAngelo’s claims are completely unfalsifiable and effectively make racism in the West something akin to ‘The Force’ in Star Wars. Perplexingly, along with being unfalsifiable, they are also contradictory. For example, DiAngelo argues that white people don’t see themselves in racial terms, while simultaneously arguing that their actions preserve “white solidarity.” How can a group that doesn’t see themselves as a group express solidarity? It is also argued that white people should both not avoid talking about race and not expect black people to “educate” them about it. This again makes no sense. However, while white people can never not be racist – DiAngelo herself says she is still racist – they can do “work” to make themselves more aware. Coincidentally, this “work” happens to be DiAngelo, who along with being a professor in “multicultural education” specialising in “whiteness studies” is also a diversity “facilitator.” This means thatfor a fee of between $30,000-$40,000she will lecture you for around 90 minutes, at the end of which, if you listen very closely, you will still be racist, but more aware of it. That doesn’t exactly seem like money well spent. The purpose of these lectures is not only to make whites aware that they are inherently racist, but also to build up their “racial stamina.” You see, racial stamina is the way to combat white fragility and, from the sounds of it, building up this stamina is a deeply unpleasant process. The book is littered with anecdotes from these lectures and seminars, all of which appear to end with someone either in tears or storming out in a rage. Although this is obviously no indication of the lectures themselves being bad or insulting, just indicative of white fragility. The crying is a particular problem for Professor DiAngelo, particularly white women crying in front of black people. Indeed, she considers this so much of a problem that there is an entire chapter of the book titled ‘White Women’s Tears’. Her reasoning behind this is that there is a history of black men being tortured and murdered because of white women’s distress. As a white woman herself, she writes,“our tears trigger the terrorism of this history,”before citing the case of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after allegedly flirting with a white woman. This example is a perfect illustration of how DiAngelo’s warped view of the world manages to simultaneously be insulting to both white and black people. She argues not only that black men will immediately think of lynching when they see a white woman cry, but also that if they comfort the woman they are doing so not out of sympathy or concern, but because they have been conditioned by sexism and the patriarchy. Her argument constantly seems to rob people of colour of their own agency, while impugning the motive of racism into any action by a white person. If a white person is nice to a black person, it is racist. If they are nasty to a black person, that is also racist. Saying that you were taught to treat everyone equally is not only racist but also ignorant as it shows you are unaware of your socialised racism. To illustrate this socialised racism, the book is peppered with anecdotes designed to show that all white people are racist, but really just display DiAngelo’s own prejudices. She argues that white people come away from the story of Jackie Robinson believing he was the first black baseball player good enough to play with whites rather than the first who was allowed to. But no one with even a passing interest in the sport believes that he was simply the first black man capable of competing with whites, making her argument a total fallacy. Elsewhere she says that white people use coded language such as “sketchy,” “urban,” or “bad neighbourhood” when what they really mean is a lot of black people live there. To demonstrate this, DiAngelo writes about a conversation she was having with a white friend who was telling her about a white couple she knew that had moved to New Orleans for $25,000. Her friend then told her that the couple had also bought a gun, at which point DiAngelo says, “I immediately knew they had bought a home in a black neighbourhood.” DiAngelo will presumably assert that all white people would make that assumption, but she cannot be sure of that. This statement is indicative her own prejudices, not a universal one. DiAngelo’s argument is a perfect circular one, you are racist because you are white, only white people can be racist, so being racist makes you white. It is then impossible to argue against because denial is simply further proof of your racism. You can’t even argue that you just treat people as individuals because that ignores their experience as a member of a group in an inescapable intersectional power structure. Ironically, she shares the exact same view of race as the white nationalists she presumably despises. The best example of the unfalsifiability of her argument comes when DiAngelo lists a series of phrases used by white people to claim they are not racist. This includes phrases like: “I know people of colour,” “I marched in the sixties,” “the real oppression is class,” “you don’t know me,” but the most telling one of all is, “I disagree.” In Robin DiAngelo’s view, disagreeing with her is just proof that you are a racist. There is no room for nuance or debate, no shades of grey – to Professor DiAngelo the world is, in every sense of the phrase, black and white.

Employees of Channel One Russia were injured in the attack by“camouflaged men”in the US city of Portland, Oregon, where protests have continued since the death of George Floyd in late May. Floyd, a black father of five, was choked to death by a white police officer in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the world. “We view as outrageous the attack on Russian journalists by police of the United States,”Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said, according to TASS.

The city’s council bosses have labeled the vandalism“utterly sickening”and are sifting through CCTV footage in an effort to find the perpetrators. Vandals are thought to have daubed the mural in Manchester’s ‘Northern Quarter’ district with a racist term sometime between Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. Akse – a Manchester street artist – created the mural in Stevenson Square, amid protests and demonstrations around the world sparked by the brutal death of Floyd in US police custody in May. The offensive word was removed from the mural and the artwork was partly boarded up on Wednesday morning until repairs can commence.

Dr. Errol Francis, CEO and artistic director of arts charity ‘Culture&’, who has called for British museums and galleries to support the decolonization of their collections and reword racially sensitive artwork titles, has hit out at their recent public statements in support of BLM. Francis accused the UK cultural institutions of hypocrisy for appearing to show support for oppressed black people on the one hand, while on the other still possessing items taken by force from African nations, such as the Benin Bronzes that were looted by the British in the late 19th century. The arts charity boss also believes that colonial art held in museums and art galleries in the UK should be seen in the same way as artefacts seized by the Nazis illegally, telling the Guardian that they“should be returned.” The museums themselves have this relationship with colonial violence. So when they made these statements about supporting blacklivesmatter , I think it actually drew attention to their own complicity in similar acts. The British Museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, wrote ablog postlast month saying that the museum stands in solidarity with“the British Black community, with the African American community, with the Black community throughout the world.” Several other high-profile galleries and museums responded to the blacklivesmatter movement – which was sparked into renewed action following the murder of unarmed black man George Floyd in the US – with public statements of support.

The 17-foot (5m) mural in downtown Redwood City was scrubbed in order to avoid“driver confusion and traffic accidents,”city spokesperson Jennifer Yamaguma told local media, adding that the authorities will no longer permit“art”installations to appear on the streets. The mural was painted earlier this month by a local resident named Dan Pease. Local media reported that the city had not only authorized Pease’s project but supplied him with yellow poster board paint. The man told KPIX-TV that he expected the mural to last“as long as the paint lasted.” Want to get rid of the BLM graffiti on the city streets? Apparently this is the best/fastest way to do it.https://t.co/OrCaybpQL7 City officials appear to have suddenly changed their attitude after another person, Maria Rutenburg, applied for a permit to paint a ‘MAGA 2020’ mural.“I saw ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ sign appearing on Broadway Street on the asphalt and I figured that’s gonna be a new public space, open for discussion, and I wanted to get my message out, too,”she told local media. Rutenburg’s request was ultimately denied, and the city did not link her application to the swift removal of the BLM mural. However, many on social media are now blaming the woman and her idea for a pro-Trump mural for the removal. A petition was launched online, which alleges that the city destroyed the sign because of“a single complaint by a white woman.”The petition went on to state that“such negation of the community’s voice is itself an example of white supremacy – privileging one white voice over the community’s.” Numerous BLM murals were painted on the streets of US cities in the wake of massive protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May.

Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf appeared on a Fox News segment on Tuesday night, discussing the ongoing protests and rioting across Portland, which he says have continued for“52 nights in a row”as federal officers there are stretched to the limit. “Because we don’t have that local law enforcement support, we are having to go out and proactively arrest individuals, and we need to do that because we need to hold them accountable,”Wolf told Fox’s Martha MacCallum. This idea that [protesters] can attack federal property and law enforcement officers and go to the other side of the street and say ‘you can’t touch me’ is ridiculous. We don’t do that in any other type of law enforcement. The comments soon inspired countless comparisons to Minority Report, Philip K. Dick’s 1956 classic in which a technologically advanced police division sniffs out“pre-crime,”locking up hapless suspects before they commit any offense. The Trump admin has now reached the Minority Report phase of this dystopian nightmare. The only thing that s missing is the precogs.https://t.co/6AToO55rhi In other words, they re arresting people who haven t actually done anything wrong.

Proactive arresting? Just say it: Arresting people who have not committed an act that warrants arrest. You know—innocent, peaceful people. The DHS says the protests have not remained peaceful, insisting it has been“forced”to make arrests to keep agents safe, with Wolf repeatedly citing lack of support from local police. “What is occurring in Portland in the early hours of every morning is not peaceful protesting,”Wolf said at a Tuesday press briefing, adding“If you are a violent rioter looking to inflict damage to federal property or law enforcement officers, you need to find another line of work.” We will not retreat. We will continue to protect our facilities and our law enforcement officers. A growing number of federal agents have been deployed to Portland in recent weeks as protests rage on in the city – kicked off in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody in May. Under an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump in late June, a federal task force was created to protect historical monuments and other federal property from vandalism, which have become a frequent target for activists. Since the deployment began, reports have emerged from the city that unmarked agents aresnatching demonstratorsoff the streets, some seemingly at random, however the DHS insists its tactics are legal.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC The riots that came after the death of George Floyd were unprecedented. Several big cities went ablaze and even smaller ones, such as my own, saw looting and break-ins. Many of these instances were escalated by the Marxist group known as Antifa, which stands for Anti-Fascist Action. As detailed in Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, they are a loosely organized group that are by their nature militant. They believe in“proactive self-defense”against fascism. Granted they define fascism as anything that isn’t Anarcho-Communism and“proactive self-defense”is just a fancier way of saying“attack whoever isn’t us.” Around the 18th of this month, the Department of Homeland Security here in America deployed an elite unit to Portland. This group, known as the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (or BORTAC for short) was brought in after President Trump signed an executive order to protect American monuments, memorials, statues, and federal property. However, the purpose of this unit is much less complicated than that. It’s part of a larger effort to bring an end to the constant rioting and property damage that these Marxists have caused. Now, this was an inevitability, once Trump signed that executive order, that some group would be moving in, but the DHS handles terrorism. On top of this, Attorney General William Barr has stated that he’s already investigating members of Antifa. But why exactly have we reached this point where the Fed has to get involved? It’s simple. The mayors of the biggest cities in the United States have been completely complacent about these crises. Any mayor with a spine would have let their police force take care of the riots, and make sure that the people disperse. They didn’t. In Minneapolis, a police department was completely overrun and nothing happened. Portland had over forty days of constant rioting. There is still property destruction going on. There’s so much that could be done by the police, or even the national guard, but nothing ever is. This is because the mayors of these cities are coddling people who want to set everything on fire. I believe in Federalism. It is a good way to run a government. However, part of the reason that we have Federal law enforcement in the first place is to handle incredibly complex cases or to handle domestic terror cases. At the same time, Antifa isn’t exactly the Weathermen. Similar philosophies, but the methods of destruction are different. There shouldn’t need to be a federal presence at all. Local law enforcement, SWAT and riot police should be able to handle these issues. If not, the National Guard would be able to handle this. They have the tools at their disposal. The only reason this could have come to this is inaction. The duty of the Government in the United States is to defend the inalienable rights of the citizen. Life, liberty, and property as outlined in our Constitution. Rioting by its nature encourages all of those to be violated. If the local government won’t do enough or isn’t enough, the state comes next. If the state doesn’t do it, the Federal has to. As such, each of these cities has basically invited Trump to take care of it how he chooses. Beyond that, many people may remember this during the election. In essence, the Leftists in our current government while trying to“resist”Donald Trump may as well have invited him to personally solve their problems, all while the nation sees him as a hero.

One month after changing its style guide to require capitalization of the word“black”when referring to black people, the Associated Press wire service said it won’t do the same for the word“white.” “White people in general have much less shared history and culture, and don’t have the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color,”the APsaidon Monday, in an article about its decision. The company said anti-racism protests following the killing of George Floyd on May 31 had prompted it and many other news organizations to re-examine their practices. There is, at this time, less support for capitalizing white. White people generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color. (5/8) AP rules are highly influential in setting standards for word choices, punctuation, and other style points, because most English-language news outlets use the guide as their own or as a default position when their own policies don’t cover a topic. The book is also a required reference for many journalism students. The wire service acknowledged that its decision over“white”was“more ticklish”than its June 19 ruling on“Black.” “We agree that white people’s skin color plays into systemic inequalities and injustices, and we want our journalism to robustly explore these problems,”John Daniszewski, AP’s vice president and editor-at-large for standards, said in a memo to staff on Monday. Capitalizing the term ‘white,’ as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs. AP decision-makers apparently didn’t consider the possibility of people of other skin colors giving themselves special deference out of racist beliefs. The decision brought a mixed reaction, with some Twitter users calling it racist and others cheering the move. “Wow, that’s not racist at all, except for the racist part,”said one, while another said,“The alt-left mob is inside your house.”A supporter tweeted,“It makes perfect sense. I’m honestly sorry that you either don’t understand it or don’t want to understand it, but it absolutely makes sense.” That s racist.Treating one race of people differently than another.Definitely violated federal EEOC laws It’s not treating anyone different, my love. It’s simply changing a letter, to celebrate a culture that was repressed in history. It’s not treating someone differently because this change literally does not impact you life The day the@APStylebookjumped the shark. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Many news organizations had already made rulings of their own on the issue, with the New York Times, NBC News, and others saying they would capitalize“Black”but not“white”– and Fox News and CNN saying they would capitalize“White”and“Black”along with other ethnic group names. CBS News said it would capitalize“White,”except when referring to white supremacists, white nationalists or white privilege. Sorry,@APStylebook, but you dithered too long. Most newsrooms probably have their own style by now. For us, it’s Black and White. When the AP revised its style guidelines in June, it ruled that both“Black,”and“Indigenous”would be capitalized, along with other ethnic identifiers, such as Latino. The company said at the time that it was still deliberating on treatment of the word“white.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/495335-ap-style-not-capitalizing-white/
"20 Jul, 2020","Grab a shovel, America! This election season the fake news, hoaxes and tell-all books are flowing fast down the pipe","Amid an epic political battle for the White House, Americans can no longer believe what they read and hear in the media. This is a dangerous reality for the nation, which needs accurate information to meet a flurry of challenges. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Every four years, the US mainstream media should be required to carry a surgeon general’s warning on its TV and print publications that states: ‘Consuming mainstream media in an election year may critically impair a voter’s ability to make rational decisions due to skewed information. Use at your own discretion.’ Anyone who doubts that statement may wish to consider the impressivehatchetjob that CNN’s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta performed last week when quoting White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. In an effort to explain that the Trump administration was in favor of opening schools amid the Covid crisis, McEnany told a press conference:“The science should not stand in the way of this… the science is very clear on this... We encourage... localities and states to just simply follow the science. Open our schools.” Despite the straightforwardness of the message, Acosta tweeted out to his 1.7 million followers just 10 words from McEnany’s monologue, the part where she said:“The science should not stand in the way of this.”That deliberate distortion prompted thousands of misinformed people to accuse the Trump administration of practically being neo-luddites and ‘anti-science.’ Was Acosta’s shoddy reporting just an oversight, or could it be chalked up as a politically motivated hit job against the Republicans with presidential elections just over 100 days away? Considering the mainstream media’s well-known history of negative reporting on Donald Trump, it is very tempting to go with the latter explanation. pretty dishonest journalism here. CNN’s acosta cuts off the quote, doesn’t give full context, and goes viral.

Thus far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Amid fears that the number of Covid cases is being padded, possibly due to the political incentive, it was revealed that a 20-year-old Florida man who died in a motorcycle crash was listed as a Covid-related death. How many other deathsarebeing wrongly dropped into the Covidcategoryis anyone’s guess, but many high-ranking officialsbelievethere are serious problems with the tallying of numbers. It’s this sort of willingness to jump to unreasonable conclusions over a highly sensitive issue that may have led NASCAR race driver Bubba Wallace to confuse a garage door opener for an actual noose, thereby inflaming racial tensions at the worst possible time. Was there any sort of political motivation behind the claim, which has been debunked by an FBIinvestigation, that a ‘hate crime’ had been committed? That is hard to say, but it cannot be ignored that the incident – coming at the very same time America’s streets were being overrun by blacklivesmatter protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death – sparked a war of words on Twitter between the African-American NASCAR driver and Donald Trump. Has@BubbaWallaceapologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER! Meanwhile, amid the ongoing hysteria over Covid and race relations, Russiagate may seem like ancient history, yet that didn’t prevent it from floating to the surface again last week. It happened as Attorney General William Barrdeclassifiedtwo documents that proved beyond reasonable doubt the FBI was aware of some dozen inaccuracies in a 2017 New York Timesreport, the most devastating being that Trump officials were having contacts with Russian intelligence officers. The discovery presented a nice opportunity for America’s purported ‘paper of historical record’ to set the record straight with regards to the political witch hunt, prompted by unfounded accusations in the so-called ‘Steele Dossier,’ which hounded the Trump administration for four long years. Yet the New York Times has chosen to cling to its story, refusing to provide either an apology or a retraction to its readers. “We stand by our reporting,”saidEileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman. And then there were, of course, the books – tell-all screeds from confidants and even family members close to Donald Trump – with their tantalizing tidbits of information that the media promised would sink the US president’s political career once and for all. Former US national security adviser John Bolton, for example, who Trump dismissed in September 2019, released ‘The Room Where It Happened’ in June. As regularly occurs in Washington DC, which has arguably the worst plumbing in the world, a copy of the manuscript wasleakedonline in January, at the very same time – surprise, surprise – Trump was facing an impeachment inquiry. Despite the heated anticipation over the prospect that the book’s revelations would help drive Trump from office, the fanfare trickled out when even Bolton himselfadmittedhe had no ‘silver bullet,’ as it were, to help the Democrats’ cause. Another election-year blast, entitled ‘Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World s Most Dangerous Man,’ was released by none other than Trump’s niece. Where Bolton hoped to demolish his former boss with a cheap he-said, she-said expose from inside of the White House, Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, hoped to accomplish the same by detailing aspects of Trump’s family life. At one point in the book, Mary Trump revealed how her father’s family had been left out of her grandfather’s will, with the bulk of the family fortune passing to the favored Donald. After that revelation, she writes:“Donald, following the lead of my grandfather and with the complicity, silence and inaction of his siblings, destroyed my father. I can’t let him destroy my country.” Could Mary Trump’s book be dismissed as a case of sour grapes, or even ‘fake news’ by a disgruntled Trump family member? It seems entirely possible. That is precisely the problem with such tell-all memoirs; the veracity of the claims is difficult to prove since they rely on the hazy recollections – not to mention the personal prejudices – of the storyteller. In any case, both books, which have gone on to sell millions of copies, provide fodder against the US president in the most hotly contested US presidential election in many years. This leads us to the question: what can the American voter truly believe this election year? The answer seems to be ‘absolutely nothing.’ From fudged reports emerging from White House press briefings, to the muddled memories of former Trump confidantes and relatives, it seems that everything is tainted in some way by political intrigue. As happens every four years, truth has fled the American house. The difference this time around, however, is that an ominous cloud of violence, unrest and upheaval hangs over these elections like never before. Therefore, with every fake news story that gets circulated, the chances that the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election will turn ugly only increases. After all, people are not stupid, and they are very good at understanding when they are being fooled. Yet the only thing Americans can put their faith in these days is that the uncertainty will only continue, straight up to November 3. What the morning of November 4 will look like in America is anybody’s guess, but I doubt fake news will be able to conceal it. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/495314-us-election-fake-news/

"19 Jul, 2020",‘Do we name Fort Bragg after Rev Al Sharpton?’ Trump says he may veto renaming of military bases honoring Confederate generals,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act over the proposed purge of military base names that honor Confederate figures, telling Fox News, “Yeah, I might.” Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Trump told anchor Chris Wallace that renaming bases wouldn’t go down well.“Go to the community, say, ‘How do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name it?’ And ‘We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton’?”he said, referring to the black civil rights activist and minister. Renaming Confederate-honoring military installations is part of the provisions and recommendations contained in Congress’s annual defense authorization bill, the NDAA. It was included in response to the blacklivesmatter protests that erupted across the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill! Trump threatened to veto the $740 billion defense bill over the renaming of military bases earlier in July. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters in June that he wouldn’t sign any legislation that included any mention of renaming bases,sayingthe idea was a“non-starter”for the president. Calls to remove Confederate statues and the Confederate flag have intensified in the past few months. Many consider them to be offensive because Confederate fighters in the 1861 US civil war were fighting to uphold slavery. Trump and others see it as a free speech issue, as the flag is part of the culture of southern US states. Trump told Wallace that the Confederate flag was not a race issue, as“when people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag – it represents the South.” We can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. WATCH: President Trump on violence in our cities, the battle over police funding, and ""cancel culture.""

Anthony Brown (D-Md) and Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb).

"18 Jul, 2020",‘White penises jeopardize your melanin’: Boston BLM leader and Democrat organizer unleashes RACE MIXING tirade against opponent,"A video of BLM campaigner Monica Cannon-Grant, who’s been honored by Democrats in Boston, shows her unleashing a racist rant against a black Republican politician, telling her to shut up because she “rides white penises.” Cannon-Grant’s work on the blacklivesmatter cause has seen her honored by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, and even former presidential candidateElizabeth Warren. She’s been lauded as a“hero among us”by the Boston Celtics. She writes for the Boston Globe, and is currently working to re-elect Rep. Ayanna Pressley and District Attorney Rachael Rollins, both progressive Democrats. A recent outburst of hers, however, would be unprintable on the Globe’s pages. This absolutely disgusting.

The full video is in the article:#Mapolihttps://t.co/HoAkymHQvepic.twitter.com/bpMXPDiCff In a video that surfaced late on Friday, Cannon-Grant accused Pressley’s opponent – Republican Rayla Campbell – of selling out her race by marrying a white man. “If white vagina and white penises jeopardize your melanin, then we need you to sit in the back of the classroom,”she ranted.“You don’t get to talk right now. “Regardless of many educated gang symbols you have at the end of your name, regardless of how close in proximity you are to white supremacy, regardless of how many white penises you ride,”she said to Campbell,“just don’t forget, that you’s a ni**a.” Here s Congressman Joe Kennedy, complimenting his openly racist friend Monica Cannon-Grant for her leadership and fierce advocacy.

I need you to shut the f**k up,”said the activist, who’s been described by the Globe as a“force to be reckoned with in Boston.” While Cannon-Grant’s rhetoric wouldn’t sound out of place in the segregationist south of the 1950s, it is typical of a certain strand of militant anti-white thought that’s entered the mainstream since the killing of George Floyd and subsequent nationwide riots. Author Robin Di Angelo’s ‘White Fragility’ – which accuses white people of racism whether they act racist or not – sits atop the New York Times’ bestsellers list.

"18 Jul, 2020", I wasn’t trying to make a political statement : NBA star James Harden calls for calm amid Blue Lives Matter mask debate,"Houston Rockets star James Harden has denied he was making a political statement after he received criticism online for being pictured wearing a face covering which appeared to endorse the pro-police Blue Live Matter movement. Harden sported a mask featuring an American flag along with a thin blue line, iconography which has come to be known as support for the Blue Lives Matter campaign - a group some cite as being contrary to the wave of blacklivesmatter protests currently prevalent in the United States. The images were released by both the Rockets and the NBA Twitter accounts, and were immediately greeted with derision from sections of fans who accused the NBA great of being ignorant to the racial debate which has raged since the death of George Floyd in late May. The mask also featured a Punisher logo, a symbol which has been appropriated by some far-right groups. Mask Up📸@NBApic.twitter.com/PFsIuJybYb The Masked Beard!#WholeNewGamepic.twitter.com/DJrp23M5TL However, Harden has since released a statement to add further context to the photographs and says that they were intended as a fashion statement rather than a political one. ""Honestly I wasn’t trying to make a political statement,"" he told reporters Friday. ""Honestly I wore it just because it covered my whole face and my beard."" Several figures within global sport - and particularly within the NBA - have shown vocal support for the blacklivesmatter movement, which added to the surprise of Harden s apparent objection to it. But Harden says that his support for the protests is total. ""It’s pretty simple. As I talked about [Thursday], me finding a way to, whether it’s with my jersey name or another way to show my support for blacklivesmatter ,"" he said. ""So that’s pretty simple.

"18 Jul, 2020",Leader of radical black-only militia NFAC ‘believes in violence’ & wants a real-life Wakanda for every black person in America,"NFAC, the masked, armed black militia that recently marched through a park in Georgia, deems violence and killing an acceptable response to oppression. Their end goal is to break away from the US as their own black-only nation. ByChris Sweeney, author who has written for various UK magazines and newspapers, including The Times, The Sun and The Daily Record. Follow him on Twitter@Writes_Sweeney The NFAC (Not F*cking Around Coalition) grabbed plenty of attention on social media with a high-profile public debut on July 4. The sight of an all-black militia, clutching rifles and handguns, marching in the heartland of the Ku Klux Klan at Stone Mountain caused plenty of ripples. But very little is known about them, despite a frenzy of speculation. It’s not even clear when they were created or how many of them there are. So to make their intentions clear, NFAC founder and leader Grand Master Jay (real name John Fitzgerald Johnson) spoke exclusively to RT. There’s a misconception that we’re a terrorist group and want to kill white people. “We are here to protect the black community, as that’s who is under attack. Nobody is protecting black children, men and women in America. What necessitated the creation of NFAC was the need to address a rising tide of police brutality, of racial brutality, of unfairness in the judicial system,”he said. “Most of us like me are ex-miliitary, we’re not young people on the block, we’re voters, we’re your responsible guys, we’re the guys with the good jobs.” While seeing themselves as protectors, Jay has a clear aim of what he wants to achieve – and he’s not playing it small. He feels that black people need to be split from the rest of the US. So he says he, and others, are filing an order of liberation with the International Court of Justice. He explained:“I want them to declare every black person who is a descendent of the Portuguese slave trade a political prisoner of the United States. And to sanction the United States to do one of two things. The first is give us our own land here, so we can go in, set up our own government and the whole nine yards.” Some have speculated that Jay is demanding the states of Texas as this land, but he only used the Lone Star state as an example. The key is to be given land no longer controlled by the White House. The other option is more radical, which most media have refused to publish. Jay revealed:“It s a glaring fact that mainstream media in the United States has completely ignored the NFAC. ABC News tried to do an interview with me but found the information too scary, so they buried the story as a history piece about Stone Mountain.” The mainstream media will not report on us, as images of organized black folks with guns would send shivers down the spine of the racist core of America. “My other aim is for an exodus to Africa, to establish our destiny and build our own nation –  and get a seat at the UN like everybody else. Forty-five million of us is a nation within a nation, so we can take ourselves to a place where two countries friendly to us are willing to carve out some land. That would be in Africa, as it s where we come from, where we have greater numbers, where resources are and I already have relationships with some of the rulers of those countries. Hypothetically, I want to get an area of about  100 miles on each side, declare it a sovereign zone and build an infrastructure.” The exodus would only include black people. The NFAC only allow black members, and Jay doesn’t feel this should be a shocking admission. “Every other entity has their own, we’re the only people on the planet who don’t,”he said. “If something happens to a Chinese person in America, China gets upset. If it’s British person, the Queen has something to say about it. The color black is not a country, so if something happens to a black person in America, nobody gets upset.” The riots that broke out after the latest resonant police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, is apparently not what he has in mind. He wants to take things global. “We have no identity, they call us African Americans but tell me, where in Africa? There are 55 countries in Africa.” If we have our own country, then if something happens in America, we can go to the UN and say ‘that’s a violation.’ Those with a single black parent could be included but would be investigated by the NFAC along with their“pattern of behaviour.” NFAC hasn’t been spawned by the blacklivesmatter movement. Jay was part of BLM several years ago but grew frustrated by their direction. He feels a more authoritarian approach is the only way forward. “ blacklivesmatter does not represent the sentiments of the black community.We have distanced ourselves from them completely,”Jay admitted. “BLM doesn’t believe in violence, we do. We chose America’s Independence Day to send that message as we were slaves when that happened, we were not members of this country. We tried to be here for 247 years, we had reconstruction and they burned our towns down, we had Jim Crow when they set dogs on us and told us we couldn’t sit next to them –  we tried that with affirmative action and they rolled that back. It s obvious they don’t want us here.” NFAC s willingness to kill could be why they are shunned by the more mainstream activists. But Jay feels justified as he claims there have been 457 controversial killings since the 2014 police shooting of 18-year-old black man Michael Brown. “If anybody in our group has a personal agenda and just wants to shoot some people, then we’re not the group for them,”he says, before calmly explaining the rules of engagement: But on July 4 before we went to the park my orders were, kill them – not shoot or wound them, kill them. “That was the safety briefing. I told them we were not to initiate anything but if they attack us, then everyone out here will kill everyone in sight. We don t want to hear your excuses anymore, we don’t want to hear let’s talk or wait for the grand jury.” Along with the Stone Mountain march, the NFAC held a simultaneous event in Phoenix’s Escobar Park. Since then, Jay claims he’s been flooded by contacts globally and now has NFAC chapters internationally. However, members’ identities will remain anonymous. “There s a vetting process, we inspect them and then they get sworn into the NFAC,”he said. “We are also a coalition so some existing organizations want to be a part of us too, so we vet their members too. ""We learned our lessons from types of infiltration methodologies.That’s why we’re so secretive about our numbers, that’s why you cannot find out where we train, that’s why we are not as open to giving up the details.” The only name or face that is known is mine. I speak, no one else does. Back in 2016, Jayran for presidentbut felt his campaign was purposely sidelined. He regards 2020 contender Kanye as“a political joke”but did reveal some have urged him to run again. “Since Kanye’s announcement, I’ve received phone calls saying ‘you do know if you run for the presidency right now, you would win hands down,’”Jay said. “But my mission is not to save America, I tried that and I found out that big money and the media can be bought to block out good candidates. I will not go down that road again. “My goal is much loftier than that, not only to facilitate the exodus of the black nation here in America but the implementation of what we would call the United State of Africa.” Since July 4, Jay feels the NFAC had already made a clear difference. Things in his view have calmed down.“They got the message, there hasn’t been one lynching or police involved shooting since and a wave of unity has swept the black community and we’re seeing the judicial system trying to prosecute the cases.” While the NFAC is only for blacks, he does encourage other races to support their cause. Malcolm X said it best, you can help us, but you can’t join us. “Unless we are by ourselves and until we learn to love ourselves, we can’t love another people. When a people are denied knowledge of their culture and history of self, they have nothing to be proud of. “Did you see how proud they felt when they saw the movie ‘Black Panther’ which is make believe? Black people are yearning to belong to something, we have got to give them something to belong to. I would rather give my life for something noble like the liberation of my people, rather than to waste it staying alive being a weakling.” “And what you’ll find is, I’m not alone.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/495109-nfac-black-militia-blm/
"18 Jul, 2020","As lockdown loosens, more black men are stabbed in London. But blacklivesmatter has nothing to say","Despite a huge public profile and ongoing media attention, BLM fails to identify a role for itself in combating the appalling number of deaths of young black males in London from incidents of knife crime. What’s its purpose then? As pandemic lockdown restrictions were eased in London, it was very much business as usual – including the deaths by stabbing of three young black men in the English capital in the past week alone. The loss of black sons, brothers, fathers and husbands continues unabated, pausing momentarily while society was in lockdown, then grimly resuming once we were all free to leave our homes. In the case of talented MMA fighter Jahreau Shepherd, 30, he wasknifed to deathat his own birthday party. Cruelty has no respect. What is puzzling is that there seems to be no public outrage from those quarters who can generally be relied on to raise all hell over issues that seem so closely related to the colour of a person’s skin. For instance, where is blacklivesmatter on this issue? Why the silence? It was all over the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city nearly 4,000 miles away on another continent. But closer to home, following the deaths of Mr Shepherd, of 18-year-oldAhmed Yasin-Aliand ofDonnell Rhule, also 18, in three separate attacks in the past week alone, the silence of BLM is deafening. Which is strange. Because you would think that this outrageous resumption of seemingly endless knife crime on black people that has blighted London and elsewhere for years would be something BLM could really get its teeth into. In fact, it would be welcome to help, because no one else seems to have got to grips with it. The organisation now has a profile it could only have imagined six months ago, and it has the ear of a public ready to burst into action. Just say the word! Well, here’s a big opportunity. We’re waiting. When we hear of the ‘knife crime epidemic’ we need to understand that, to the young black men of the nation’s capital, it is a killer right up there with Covid-19. Some saythe reason that there is no outrage is because the victims are black, and that because they are a minority, white people don’t make a fuss about it. It’s a typically ignorant social warrior’s claim that just doesn’t wash anymore. In widely diverse London, white British people have themselves actually been a minority for around 10 years now, and the voice of the capital speaks many languages. Lack of outrage is not the problem. It is the lack of ability to tackle a cause that grows unchecked within BAME communities – and yes, white communities as well – namely destructive, nihilistic gang culture. While it offers the promise of riches and social reinforcement to vulnerable young black males, not helped by communities riddled with economic deprivation, low school attendances and sub-par housing, this culture is one of death and misery. Gangs thrive on conflict, which leads to bravado, imagined slurs, machismo and over-the-top violence and reprisals. To a gang member, black lives don’t matter. No lives matter. The only thing that does is the approval of those he mistakenly believes are his peers. To change minds in this instance needs people on the inside, people who gang members can identify with, who they can trust and maybe follow out of this one-way lifestyle. The efforts to even begin tackling this have so far been pretty disappointing. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has thrown buckets of money at the prevention of knife crime, but it is quite obviously not working. The problem his efforts have faced this year is that many of the initiatives are school-based, and kids haven’t actually been in school for months and won’t return until September. You can’t teach lessons to empty classrooms. For an anarchic outfit like the UK branch of BLM, whichdeclaresit wants to rid society of capitalism, imperialism and institutions of the state – like the police – this would appear to be fertile ground for debate, for solutions and for a joined-up plan that might make a difference. Build a powerbase of strong young minds, confident, articulate young black people who can establish their place in society in a positive way, creating an exciting new future where no one can ever deny that yes, indeed, black lives do matter. But what was BLM in the UK up to this week? Well there was time to kick up a fuss with Bristol Council byerecting a hastily created statueof a 21st century BLM protestor defiantly raising her fist on the empty plinth previously occupied by 17th-century merchant Edward Colston. But on the deaths of three black men in London? Nothing. Nada. Niente. Let’s face it, the BLM movement in this country is all about encouraging people of colour to identify themselves as victims – not just today, but throughout history – and white people as the enemy to be shouted down. Okay, we all get that. Denying that racism and inequality have been a stain on white society for hundreds of years is just bonkers, and yes, reparations, reviews and recompense are required. But cancel culture and toppling statues don’t fix anything. They just make more noise around the race discussion that draws the lunatic fringes from both sides of the argument into a raucous, incomprehensible row that leads nowhere and helps absolutely nobody. It certainly did nothing for Jahreau Shepherd, Ahmed Yasin-Ali or Donnell Rhule. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/495116-blm-knife-crime-london-hypocrisy/
"17 Jul, 2020","No-fly zone: Pentagon effectively bans Confederate, LGBT and BLM flags from DoD property","The Pentagon has effectively banned the Confederate flag at US military sites around the world, without explicitly saying so, in a new policy unveiled on Friday. A Department of Defensememohas outlined the flags that are deemed acceptable to display in Department of Defense workplaces and common areas – and the Confederate flag is not among those listed. The LGBT pride flag and blacklivesmatter banners are also absent from the list of acceptable emblems. A draft version of the policy reportedly banned the Confederate symbol outright, accordingtoPolitico, but the published version just details the types of flags which may be displayed, such as those of US states, military services, and flags belonging to allied countries. The approved emblems“must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols,”Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in the memo. “The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges,”an unnamed defense official told Reuters. President Donald Trump views the Confederate flag issue as one of free speech, and criticized NASCAR’s decision to ban it in June. Following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May, calls to ban the flag and remove statues of Confederate figures intensified as protesters demanded action to tackle racism. The controversial flag was used in the Civil War in 1861-65 by Southern states which fought for the continuation of slavery. Today it is viewed by many Americans as offensive, because it is seen as an approval of slavery and a symbol of racism. Others say it is part of the South’s culture and a reminder of those who died in the war. The ban has exceptions, including displays in museums, on license places, grave sites and in art, where it is clear that the flag is not being endorsed by the DoD.

Aside from writing for RT, he hosts the podcast Micah and The Hatman, and is an independent comic book writer. Follow Micah at@MindofMicahC In a recent interview on The Talk, Terry Crews followed up his interview with Don Lemon, where he’d been critical of blacklivesmatter , by stating “we have to include this white voice, this Hispanic voice, this Asian voice. We have to include it right now because if we don’t, it’s going to slip into something we’re not prepared for.” ThenNick Cannoncame forward with his anti-white and anti-Jew statements. Crews seemed oddly prophetic, but he still came under fire for his statements. When I was young, I was never afraid of the KKK...It was people like you. The threats, the intimidation, discouraging free thought, and “the insult of acting white”.My heart breaks because your behavior only reveals you don’t know how powerful you are.https://t.co/vgJU9TCgmZ The thing about this is that Terry Crews is right, and what his critics don’t understand is that he understands history. When it came to both the abolition of slavery in America and the Civil Rights movement, it was white people who made the decisions to fix the problems. But by appealing to the Constitution, both Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr were able to make arguments that swayed people and gained them allies. In the modern day, if you want a problem solved, it can’t be one that concerns only one people group. Everyone needs to band together to solve it, because without that there will just be more conflict. The ideas coming from people like Nick Cannon, or his supporters likeCharlamagne tha God, orSean “Diddy” Combs, show an “us against them” attitude. People who agree with Terry Crews, like basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, are apparentlyJudas Iscariotto Ice Cube, who postedanti-Semitic images on Twitterfollowing the death of George Floyd. These ideas that portray either white people or Jews as “the other” are standard supremacist thought. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if it’s white supremacy or black supremacy or any other type of supremacy. That thought process always leads to heartache and violence. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the rise inanti-Semitic violencehas happened at all. The culprits of crimes have been both whites and blacks, with the whites involved often being white supremacists. Some of the most prominent shootings of the last two years were by white supremacists targeting synagogues. This shouldn’t really surprise anyone either. White supremacists have a history of encouraging this sort of thing, such as Vox Daycheering on Anders Brevijk, or many online white supremacists celebrating the death of Heather Heyer during the Unite the Right Rally. If black people go down this particular rabbit hole, they will end up becoming no better than the white supremacists that they hate so much. There will be violence, murders, and other such harm dished out to innocents. We’ve already seen these types of attacks in the aforementioned anti-Semitic attacks in New York, or thetorture of a special needs white personin Chicago. The latter was live streamed on Facebook for the world to see. Again, there will be more of this if people listen to Nick Cannon or Ice Cube over Terry Crews and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The fact of the matter is that the essence of supremacist ideology is envy and hatred, both motivators for violence. A particular group becomes “the other.” For a black supremacist, this “other” is white people and Jews. For a white supremacist, it’s usually Jews and anyone who isn’t white. When someone becomes “the other” in these groups the only conclusion that is reached is that they must be destroyed for the preservation of one’s own tribe. In this particular instance, young black men and women are being taught that these other groups are inherently evil, and must be attacked and eliminated. This leads to public beatings, kidnapping and torture, riots, and murder. Supremacists always want to destroy everything else to build themselves something on the ashes. But that’s not how America operates. We realize that there is something that is common in all of us across race, creed and other differences. And that is our shared humanity. Ultimately, problems aren’t solved by finding one group to put forth as a scapegoat. It’s about coming together and figuring out the problem together, something all humans are capable of. We just need to drop this supremacist nonsense and start acting like humans as opposed to monsters. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/495084-terry-crews-black-supremacy/

Bernard Kerik, who was police commissioner of New York under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said he heard Thursday that de Blasio has one sergeant and eight other officers assigned to guarding the Fifth Avenue mural during each of three daily shifts.“Violence, shootings, and murder is up in NYC and this clown has three sergeants and 24 cops guarding a mural!

"17 Jul, 2020",‘We’ve seen this happening all over the country’: Statue of Jesus BEHEADED inside Florida church in alleged hate crime,"A statue of Jesus has been left headless in the courtyard of a Catholic church in Kendale Lakes, Florida, after allegedly being vandalized. The Miami Archdiocese says it expects police to pursue the incident as a hate crime. The statue of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd had been resting behind the church for decades before meeting its end, allegedly decapitated by vandals overnight into Wednesday. It’s unclear who was behind the act, with church staff saying they found the statue early on Wednesday morning with its head already separated from its body, lying nearby on the ground. Although the church is equipped with security cameras, Deacon Edivaldo da Silva told local media that CCTV footage would hardly be helpful to identify those responsible, as none of the cameras show the damaged statue. Still, the Archdiocese of Miami believes the circumstances of the case point to foul play, rather than to an unfortunate accident. Jesus statue found vandalized at a church in Kendall. The Archdiocese of Miami wants it investigated as a hate crime@WPLGLocal10pic.twitter.com/8Xvf0Yhmvk “This is not something you can trip over and say, ‘Oh, sorry,’ – Someone did this intentionally,”spokesperson Mary Ross Agosta told local media. Agosta said the church sees it as not merely an act of vandalism – which has been on the rise in the wake of the George Floyd protests, with activists toppling statues of historical figures across the country – but an“an attack on the church”that should be investigated as a“hate crime.” The archdiocese noted that the suspected hate-fueled attack on the statue is not an isolated incident, and that the Catholic Church as a whole has faced an avalanche of similar attacks recently. This is another attack on the Catholic Church which is happening across the country. Miami-Dade police have launched a probe into the incident. Last Saturday, a statue of Mary was set on fire in St. Peter’s Parish Church in Dorchester, Massachusetts, with police saying that suspects ignited the plastic flowers the statue was holding. On July 10, a 100-year-old statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the entrance of Cathedral Preparatory School and Seminary in New York was spray painted with the word ‘IDOL’. The NYPD are investigating the incident as criminal mischief. The ongoing spree of vandalism has swept the country amidst a wave of blacklivesmatter protests, which kicked off in May, triggered by the killing of an unarmed black man in police custody. While initially aimed at statues of Confederate generals and slave owners, the removal crusade quickly escalated, and saw activists cheering the toppling of Christopher Columbus statues and those of former US presidents. As the onslaught on historical monuments continued, some of the most radical BLM proponents, such as racial activist Shaun King, suggested that activists set their eyes on“white Jesus”statues, calling them a manifestation of“white supremacy.” “Yes, I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down,”King tweeted.“They are a form of white supremacy.

"16 Jul, 2020",Danish ice cream maker to rebrand ‘Eskimo’ desserts over RACISM concerns,"Danish ice cream maker Hansens Is will rebrand its ‘Eskimo’ desserts over apparent racist connotations, following complaints by a politician from Greenland. The move was met with mixed reaction online. ""After much thorough reflection, we have decided to give our Popsicle ‘Eskimo’ a new and more appropriate name,”Hansens Is said in a Facebookpost, citing the ongoing global debate over“derogatory treatment and inequality towards minorities and indigenous people.” The company has opted to call the chocolate-coated vanilla treat“O’Payo,”the name of the chocolate used in making the dessert. According to the social media statement, the offensively-branded sweets will remain on sale until the“warehouse is exhausted,” at which point the politically correct packaging will appear. The decision was made after Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a politician representing Greenland in the Danish parliament, claimed the term means“eater of raw meat.” “Eskimo has a pejorative meaning for many Greenlanders. So I think it is only natural to show this level of respect for us,”Larsen said. Greenland, a former Danish colony-turned province with a high degree of autonomy, boasts some 55,000 mostly Inuit inhabitants. “Didn’t know Eskimo was condescending... I think it’s discrimination against me to change history to make others happy... so no more Hansen ice cream in my freezer,”wrote one clearly upset Facebook user. “The story doesn’t go away because you stick your head in the bush,”added another. One commenter cited the 10,000+ ‘angry’ reactions to the Facebook announcement as an indication of how poorly the decision was received by fans of the frozen lolly, to which a fellow Dane pointedly responded:“F**k the ordinary Danes’ attitude about something that isn’t about them.” In mid-June, Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream changed the name of its ‘Eskimo Pie’, which had been on sale since 1920, to avoid offending any Arctic peoples. However, Danish ice cream maker Premier opted not to bend the knee to the PC brigade and said it would keep its ‘Kaempe Eskimo’ (Giant Eskimo) ice cream name. “But we do not see at all that the name is associated with racism and may offend anyone. It is, in turn, a name associated with nostalgia,”Premier Is Director Claus Dahlmann Larsen said. The debate echoes similarcontroversieselsewhere, with a number of companies opting to change well-known brand names and logos, such as Uncle Ben’s rice, Aunt Jemima’s syrup and many others, amid the groundswell of anti-racist sentiment in recent months, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan was hospitalized with a broken finger and required stitches after a group of demonstrators attacked him and two other officers on the bridge during a ‘Stop the Violence’ protest on Wednesday. Two other cops – a lieutenant and a sergeant, according to local media – were left bleeding from minor head wounds, according to photos released by the NYPD. These are the injuries our officers sustained.pic.twitter.com/KI9wQKywHH At least 37 people were arrested during the demonstration, which was backed by NYPD union the Sergeants Benevolent Association. Video of the altercation shows a counter-protester running along the upper level of an on-ramp to the bridge and hitting the cops with a big stick as they struggled with two other protesters through a fence. It’s not clear how the skirmish began. Pro-cop protesters, including elected officials, police unions, church groups, and community leaders, marched across the bridge only to come face to face with counter-demonstrators from the Occupy City Hall protest, many of whom have been camped out in a park near City Hall (and the on-ramp to the bridge) demanding Mayor Bill de Blasio defund the NYPD to the tune of $1 billion. The city’s budget was submitted weeks ago, yet some occupiers remain in the park. Monahan, a 38-year officer from the Bronx, was actually filmed hugging protesters and ‘taking a knee’ during a protest last month in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park. However, he also spoke out against a City Council bill introduced earlier this month banning the use of diaphragm-pressing restraint holds – typically involving pressing a knee into a suspect’s back – claiming criminalizing the tactic would be “dangerous.” New York has seen a spike in crime led by a major uptick in shootings – June of 2020 was the most violent month since 1996 – exacerbated by bail reform, the coronavirus pandemic, and the devastating economic shutdowns that have plunged millions of Americans into poverty. At the same time, the police killing of black security guard George Floyd in Minneapolis in May has triggered months of sometimes-violent protests across the nation, accompanied by a steep rise in anti-cop sentiment. Monahan lamented earlier this month that “it’s tough to be a police officer now.” Pro- and anti-police demonstrators also clashed in Brooklyn over the weekend, occasionally coming to blows, and a New York Post reporter was allegedly struck in the face by a protester at Manhattan’s City Hall on Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio has drawn the ire of both sides as he refuses to make a firm commitment to backing either the police, the protesters, or the city business owners and residents caught between both – outside of cosmetic gestures like painting “ blacklivesmatter ” outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, of course.

Despite being presented as a harmless alternative to more violent methods of apprehension, netizens were immediately skeptical. Washington, DC police have been testing out the controversial electronic lasso, designed to take suspects down without hurting them, NBCreported. The ‘BolaWrap’ is a handheld device that looks like a Taser and shoots a cord as far as 25 feet that wraps around a person s legs. Robert Liberati, the Landover Hills town police chief has already ordered one lasso for each of his officers.“You’re immobilized temporarily enough, hopefully, that officers can get to you, get you under control and apprehended with as little injury as possible,”he said of the device’s proposed functionality. Some on social media noticed something disturbing about the BolaWrap, however. One person pointed out that while it’s not intended to be painful,“every person seen ‘testing’ [the device] is wearing a protective layer.” ""Not intended to be painful,"" and yet every person seen here ""testing"" them is wearing a protective layer. Goodbye. That is likely because there are in fact hooks at the end of its cord that can pierce the skin. “There are however small hooks at the end of the rope that could pierce the skin”pic.twitter.com/dgDBlgeiBn The new police tool comes on the heels of the anti-racism and anti-police brutality movement sweeping the country, which was sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a cop in Minnesota. Some claimed that the addition of these new weapons to the police arsenal proved that they were missing the point of the protest movement — particularly given the fact that they used a black man in the testing video for the device. And to make matters worse, let s show a photo of a bunch of white cops trying it out on a black man. One user even felt there was a“slave catcher aesthetic”to the new tool. Another tweeter said police were not even trying to be“anything other than violent, brutal and terrifying.” Nothing about how police departments across the country have responded to criticism since June has indicated that they are even trying to be anything other than violent, brutal and terrifying.https://t.co/WgK0Tljh4S A few were happy the new device was being deployed however, with one saying it would lead to more“easy”arrests.

The action drew a mixed response online. The black resin and steel figure was erected in Bristol by a small team led by artist Marc Quinn at around 5am local time, the Guardian reported. It is said they worked as quickly as possible fearing that officials could arrive to stop them. The sculpture is a re-creation of a photo of Black Live Matter protester Jen Reid standing on an empty pedestal with her fist raised shortly after the statue of Colston was toppled last month. Quinn told the Guardian that the new statue was installed in such a manner that it would be“extremely difficult to move,”though it is“not a permanent artwork.” City officials did not react to the statue as of Wednesday morning, the paper said. The more than 100-year-old monument to Colston – a wealthy merchant and politician involved in the slave trade – was destroyed amid a wave of vandalism against statues of historical figures strongly associated by activists with slavery, racism, and colonialism. Quinn’s project drew a mixed response on Twitter. Some welcomed the sculpture, calling it“fantastic,”“wonderful,”and“absolutely brilliant.” The statue of Reid was praised by Angela Harrelson, the aunt of George Floyd, a black American man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis, Minnesota police sparked widespread protests in the US and other Western countries.“Powerful story!”Harrelsonwroteonline.“Seeing things like this, validates that my nephew death is not on vain.” Others, however, were not so thrilled about the monument to the protester. Commenters accused the activists of“disrespect”to the city because they did not obtain a permit for erecting the sculpture. The action was“obnoxious and undemocratic,” one personwrote. Another Twitter warriorarguedthat BLM does not represent everyone in Bristol, and the statue must be taken down and replaced by something“reflecting the diversity of the people who live there.” One personwrotethat allowing the statue of Reid to stand will set“a dangerous precedent,”paving the way for“statues from both sides popping up all over the place and there to be chaos.” ",https://www.rt.com/uk/494770-edward-colston-blm-statue/
"13 Jul, 2020",NBA blasted after viral video shows ban on custom ‘FREE HONG KONG’ jerseys but no ban on other contentious messages,"The NBA is once again being accused of bowing to China, after a viral video revealed its website does not allow custom jerseys with the phrase “Free Hong Kong,” but has no problem with plenty of other disruptive messages. “The NBA bans you, the fan, from putting #freehongkong on customized league jerseys even as they allow players to wear customized jerseys,”journalist Clay Travis tweeted on Sunday. Travis Included a video actually showing the merchandising section of the website rejecting the phrase. Numerous people took to social media to give other firsthand accounts of the site not allowing the message. The NBA bans you, the fan, from putting#freehongkongon customized league jerseys even as they allow players to wear customized jerseys.pic.twitter.com/px9enQa1qk “We are unable to customize this item with the text you have entered. Please try a different entry,”is the warning one receives after trying to enter“free Hong Kong”into the ‘name’ section of the store. The basketball league has generated controversy over the years, due to its deference to China and  silencing employees from speaking out about the anti-government protests that have raged in Hong Kong. What is surprising in this instance is the range of messages that are allowed on the custom jerseys. The warning does not appear if you type in“Heil Hitler,”for example. Or“Schutzstaffel,”the full name of the notorious SS that worked under Adolf Hitler during World War II. Other racist or Nazi phrases like“KKK”and“white power”are flagged. The uncensored version of“F**k police”is also okay. Political messages like“defund police”do not raise any flags with the system. Strangely enough, “Free Tibet” is allowed. This likely means that there is no general ban in place for offensive or political statements, but that specific phrases are flagged by the system,“Free Hong Kong”being one of them. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage with the league. You can, however, FREEBINGBONG.Or RUINHONGKONG.Or choose an ethnicity to append to ""KILL.""Or feel free to offer NAZIS your favorite compliment.But no FREEHONGKONG.https://t.co/Be8py0tZ4C The NBA s store will let you design and purchase custom jerseys with user-created messages like ""KILLCOPS"" and ""MURDERPOLICE"" and ""BURN JEWS.""But if you try to customize a jersey that says ""FreeHongKong,"" the NBA won t let you.https://t.co/2HqpOu393S First Academia, now NBA.Transparency about ties to Communist China is very important.https://t.co/vcdi0lkhC9 The NBA recently allowed players to wear custom jerseys with a narrow range of approved social justice and political messages. Kyle Korver, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, recently decided to emblazon“ blacklivesmatter ”ontohis. Stephen Curry also gifted former President Barack Obama with his own customjerseyin 2016. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) wrote an open letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver about player jerseys this week, accusing the league of censorship for only allowing certain political messages. If@NBAis going to put social cause statements on uniforms, why not “Support our Troops” or “Back the Blue”? Or given how much $$@nbamakes in#China, how about “Free Hong Kong”! Today I wrote to Adam Silver to ask for answerspic.twitter.com/PthYR4OxmE Great question from@HawleyMO: Why can t NBA players have ""Free Hong Kong"" on their jerseys?#MoneyTalkshttps://t.co/48nyt2e5Tj Accusations of the league censoring in favor of China first gained traction when Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests, but quickly deleted it in October of last year. Morey was even criticized by star player LeBron James for being“misinformed”about the situation in Hong Kong, leading James to be accused by many –  including Hong Kong residents – of hypocrisy and support for communism. James, like many other players, have meanwhile felt free to get politically involved in US issues, criticizing President Donald Trump and showing solidarity with the protests over police brutality and racial inequality continuing across the country since the May 25 death of George Floyd.

"13 Jul, 2020",What a riot! Minnesota requesting White House aid is like kid calling Dad after wrecking family car while driving drunk,"The White House has rejected the state of Minnesota’s request for emergency funds to help rebuild the city of Minneapolis. The decision was harsh, but right: taxpayers should never be required to bail out bad leadership. Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Robert Bridge is an American writer and journalist. He is the author of Midnight in the American Empire, How Corporations and Their Political Servants are Destroying the American Dream.@Robert_Bridge Minnesota Governor Tim Walz last week made what must have been the most uncomfortable call of his political career. Having just witnessed on his watch a large swath of Minneapolis – the largest city in his state – reduced to rubble and ash amid ‘peaceful’ blacklivesmatter protests, Walz was in desperate need of cash to start the rebuilding process. Had the Democratic leader been surprised by Donald Trump’srejectionof the $500-million request, he probably should never have gotten into politics in the first place. The reason for Trump’s rejection, however, cannot be explained away as just another example of bitter partisan politics. Minnesota’s handling of the protests following George Floyd’s death on May 25 provided a classic textbook example of how not to appease the mob, which can never be appeased. As peaceful demonstrations against police abuse were quickly hijacked by malcontents with mass destruction on the brain, one thing became clear: the local and state authorities had no strategy whatsoever, unless allowing vandals to run wild through the city center can be considered a viable strategy. I live in Minneapolis & I agree we should not have the Feds pay for our rebuilding. This is on our inept .@GovTimWalz& wimpy .@MayorFrey. Of course that means they will tax us even more heavily. Typical Liberals: allow destruction & violence, then look for others to fix it all. Two days after Floyd’s death, the US media, for reasons known only to them, showed themselves incapable of pronouncing or writing the four-letter word known as“RIOT”to describe the ensuing mayhem. That lack of media candidness, deeply connected to political correctness, may have encouraged the bad actors to continue with their own, customized trail oftears. In any case, the situation got so bad that firefighters refused to respond to emergencies without the police, who weren’t much help anyways since it was the police that the mob was hunting for. Business owners, meanwhile, not relishing the idea of losing a lifetime of labor, were forced to guard their establishments with rifles in hand, Wild West-style. The crowning cherry on this cake baked in hell’s kitchen came with the destruction of the Third Precinct, after Mayor Jason Frey ordered police officers to vacate their headquarters. Amid this stunning breakdown of law and order, Trump said he would be willing to supply Minneapolis with“troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military.”All things considered, it was nice of him to offer. Nevertheless, the possibility of a Republican leader helping to put down a racially motivated uprising in a major Democratic state, naturally did not sit well with the Left, least of all in a major election year. In any case, Governor Walz had already placed an order with the Minnesota National Guard to address the emergency. As it turned out, however, the members of the militia would not see much action because, as The New York Timesreported, Walz“expressed surprise that city leaders did not seem to have a plan for where they wanted the soldiers to go.” It’s just a wild hunch, but I’m guessing the set pieces should have gone wherever the looters were looting and the buildings were burning, for starters. Does it make any sense to call soldiers away from their day jobs if nobody has a clue where to send them? How does one begin to explain such political incompetence? Perhaps local leaders imagined that by letting their city’s police precinct and dozens of other buildings burn to the ground, the anger and frustration of the mob would simply evaporate with the smoke. If that was the strategy, it proved to be disastrously wrongheaded. In fact, some of the more radical protesters, of which there seemed to be no shortage, felt confident enough toforwardthe outrageous demand that the city fathers begin defunding and even disbanding its police force. That sounds about as smart as shutting down pharmacies at the height of the flu season. There is a very strong temptation here to argue that the Minnesota authorities, as well as authorities in other cities across the nation, failed to take the necessary action against the troublemakers for fear of further enraging the mob. Indeed, the desire to comply with the controversial demands advanced by a number of organizations, not least of all BLM and Antifa, has actually motivated some metropolitan areas, like New York City, todecoratetheir streets with huge ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ slogans. Although few people would disagree with the statement, it seems that too many political leaders have lost all sense of balance, proportion and even duty when it comes to their decision-making process. Too many are afraid of being branded ‘haters’ when the question of enforcing the law is at hand. Minnesota’s tepid response to civil discord seems to prove the point – from the media refusing to call a spade a spade, to the authorities refusing to take necessary action against outright criminal behavior – that the mob mentality is gradually winning out over law and order. Although the question of police abuse deserves a serious public debate, the final response must be an intelligent one, as opposed to one that destroys the same streets where George Floyd once lived, as the police watch from the sidelines. Eventually, whether they want it or not, political leaders must accept personal responsibility for their actions. Had Trump caved in and forked over hundreds of millions of dollars to Minnesota for nothing more than an appalling response to criminality, other cities and states would be taking the same lax approach. Now they will be forced to think twice about their actions. US taxpayers should not be required to reward incompetence any more than our political leaders should make their decisions based on what they believe to be politically expedient. The law is the law, and nobody should be considered above it. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/494641-minnesota-emergency-white-house/

"13 Jul, 2020","Shelter in places apart and unequal: Topple all the monuments you want, but the real racism’s going unaddressed","America pulls down monuments to racist oppressors, renames streets and paints blacklivesmatter all over them. But the real inequalities of cities like Chicago – rooted in class as well as race – are left to fester. ByPaul Street,the author of numerous books, including They Rule: The 1% v. Democracy (Routledge, 2014) and The Empire s New Clothes: Barack Obama in the Real World of Power (Routledge, 2011). Paul Street’s latest book isHollow Resistance: Obama, Trump, and the Politics of Appeasement(CounterPunch Books, September 2020). Follow Paul on Twitter@Streetwriter17 It is good to see Confederate war memorials coming down and under attack in the American South. The Confederacy was a treasonous campaign to keep black people in bondage. It arose and seceded from the United States, leading to a Civil War that killed more than half a million Americans, because top southern slaveholdersdeterminedthat the presidency of Abraham Lincoln represented a mortal threat to the forced labor and torture system that was black chattel slavery. But symbolic change only goes so far. America can take down all the racist historical monuments it wants. It can strip slave owners’ and slave traders’ names from every structure they befoul. It can paint“ blacklivesmatter ”on every major thoroughfare in the nation. But substance matters more than symbols, just as deeds matter more than words (you know, like“hope”and“change”). The technically black Barack Obama held the White House in the land of cotton slavery for eight years. During his presidency, Black Americans experienced an epic collapse in networth.“Racially disparate mass incarceration”(a nice academic phrase for the disproportionate mass arrest and imprisonment of black and brown people) and racist police brutality proceeded apace while liberals congratulated themselves for having voted (twice) for a (deeply conservative) first blackpresident(an imperial Wall Street president who lectured poor blacks on their own responsibility for their poverty while bailing out financial institutions that collapsed black wealth along with the US and global economies). Take my hometown, Chicago, the one-third black city that Obama deceptively claimed to hail from. It recently elected a black, female and gay mayor (a symbolic identity politics trifecta!) and named one its leading downtown streets after the 20th century black civil rights activist Ida B. Wells.  Black people are highly visible on the city’s nightly television news teams, in its sports and entertainment culture and across its entire roster of elected officials. Good. Has symbolic change challenged the massive concentration of deep Black poverty across vast ghettoized swaths of the city’s South and West Sides? Has it brought new opportunity and uplifted those communities? Has superficially integrated Chicago made any substantive effort to reverse the flows of profit, development, andprivilegefrom the richest and whitest parts of the city and metropolitan area to the poorest and most black parts of the metropolis?  Has it switched tax incrementfinancingsurpluses and other government subsidies from lining the already deep pockets of downtown developers to creating affordable housing, livable wage jobs, medical resources, and green spaces in the city’s multiply oppressed Blackcommunities? Has it begun to compensate those communities for more than acenturyof harsh housing and school segregation, restrictive covenants, red-lining, disinvestment, employment discrimination, gentrification, and police-state torture and terrorism? Has Chicago moved to dismantle the giant racist holding pen and coronavirus breedinggroundcalled Cook County Jail?  Has it de-funded its viciously racist and militarized policedepartment, diverting the taxpayer fortune it spends on repression to social protection and enrichment in the city’s communities of greatest need? No, it has not.  And it’s the same in every other American metropolis. Americans need to think about“place”in social as well as spatial terms. They also need to understand the longstanding core national problems of race at a deeper, class-informed level beyond just the color of faces in high places and symbols in public spaces. They could start by reflecting on how differently the phrase“shelter in place”plays out across the nation’s interwoven boundaries of race and class. Think about the spaces where disproportionately middle- and upper-class people have“sheltered in place”in Chicago this year. Comfortable city residents have been harboring in the vast, predominantly white affluent stretches of the city’sNorth Sidealong with other cozy semi-integrated pockets in South Side neighborhoods like Hyde Park and Beverly. Residents of these pleasing neighborhoods work from often spacious, nicely furnished, and well-stocked homes, in good-paying jobs that come with gold-plated health insurance plans. They have high-end coffee shops, health carry-outs, doctors’ and dentist offices, full-service grocery stores with organic food, and well-kept city parks and more nearby. (Some of these neighborhoods’ residents will almost sheepishly tell you that Covid-19 has been a delightful opportunity to work in the comfort of their homes without commutes, business suits, and direct oversight from senior authorities). Things are different in the shockingly impoverished and jobless ghettoes on Chicago’s South and West Sides. There, black Americans shelter in savagely separate and unequal places.  Grocery stores, banks, professional services, and green space are shockingly scarce in black Chicago. So are job networks and decent, well-funded schools. Sidewalks and parking lots in these neighborhoods are strewn with broken glass alongside boarded-up storefronts and ubiquitous liquor stores. Air conditioning is a luxury and social distancing is difficult in overcrowded, rent-racked apartments with shelves that are often all-too-bare. Heavily armed police patrol warily and menacingly. Life expectancy, already low, is plummeting in these neighborhoods as residents struggle with numerous pre-existing“co-morbidities”– including the lack of health insurance and a scarcity of medical services – that make Covid-19 especially dangerous. To make matters worse, Black Chicagoans have been especially exposed to the virus thanks to their disproportionate presence in front-line service jobs.“Working from home,”noted the journalist Carlos Ballesteros last April in theChicago Sun Times,“is not an option for most Black and Latino workers during the coronavirus crisis.” None of this is unique to Chicago. America is telling tens of millions of black Americans to shelter in savagely unequal place as the uncompensated and living, compound-interestlegaciesof slavery, Jim Crow, ghettoization, and more steal and maim black lives on an elevated scale in the coronavirus era. Is it any wonder that many urban black Americans exploded in rage after George Floyd was killed by white police officers in Minneapolis? And that some Black Americans came out of their assigned places to attack property and appropriate goods not just in their own assigned communities but in downtown commercial centers like Chicago’s Loop and Midtown Manhattan? Or that urban black America could be looking at a long, hot violence-pronesummeras misery mounts in the nation’s worst-off places? More statues will come down, more“ blacklivesmatter ”signs will go up, more street names will change. Fine. What’s really required is a massive redirection of wealth and resources understood as reparations not just for past racial oppression but for ongoing systemic and institutional racism, deeply understood – and a related frontal assault on the soulless class-rule profits system that has always underpinned American racism. “The real issue to be faced”beyond surface matters like the technical skin color of an elected official, the socialist Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote near the end of his life,“is the radical reconstruction of society itself.”There’s a word for that kind of reparation: revolution.

"11 Jul, 2020",Strident BLM activists are imposing their orthodoxy on race-related matters with a fervor approaching Red Scare McCarthyism,"Should the issue of racism really trump all of America’s other flaws, such as runaway wealth inequality, out of control military spending, a corrupt finance system, an oligarchic mass media, and a throttled democracy? ByDavid Kerans, historian of Russia and financial analyst. He has held appointments at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale Universities, as well as at Wall Street investment houses. Headcounters inform us that 15 to 25 million people have turned up in the past six weeks for demonstrations related to blacklivesmatter (BLM), making this one of the biggest waves of civic engagement in American history. A few reforms to policing are under discussion, and we see some shifts in political leanings – polls indicate enthusiasm for Trump ebbing, pessimism about the direction of the country rising, and support for reduced funding of police departments. But surely something broader is afoot? It isn’t difficult to see that the BLM movement is making a real mark in two ways. In the conceptual realm, many BLM-supporting scholars are promoting an unabashedly narrow understanding of the driving forces of American history and power structures, ardently centered on racialoppression. On the ground, meanwhile, a strong current of left illiberalism has taken shape, wherein a minority of strident activists are imposing their orthodoxy on race-related matters with a fervor approaching Red Scare McCarthyism. Andrew Sullivan, writing in The Intelligencer, has aptly characterized BLM’s analytical approach: “It sees America as in its essence not about freedom but oppression. It argues, in fact, that all the ideals about individual liberty, religious freedom, limited government, and the equality of all human beings were always a falsehood to cover for and justify and entrench the enslavement of human beings under the fiction of race. It wasn’t that these values competed with the poison of slavery, and eventually overcame it…. It’s that the liberal system is itself a form of white supremacy… “This view of the world certainly has “moral clarity.” What it lacks is moral complexity. No country can be so reduced to one single prism and damned because of it. American society has far more complexity and history has far more contingency than can be jammed into this rubric.” Allow yourself a moment to survey the country’s primary problems. Your list might include: Runaway global warming, plausibly a threat to all forms of life on earth within the foreseeable future. A finance system that fuels corruption and capital flight from all over the world to“offshore”bankinghavens– meaning primarily UK dependencies and the US – thereby hollowing out their tax bases, and ours. The amounts are staggering, in the tens of trillions ofdollars. Runaway wealth inequality, which correlatespersuasivelyto every measurable human pathology, across every geography, across all wealth groups. The biological consequences of the stresses accompanying inequality are heavy, and even punish therich, as Richard G Wilkinson and Kate Pickett elaborate throughout their book The Spirit Level. About 150 millionAmericanslive with chronic disease, attributable partly to pollution from pesticides, plastics, pharmaceuticals, etc, and, likely also to the stress effects of wealth inequality. The Pentagon’s colossal budget –unauditableand thus unaccountable to Congress – sucking out ever increasing resources, and inclining the US to stoke international tensions so as to justify the river of money. A higher-education constellation steered more to producing profit than mature citizens, with a consequent erosion of America’s humancapitalon various planes. A throttled democracy, where the trivial controls over campaign fundraising allow big-money donors and corporations to influence politicians. SenatorDick Durbin(D-Illinois) expressed his despair about crafting meaningful banking regulations back in 2009:“…the banks …frankly own the place.”And so the stimulus package gives hundreds of billions to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin with virtually nocontrolsand with corruptoutcomes, but without public uproar. An oligarchic mass media that erects a“wall of propaganda”(political commentator Cenk Uygur’s phrasing) against anything smelling like social democracy – and, I would add, any gesture of rapprochement with Russia, among other taboo subjects, including climate change, and militaryintervention. Are any of these issues dependent on the legacy of American slavery? America has myriad challenges to face, the vestiges of slavery and racism among them, not above them. Contorting analytical approaches to prioritize the perspective of racial oppression obscures more than it illuminates. America needs citizens better informed on all of the crises listed above. The trajectory of the George Floyd demonstrations seems to illustrate the risk of BLM becoming myopic.BLMarchitects in the academy insist that the goal is to end“racial capitalism”via a color-consciousversionof social democracy, but the race-grievance dimension – once presented as all-eclipsing – drowns out all other messages. And so the mass media has easily channeled the demonstrations into very narrow terrain: demands to reduce police budgets and ensure accountability for rogue cops. (Not so long ago, be it noted, BLM leadership cozied up to numerous corporate donors, and has looked decidedly not revolutionary to keen critics such as social commentatorPaul Street.) Meanwhile, BLM’s self-righteous repudiation of America has found potent application in its culture wars. An armada of aggressive online social-justice warriors has honed a seemingly unbridled“cancel culture”– including iconoclasm (toppling statues, for example), conformity control (condemning the phrase“all lives matter”, or anythingelsethat might somehowdiluteanti-racist messaging), demanding participatory anti-racism on their terms (“silence is violence”,for instance), denunciations (branding any level of skepticism racist, and often insisting that beliefs straying from their line threaten the physical safety of blackpeople), and punishment. Plenty of people accused of racism – or simply racial insensitivity, orless– have been fired, some even after making self-abasing confessions to their perceived sins, because their employer fears the wrath of the woke mob. BLM did not invent any dimension of cancel culture, ie, the exclusion of tainted persons, groups or institutions from communication venues or respectful attention. Recall, for instance, the McCarthyist anti-communist witch hunts, or the establishment’s branding of anyone doubting the Russiagate narrative as a“Putin apologist.”But BLM’s stridency and moral certitude has fomented cancel culture. Cancel culture is not risk-free to progressive causes. In 2017, its #metoo emanation claimed the career of Senator Al Franken, one of the most progressive senators – an outcome many of his colleaguesregret. And this is not an epiphenomenon. On July 7, Harper’s Magazine published anopen letterfrom more than 150 cultural luminaries, including left-wing icons Noam Chomsky and Gloria Steinem, expressing grave alarm over“… a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate… in favor of ideological conformity”,“a vogue for public shaming and ostracism”, a “tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty”, and“calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought.” They warn that“resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion,”and lament the cowardly obedience of corporate and university leaders in bowing to digital woke-mob demands.“We are already paying the price in greater risk aversion among writers, artists, and journalists, who fear for their livelihoods if they depart from the consensus or even lack sufficient zeal in agreement. This stifling atmosphere will ultimately harm the most vital causes of our time.” Let’s hope that message gets through. ",https://www.rt.com/op-ed/494369-blm-activists-us-mccarthyism/

The couple’s attorney had reportedly taken possession of the pistol already. In St Louis, when you defend yourself, the local prosecutor goes after you in a disgusting abuse of power. The Missouri AG weighs in on FOX News at Night as the McCloskey family is under siege.pic.twitter.com/2OG3jj5yA7 So far, no charges have been filed against the McCloskeys, who called the police and armed themselves after more than 100 demonstrators broke through a gate near their property en route to protest in front of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson’s house. The couple claimed protesters were explicitly threatening to kill them, burn their house down, and even kill their pets, insisting they only armed themselves upon seeing several demonstrators with weapons. However, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner is reportedly investigating the incident, having made clear her stance on the matter from the outset with a statement condemning how “peaceful protesters were met by guns and a violent assault.” No shots were fired during the confrontation, nor was any physical contact reported between the demonstrators and the McCloskeys. Gardner is one of several “progressive” prosecutors elected in the past few years whose campaign was bankrolled by billionaire currency speculator George Soros, and her behavior in office has hewed close to what one might expect from a Soros-backed district attorney, from releasing every person arrested during weeks of rioting following the police killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day in Minneapolis to prosecuting the state’s Republican governor for alleged invasion of privacy back in 2017. Video of the standoff between the McCloskeys and the protesters polarized Americans, with most on the right viewing it as a brave act of “stand your ground” self-defense and most on the left deeming it a craven display of white privilege, dubbing the pair “Ken and Karen” and mocking their apparent lack of firearms training. Ironically, Mark McCloskey recently represented a victim of police brutality in his personal injury law practice, securing federal charges against the officer. Missouri has relatively permissive gun laws, and defenders of the McCloskeys have argued the couple were well within their rights to protect their own property, while the protesters were trespassing on a private street. However, their detractors have countered that pointing weapons at peaceful demonstrators constitutes assault, calling for the gun-wielding couple to be disbarred, arrested, or worse.

"10 Jul, 2020",Robert Fuller ‘lynching’ rumors dismissed as probe finds hanging victim heard voices & was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts,"The death of Robert Fuller, declared a lynching by blacklivesmatter activists after he was found hanging from a tree outside Los Angeles, was confirmed as a suicide – but many are hesitant to trust the probe’s result. Fuller, a 24-year-old black man discovered hanging from a tree near City Hall in the Los Angeles suburb of Palmdale, heard voices telling him to kill himself and was repeatedly hospitalized for suicidal ideation before his death, according to the LA County Sheriff’s Department, which revealed the results of its investigation at a press conference on Thursday. While Fuller’s death had been ruled a suicide weeks ago after his body was found hanging in a park, with authorities finding no signs of a crime at the scene, his outraged family had demanded a more thorough probe, hiring an independent medical examiner to conduct their own autopsy. However, the sheriff’s department not only found that Fuller had purchased the rope used in the grisly deed using his own EBT benefits card, but that he had been hospitalized three times since 2017, each time due to suicidal ideation. He was most recently institutionalized in November in Nevada, having “disclosed that he did have a plan to kill himself,” Sheriff’s Commander Chris Marks revealed, adding that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had responded in February to an incident where Fuller “allegedly tried to light himself on fire.” LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva acknowledged the investigation had been “one of the easier ones,” suggesting it “demonstrates why the public needs to trust the Sheriff’s Department.” He blamed the Board of Supervisors for promoting a “conspiracy theory” about Fuller’s death, forcing the department to allocate extra resources to the case at the expense of other investigations. Completely sick how badly how so many inthe comments seem to NEED to see hate crimes and racially motivated killings. Now, they re trying actually to rationalize suicidal thoughts and claiming that ""no black man"" would ever commit suicide in this specific way... unbelivable. Many locals seemed eager to pin Fuller’s death on Palmdale residents, however, with over a thousand people coming out for a protest in the park where he died in the days after his body was found. The sheriff acknowledged that the case had “brought a lot of attention” in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which touched off months of protests across the US against police brutality and racism, and implored LA County officials to boost funding for mental health and housing programs. His family had said this over and over from the time he was found. He had been suicidal for years. But the ""protestors"" didn t listen and they started acting out and screaming they wanted justice for him🤦‍♀️ Goes to show they don t care or need a reason to keep doing what they do Fuller’s half-brother was killed a week after his suicide after allegedly opening fire on Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies, who were attempting to arrest him for beating and holding his girlfriend captive for almost a week. The hanging was far from a closed case for observers on social media, however. Many expressed disbelief that it was possible to buy rope with an EBT card, the benefits from which are subject to a byzantine array of rules forbidding the purchase of everything from hot food to sanitary pads. Since when is ROPE an allowable expense???? Women can’t buy pads or tampons but that man bought ROPE??? Since when is rope a food item eligible for EBT purchase? Others simply refused to accept the results of the investigation – no reasons needed. I just keep having a hard time imagining a black man hanging himself near city hall...the ""town square"" if you will...I have a hard time with that idea... The thing about ""authorities"" is...they have no credibility and have given us no reason to take their word for anything 🤷🏽‍♀️ ",https://www.rt.com/usa/494329-robert-fuller-suicide-lynching-blm/
"10 Jul, 2020","Twitter data-mining tool Dataminr fed police real-time info on blacklivesmatter protesters, despite promises not to spy","An analytics firm parsing Twitter data in real time for law enforcement and media has been caught funneling detailed info on anti-police-brutality marches to the very agencies users are protesting, despite promises not to. Dataminr, a CIA-funded artificial intelligence startup that mines Twitter’s real-time content stream for behavioral patterns and other analytics, has been caught feeding info on police brutality protesters from that “firehose” stream back to law enforcement. While the developers had promised they wouldn’t enable domestic surveillance after a series of scandals in 2016, Dataminr is once again doing just that,the Interceptrevealed on Thursday, slurping up Twitter data from participants in the ongoing George Floyd demonstrations and sending it to the very authorities those people are protesting. Twitter has vocally supported Black activists and the#BlackLivesMattermovement. But that is not enough. In this fight for racial justice,@Twittermust act decisively to prevent the government from exploiting the platform to surveil and target the company’s users.pic.twitter.com/98wEwsKH4P The app was forced to promise it would not use its privileged access to Twitter data to enable domestic surveillance in 2016 after the company was caught feeding law enforcement “fusion centers” – liaison offices between federal and local police – real-time information from Twitter’s firehose. This capability, which Dataminr bragged about in its marketing materials, flagrantly violated Twitter’s own policy against weaponizing user data for surveillance purposes. While Dataminr indeed pledged to stop providing social media surveillance capabilities to “any local, state, or federal government customer,” the company has continued to offer its “News Alert” service to law enforcement and “organizations supporting first responders.” Confronted with the fact of its surveillance of the George Floyd protests, executives have even argued that Dataminr’s surveillance of protests is actually keeping demonstrators safe, claiming its Big Brotheresque snooping “helps magnify [protesters’] voice[s].” However, an inside source who spoke to the Intercept confirmed Dataminr’s biggest clients remain local police departments hungry for data on protesters, adding that the app has “relayed tweets and other social media content about the George Floyd and blacklivesmatter protests directly to police, apparently across the country,” using its “privileged access to Twitter data” – never mind that its terms of service stipulations barred any of the platform’s software partners from “tracking, alerting, or monitoring sensitive events (such as protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings).” Indeed, the FBI even signed an “expedited agreement” to expand its relationship with Dataminr last month, piling on to an existing $1 million contract. A spokesperson for the app insists it has only provided the FBI with “First Alert, a product that delivers breaking news alerts on emergency events, such as natural disasters, fires, explosions, and shootings.” However, it’s unclear how the sort of information that might come over a 911 scanner would be worth $1 million to the top US domestic law enforcement agency. Tweets like “Protesters seen sitting on street in front of security officers in Oakdale, MN” wouldn’t seem to have any immediate utility for first responders or any other emergency services, for example, yet these found their way to the Minneapolis Police Department with the help of Dataminr. And the app’s surveillance of blacklivesmatter went far beyond basic after-the-fact data about the protests, the Intercept’s sources confirmed, calling Dataminr’s and Twitter’s claims they don’t enable domestic surveillance “bulls**t.” “It’s true Dataminr doesn’t specifically track protesters and activists individually, but at the request of the police they are tracking protests, and therefore protesters,” the source told the outlet. Nor did Dataminr limit its surveillance to real-time monitoring – it allegedly kept “comprehensive records of upcoming anti-police violence rallies” in cities nationwide so as to allot adequate staff for monitoring the demonstrations as they unfolded. At any given time, the Intercept claims, Dataminr would be “explicitly surveiling dozens of protests big and small.” The cognitive dissonance hasn’t been lost on Dataminr employees – the source passed on a recording of a staff meeting in which a manager attempted to draw a distinction between “relaying data to the police” and “surveillance.” Police could “respond more quickly and save lives” when given “situational awareness through real time events.” Translation? Big Brother is just trying to help. ",https://www.rt.com/usa/494326-dataminr-twitter-protesters-police/
"9 Jul, 2020", Do they care? Minneapolis business owner left with nothing after riots calls out city officials for failing to help,"A salon owner in Minneapolis has been left with “nothing” after her business was “burned to the ground” in riots after the killing of George Floyd, and she says the city has done nothing to help with her predicament. “It hurts to know that I have no business. I have nothing,”Fiona WestbrookstoldFox and Friends on Thursday.“I don t even have a styling chair anymore, you know.” Westbrooks owned Flora’s Hair Designs in north Minneapolis for four decades before it was destroyed in riots on May 29. After hearing that her son’s business was burned by rioters, she checked on the salon and found“everything was all up in a big fire, just a big ball of fire, smoke and fire, and I couldn t believe it.” The business owner met with the Governor of Minnesota Tim Waltz and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn) after the blaze, but said she hasn’t had any contact from them since.“I wish I could hear something from the officials, the city or someone to let me know if they’re going to do anything,”she said, adding,“I m just left alone. I don t have any help.” I m wondering do they care? I have not heard anything so I just feel like I m just left out, you know, just out in left field here.

Follow him on Telegram@TheNebulatorand on Twitter@NebojsaMalic Take the case of two Californians who are facing ‘hate crime’ charges for painting over a blacklivesmatter mural outside the Contra Costa County courthouse during the Independence Day weekend. Nichole Anderson and David Nelson are being prosecuted by District Attorney Diana Becton, who described BLM as“an important civil rights cause that deservesallof our attention,”(emphasis added) and insisted that“we must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country.” A former judge with no prosecutorial experience and dogged by accusations of plagiarism, Becton was elected in 2018 thanksin no small partto $275,000 poured into her campaign by Soros. The Hungarian-born Democrat mega-donor became obscenely wealthy through currency speculation, before turning his eye towards influencing politics. In addition to funding various Democrats in state and congressional races, Soros invested heavily in local elections, where his money could make a much bigger difference. He specifically targeted district attorneys, who in the US make all the prosecutorial decisions on a local level. In 2018, he invested more than $2.7 million in DA races in California, according to theLos Angeles Times. This was on top of the more-than $16 million he spent since 2014 on 17 district attorney races across the US, with his candidates winning 13 of them. One of those candidates is Kim Gardner, the circuit attorney in St. Louis, Missouri since 2017. She returned the favor almost immediately, playing a key role in the prosecution of Republican Governor Eric Greitens over alleged invasion of privacy. The case eventually imploded, but not before it served its purpose in forcing Greitens to resign. Given Gardner’s history, it should not have come as a shock when she released every single person arrested during the George Floyd riots at the end of May, which claimed the life of retired police Captain David Dorn. Nor should it be a surprise that Gardner is currently trying to find a way to press charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who defended their house with a rifle and a handgun after a crowd of ‘peaceful’ blacklivesmatter protesters demolished the gate of their community last month. The McCloskeys have already beenvilifiedin the media as racist, for daring to stand up for their property against the mob that threatened to kill them, and they have had to board up the house due to repeated violent demonstrations outside. To make the irony even greater, Mark is a lawyer who has represented victims of police brutality. None of it matters to Gardner, of course – the Narrative must be served. Kim Foxx of Cook County, Illinois is another Soros-funded DA. She infamously tried to cover for actor Jussie Smollett after he staged a hate crime against himself in February 2019. Though Foxx dropped the charges, Smollett is now facing a special prosecutor. Even in races where Soros did not get directly involved, Democrats who won embraced his policy of ‘criminal justice reform’. While it sounds lofty in theory, in practice it has mainly consisted of refusing to prosecute most offenses committed by minorities in the name of ‘racial justice’. For years, Democrats have denounced ‘big money’ in politics. That rhetoric suddenly stopped once Soros became openly involved. Any time anyone brings this up, they denounce it as a“right-wing conspiracy theory”and even anti-Semitism – though the Israeli governmentbegs to differ. Yet the proof of the pudding is in selective prosecutions, driven by racial grievance-mongering and intended to send a message to Americans that some people are, actually, above the law.

"9 Jul, 2020",Trump hails Obama! How the US president has turned to his predecessor’s ugly methods of repressing dissent to tackle BLM,"The US leader has called Obama’s model for crushing the 2011 Occupy Wall St movement “beautiful” and is using it to label even peaceful BLM protestors as domestic terrorists. It’s police state stuff. The US Constitution’s Bill of Rights makes it crystal clear in the First Amendment to the nation’s founding document, added in 1791, when it states:“Congress shall make no law … abridging … the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” How, then, to explain what happened on June 1. On that day, President Donald Trump took a bizarre stroll out of the White House and across the little pocket park known as Lafayette Square (a traditional site for protests against everything from cruelty to animals to undeclared US wars on Third World nations) for a publicity photo shoot of him awkwardly holding a Bible in front of a boarded-up historic church. But prior to that clumsy stunt, his Attorney General William Barr had ordered a brigade of armored-up National Park Police, backed by a unit of National Guard troops, to attack a bunch of peaceful, unarmed and unwarned protesters, driving them from the vicinity with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The protesters had gathered earlier in the day outside the White House, in the park and on H Street in front of the old church, to “peaceably assemble” and to “petition” and make known to the president and Congress their anger and dismay over mounting police violence against black Americans. It was, at first, hard to understand what was happening and why. Was it just that the president was afraid to have his photo shoot marred by noisy but peaceful protesters? Earlier in the day he had given a strident and intemperate speech calling for state and city officials to “dominate” the streets to shut down protests taking place across the country – most of which were peaceful – in reaction to the brutal videotaped strangulation by a knee on the neck of George Floyd. A day later, theleaked transcript of a group phone call by President Trump, his Attorney General William Barr, and his Pentagon Secretary Mark Esper, to governors of all 50 US states, made it clear what was going on. On that call, Trump recalled an earlier period of national protests called the Occupy Movement, which had seen hundreds and thousands of protesters against economic inequality and joblessness ‘occupy’ public spaces, beginning a block from Wall Street in Manhattan, NY on September 17, 2011, and quickly spreading to dozens of US cities for a period of several months into late November. A New York real estate executive based in Manhattan back then, Trump recalled to the governors how the violent, coordinated nationwide police crackdown on a wholly and conscientiously peaceful protest moment had begun. Referring first to the current uprisings led by blacklivesmatter , he said almost wistfully: “This is like Occupy Wall Street. It was a disaster until one day somebody said, ‘That’s enough.’ And they just went in and wiped them out. And it’s the last time I heard the name Occupy Wall Street… They [had] closed Wall Street, the financial district of the world! And they had total domination… Nobody did anything. And then one day somebody said, ‘That’s enough. You get them out of here within two hours.’ And it was bedlam for an hour. Then after that, everything was beautiful.” What the president described as “beautiful,” had actually been intentionally brutal, with police and mayors in 18 cities sharing advice on how to destroy the Occupy Movement in their cities – advice that included using maximum force and brutality, night raids, militarized weapons like rubber bullets, bean-bag projectiles, tear gas and pepper spray, batons, sound cannons and flash-bang grenades. The goal was to terrify the occupiers and deter them from returning after being rousted from their encampments.  It had all been coordinated and orchestrated by President Obama’s Department of Homeland Security, which had declared the peaceful protest movement to be a “potential terrorist” threat. Indeed, following Trump’s surprisingly complimentary reference to the Obama administration’s bust-up of the Occupy Wall Street encampment (perhaps the only time in four years that this president has had a good thing to say about an action of his predecessor), AG Barr spoke. He told the assembled governors of his and the administration’s intention to use the anti-terrorism approach of the “Occupy model” to spy on and then crush the current wave of urban uprisings and protests over police brutality and militarization. As Barr put it,“The structure we’re going to use is the joint terrorist task force, which I know most of you are familiar with. Tried and true system. It’s worked for domestic and homegrown terrorists, and we’re going to employ that model.” By labeling a political action or movement terrorism, the government can use what are known as Fusion Centers, which are a very opaque merging, usually in one building, of intelligence people from local and state police, and from a variety of federal intelligence and police agencies ranging from the FBI and CIA to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Cyber Command, the DEA, the Federal Police, and others, to share information with each other about activists and protest leaders. The US Justice Department can then work to build cases against those who are surveilled, with the goal of filing terror conspiracy charges against them in the hope of locking people away for years or decades. It amounts to the action of a police state. According to the National Lawyers Guild, which has been providing legal services to protesters caught up in police attacks on their demonstrations, it’s clear that this is precisely what has been happening. NLG Executive Director Pooja Gehi tells RT:“What Barr means by the ‘Occupy Model’ is a coordinated federal/state/local program to target activists and local organizers in order to charge them with serious terrorism felonies.” She notes that the NLG’s attorneys around the country, in places like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, are all hearing reports that FBI agents are“accompanying police who are knocking on people’s doors.”Pooja warns that involvement of G-Men in any questioning of suspects is dangerous because of a federal law that makes it a serious felony simply to provide false information to an FBI agent. When the right to “peaceably assemble” outside the White House to “petition the government for a redress of grievances” like rampant police brutality is so threatened, that sacred First Amendment of the Constitution starts looking pretty tattered and faded, leaving some US citizens wondering at this point if it will survive until election day on Nov. 3.

"9 Jul, 2020",George Floyd’s harrowing final moments revealed in new transcripts as rookie cop asks court to dismiss manslaughter case,"Transcripts of body camera videos reveal that the officer who pressed his knee against George Floyd’s neck was dismissive of the man’s pleas for help. One cop charged in the incident has petitioned the court to dismiss his case. The footage, taken from body cameras worn by officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, reportedly shows Floyd pleading for his life in the minutes before he became unresponsive. “You’re going to kill me, man,”the Minneapolis resident said, according to a transcript of Lane’s body camera video. “Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk,”replied Derek Chauvin, the officer who sparked worldwide outrage after a video showed him pressing his keen on Floyd’s neck. The arrest and subsequent death of Floyd on May 25 sparked rioting in Minneapolis. Similar protests quickly spread across the United States and to cities all over the globe. The four officers involved in the infamous case of alleged police brutality were fired after footage of the incident surfaced. Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter, while his colleagues – Lane, Kueng, and Tou Thao – are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. The newly-released transcripts are part of a legal filing by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, who has requested that the Hennepin County District Court dismiss the case against his client. The motion argues that Lane did not intentionally aid Chauvin and that his vantage point of the incident made it impossible to accurately assess the situation. Lane, who was working his fourth full day as a full-time officer, reportedly asked Chauvin several times if Floyd should be turned on his side. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police, said it wasn’t necessary. According to Gray, Floyd acted erratically after initially being arrested and placed in a squad car, prompting the cops to restrain him for his own safety. The transcripts reveal that as the officers forced Floyd into the vehicle, the 46-year-old black man said:“I can’t breathe”and“I want to lay on the ground.” Floyd then allegedly began hitting his face on the glass window in the car, resulting in blood coming from his mouth. The Minneapolis resident was then removed from the squad car and placed on the ground. He was reportedly questioned about whether he had drugs in his system, after the officers observed foam around his mouth. An autopsy showed that Floyd’s heart stopped as Chauvin restrained him, and listed heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and recent methamphetamine use as“other significant conditions”which may have contributed to his death. The motion to dismiss argues that when put in proper context, the decision to pin Floyd to the ground was justified. Gray also insists that the new footage exonerates his client, but the court has not made the recordings publicly available. “I think the public should see it,”he said.“That shows the whole picture. If they watch the whole thing, people… couldn’t cherry-pick parts of it.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/494218-george-floyd-transcripts-court-dismiss/
"9 Jul, 2020",Princeton University faculty seek to establish racial thought police & punish insufficiently diverse disciplines,"Professors at prestigious Princeton University have assailed the school for its alleged “anti-Black racism,” issuing a lengthy list of demands including bribing departments to hire minorities (and punishing those that don’t). Over 350 Princeton faculty members have signed on to an open letter demanding the university prioritize the fight against “anti-Black racism,” which the writers insist “has a visible bearing upon Princeton’s campus makeup and its hiring practices.” Members of every department of the Ivy League school except Chemical and Biological Engineering and Operations Research and Financial Engineering have added their names to the July 4 manifesto, giving its 48 demands significant heft. For an “anti-racist” missive, however, some of the demands seem curiously…racist. Nonwhite faculty are to receive extra sabbaticals, extra pay and extra awards to compensate for the “invisible work” they do, the letter states, explaining how minority professors are called upon to “chiefly and constantly ‘serve’ and ‘represent’ [racial diversity] in the interest of administrative goals” even as its authors enumerate ever more diversity-focused administrative goals. Lamenting that just 7 percent of tenure-track faculty are non-white, the writers suggest giving those oppressed few “a full year of course relief” to seek out and recruit more faculty of color. More ominously, an “outside committee of academics, law professors, artists, and cultural advisors from communities of color” are to be brought in to make decisions about “race, racism, anti-racism, and racial equity” that will impact the entire campus, while an “internal committee of faculty and students of color” must be appointed to hold the university accountable for carrying out these outsiders’ demands. In addition to essentially bribing departments to hire minority professors, the school is ordered to financially punish those that don’t, “enforc[ing] repercussions” for those departments that “show no progress in appointing faculty of color.” Any hiring process that shows “no evidence of a concerted effort to assemble a diverse candidate pool” is to be squashed. The university is guided toward racial segregation in the name ofcounteringracism, whether by tasking minority faculty with hiring their racial peers or paying minority students to mentor underclass(wo)men of their own race. Administrators are to hold “semesterly open conversations” only with “students, faculty and staff of color” – no whites allowed, apparently. The Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity is ordered to work with individual departments to devise tailored plans for “anti-racist research, teaching, hiring, and retention,” ensuring no discipline can squirm out from under its responsibility to redress centuries-old grievances. The university website must include a line on its homepage acknowledging the campus’ occupation of “indigenous land,” and all faculty must undergo anti-bias training, the letter continues, adding that standardized testing should probably be abolished (it’s “strongly correlated with the underrepresentation of people of color on college campuses,” after all). Perhaps most disturbingly, the letter-writers want a faculty committee tasked with “investigation and discipline of racist behaviors, incidents, research, and publication on the part of faculty,” a sort of diversity Stasi empowered to enforce the rigid parody of tolerance that has become the new normal in academia. Suggesting the guidelines for what constitutes racist behavior and so on will be “authored by a faculty committee,” they appear to be nominating themselves for the role. Lest Princeton students feel like they’re left out of the action, the letter-writers suggest the school “acknowledge, credit, and incentivize anti-racist student activism,” starring with a “formal public University apology to the members of the Black Justice League” – the student protesters who have for years demanded Princeton remove the name of former US President (and former Princeton president) Woodrow Wilson from its School of Public Policy and International Affairs. The group staged a 2015 sit-in demanding the removal of Wilson’s name from all school buildings due to his racism, preceding the wave of “anti-racist” activism that has taken academia – and the US itself – by storm. Indeed, many of the BJL’s demands (including a dedicated black-only student space on campus) are echoed in the professors’ letter, and similar screeds have popped up at universities across the country, from the California State University faculty union to the University of Texas football team. Princeton voted last month to remove Wilson’s name from the school, a decision university president Chris Eisgruber justified by pointing to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But the letter-writers’ intentions extend far beyond the Ivy League institution’s walls. “Given Princeton’s influence,” they write, these “principled steps” are designed to “move the dial further toward justice for…the world.” ",https://www.rt.com/usa/494205-princeton-faculty-demands-racial-bribes/
"9 Jul, 2020","Lady Antebellum, renamed ‘Lady A’ in woke PR move, sues black artist who already has the name","Tennessee country rock band Lady A – known as Lady Antebellum before officially renaming itself amid 2020’s cultural purge of references to the Confederacy – is suing a black artist with the same name in a case of peak woke irony. The band’s lawyers have targeted blues singer Anita White, who also goes by “Lady A,” suing the artist over White’s “attempt to enforce purported trademarks rights in a mark that [the band] have held for more than a decade,” the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Nashville’s District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, reads. Lady Antebellum decided to change their name to Lady A because they’re woke now, only to find out a Black artist already existed under that name so now they’re suing to use the name anyways because they couldn’t come to a deal with her. Leftist virtue signaling in a nutshell. 🤦🏻‍♂️pic.twitter.com/pPHjkkdNxh The Nashville trio had reportedly been negotiating with the singer before their talks fell through, and White has now “demanded a $10 million payment,” a statement from the band alleges. Lady Antebellum officially changed its name on June 11 following weeks of anti-racism and police brutality protests triggered by the death of George Floyd, announcing it wanted to be “more inclusive.” Antebellum refers to the time period before the US Civil War, which resulted in the abolition of slavery in the US. However, Lady Antebellum claimed the band had used the “Lady A” name as early as 2006, citing a page on its website that referred to the nickname and referencing a 2010 filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office. With no opposition to their registering the trademark for “entertainment purposes, including live musical performances and streaming musical programming” – plus later expansions into musical recordings and clothing – the band insisted its ownership of the name was uncontested. “Prior to 2020, White did not challenge, in any way, [the band’s] open, obvious, and widespread nationwide and international use of the LADY A mark as a source indicator” for its music, performances, or merchandise, the suit alleged – as if the Seattle-based blues singer would have been following the legal filings of a band on the other side of the country. White, who has released several albums as Lady A, had harsh words for the country rock band she claimed was opportunistically piggybacking off “a moment in time” represented by the blacklivesmatter protests sweeping the nation. “If it mattered, it would have mattered to them before,” she told Rolling Stone, adding “It shouldn’t have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize their name had a slave reference to it.” Lady Antebellum, because of racist connotations, changed it s name to Lady A (which still stands for Antebellum) is suing Anita White, who has gone by Lady A for over 20 years. And I am showing Anita s face, not Lady Antebellum because F that noise.https://t.co/Q0x9OPVDCbpic.twitter.com/D4LcuV7YUq While the band’s lawyers acknowledged White had performed under the name “Lady A” since at least 2010, using the name to tour and sell her music over streaming services, they pointed out that she had not trademarked the name – or if she had attempted to do so, she’d applied after Lady Antebellum had already nabbed it. However, music attorneys who spoke to Rolling Stone pointed out that White had a “common law trademark” as she’d been first to use the name in commerce. The 61-year-old singer adopted the Lady A name singing karaoke in the 1980s – long before Lady Antebellum formed in 2006 – and has performed under the name throughout the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere under the moniker ever since. The dueling Ladies had apparently attempted to work out a legal agreement following Lady Antebellum’s name change after White called them out for allegedly stealing her name, a pact which included “continuing to share the name and supporting White’s musical career.” However, the blues singer told Newsday last month that she “no longer trust[ed]” the band, claiming “their camp is trying to erase me.” She told Rolling Stone that she had a business trademark for Lady A LLC, slamming the chart-topping country band for failing to even run a search before adopting her stage name as their own. “For them to not even reach out is pure privilege,” she said. Lady Antebellum changed its name to Lady A, “the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start,” last month amid a massive cultural backlash against references to the Confederacy that has included the pulling down of monuments and attempts to rename US military bases. Fellow country band the Dixie Chicks followed suit less than a week later, renaming itself “the Chicks” in a move that was widely mocked.

"8 Jul, 2020","San Francisco’s CAREN Act will ‘criminalize reporting minorities,’ conservatives say","San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton is outraged at white women calling the police on minorities. His creatively named CAREN Act would put an end to this, but conservatives claim it’s just more discrimination. Walton introduced the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies (CAREN) Act on Tuesday. Its name is a nod to ‘Karen’, which has become internet slang for a white woman who demeans store assistants, demands to speak to the manager, or, crucially here, feels unduly threatened by minorities. Racist 911 calls are unacceptable that s why I m introducing the CAREN Act at today’s SF Board of Supervisors meeting. This is the CAREN we need. Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies.#CARENact#sanfrancisco Walton was spurred into action by the case of Amy Cooper in New York. Cooper, who called the police on a black man in Central Park earlier this summer, has been criminally charged with making a false police report, despite her claims that she felt threatened by the man. Cooper is mentioned in a press release accompanying the bill, yet the statement also mentions the person who called the Minneapolis Police Department on George Floyd for allegedly buying cigarettes with a counterfeit bill. Knowingly passing off counterfeit currency is a federal crime, carrying a punishment of up to 20 years in prison. Given its mention of George Floyd, conservatives are wondering whether Walton’s bill would criminalize reporting minorities to the police, even if an actual crime was taking place. San Francisco is going to criminalize reporting minorities. That s just fantastic. The CAREN Act introduced at San Francisco Board of Supervisers to stop supposedly racially discriminatory 911 calls. They want to criminalize people calling the police. The agenda is obvious. The Left has subverted ""Karen,"" who is actually a progressive who watches ""Ellen"" This sounds pretty evil if you think of the likely outcomes of it. Making a false police report is already illegal, but in the wake of the ‘ blacklivesmatter ’ riots, lawmakers around the country are pushing to doubly punish offenders if the call is deemed to have been racially motivated. California Assemblyman Rob Bonta introduced abilllast month that would make“discriminatory 911 calls”a hate crime. Meanwhile, in New York, state lawmakers passed abilllast month that would give minorities the right to take legal action against anyone who they felt called the police on them due to their race, gender, or nationality.

"8 Jul, 2020","WATCH: SUV drives through crowd of BLM protesters in New York, but driver released without charge","A motorist panicked after being surrounded by blacklivesmatter protesters in New York’s  Times Square, speeding through the crowd and trapping a bicycle under the vehicle’s chassis. No charges have been filed as yet, however. “We have bikes that go in the front and block off the intersection and redirect traffic so we don t have to worry about things happening like what just happened,”one protest organizer explained after protesters pursued the driver for two blocks. The group of cyclists were attempting to stop traffic to allow the BLM protesters through when the driver suddenly panicked after their Dodge Durango was surrounded at roughly 9:10pm local time on Tuesday. Eyewitness footage from the scene shows the chaos that followed. Tonight, I marched w/ a wonderful group of people from WSQ.

Just sending out a announcement beforehand. 🤷🏾‍♂️ The 24-3 fighter’s outburst was made in apparent response not to the current political and racial tensions sweeping America and stemming from the killing of George Floyd in police custody, but from videos circulating on social media featuring the use of the word. The tweet was met with a mixed response from some of his followers, who accused him of being needlessly aggressive. One Twitter user told him to“f*cking grow up”,to which the fighter replied:“Or else what? You telling me to grow up because I’m making a statement? Or else what? You telling me to grow up because I’m making a statement? Like I said if a person was to call me that like so many videos I’ve been watching on the internet I will knock the shit out of a person.

One family member advised him to take heed of his grandmother’s advice about ‘sticks and stones’ and that names will never hurt you.

"8 Jul, 2020","You became RACIST yourself, users tell Reddit as it issues (& removes) ban on content portraying ‘people of color’ as ‘aggressors’","Reddit has announced that any type of content deemed offensive to people of color will not be allowed. But as outrage mounted among users over the policy, the post suddenly disappeared from the website. The policy update was posted by Reddit’s AutoModerator bot, which intervened in a conversation on the JusticeServed channel. “We can no longer allow any posts, comments, or other content that shows a POC [person of color] as the aggressor,”the publication warned. Corresponding videos, news and personal stories, photos, police reports, and“any other form of media”will be considered“hate speech and/or harassment.” The announcement itself then disappeared from Reddit. It is nowhere to be found on JusticeServed and other accounts, but stillavailableon the web archive. The policing announcement did not sit well with commenters who flooded the Reddit thread with angry replies, many bashing the platform for becoming what it says it is fighting against. “In your pursuit of anti-racism, you’ve managed to become racists yourselves,”one personsaid, while others called the policy“reverse racism.” Not surprisingly, some found the blacklisting announcement to be rather Orwellian.“Is this satire? It has got to be right? Literally big brother didn’t go to this extent,”a Reddit user wrote. “We can tell our kids we remember a time when they started shutting down the truth,”another said. Some enraged netizens called on everyone to stop using the“sinking ship”Reddit and migrate to alternative platforms. Reddit has been on a crusade against ‘hateful’ content in recent weeks, amid the waves of protests against racism sparked by the death of George Floyd. It wiped out multiple accounts, among them the subreddit ‘The_Donald’, believed to be the most popular community of Donald Trump supporters. The website’s executives accused the group of targeting and harassing individuals and repeatedly breaking its rules of conduct. Some, including YouTuber and managing editor of Human Events Ian Miles Cheong, said the company was using the mass ban to cover up a bias against the community of Trump supporters.

"7 Jul, 2020", Shameful : Tucker Carlson under fire for claiming senator who lost legs in Iraq ‘hates America’,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson is facing fierce backlash on social media after claiming that Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a war veteran who lost both her legs in Iraq, hates America. Speaking on his show on Monday night, Carlson noted that Duckworth was a top contender to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s pick for vice president. He took particular issue with her comment to CNN that it was time to have a“national dialogue”about historical statues in the country, including those to slave-owners like Founding Father George Washington. Here s what Tucker said about Tammy Duckworth tonight that prompted her fiery response:""Most people just ignore her. But when Duckworth does speak in public, you re reminded what a deeply silly and unimpressive person she is... These people actually hate America.""pic.twitter.com/yKZVNfwYFC Carlson began the segment by declaring sarcastically that people are“not supposed to criticize Tammy Duckworth”because of her military service, as if to brace his audience for the impending onslaught. He then proceeded to call her a“deeply silly and unimpressive person”who“most people just ignore.” Carlson said Duckworth was not seriously looking for a dialogue and claimed it was“no longer a question”that people like her“hate America.” “Can you really lead a country that you hate?”he asked, comparing the notion of Duckworth being vice president to a parent hating her own children. Unsurprisingly, the controversial monologue raised many eyebrows on social media. Netizens were so up in arms about Carlson’s“shameful”comment that his name trended on Twitter on Tuesday. One commenter suggested Carlson had""lost his dignity""while others called for the host to issue a public apology. The comments also prompted a reply from Duckworth herself. The double amputee senator fired back at the host on Twitter, asking him to“walk a mile in her legs”before telling her she does not love America. Does@TuckerCarlsonwant to walk a mile in my legs and then tell me whether or not I love America? Simply put:Serving our country, Sen. Tammy Duckworth lost her legs.Serving Fox News, Tucker Carlson lost his dignity. Ironically, Duckworth had already seemingly tried to backpedal on her comments about historical statues, perhaps unbeknownst to Carlson. “This has never been a debate about honoring the complex legacy of those who actually helped build our great nation,”shesaidon Twitter after previously receiving a backlash of her own. The issue of whether or not to remove controversial historical statues has been the subject of tense debate in recent weeks following the killing of George Floyd and renewed blacklivesmatter demonstrations. Some protesters have not been interested in debate, however, and have simply torn down the old statues themselves. If you like this story, share it with a friend!

"7 Jul, 2020","Not important what really happened, it’s more a question of who owns the narrative, filmmaker Werner Herzog tells RT","As facts matter less nowadays, “occupying the narrative has created… lopsided ideologies” and “lopsided information.” Famed filmmaker Werner Herzog shares his historical perspective with RT. The filmmaker discussed the understanding of history with host Afshin Rattansi on RT’s Going Underground. They started with the role of Soviet troops in WWII, as Herzog said their“incredible sacrifice”is being“ignored because of political interests.” It’s very much a question, not what are the facts… Today it’s not that important what really happened. It’s more a question of who owns the narrative. And occupying the narrative has created some sort of lopsided ideologies and lopsided information that we see every day. “I do believe that the demonization of Russia is a very, very big mistake,”Herzog said. Calls for the re-evaluation of historical events are particularly poignant today as massive protests for racial justice in the US and other Western nations are accompanied by the toppling and defacing of historical monuments. Though the director supports the ongoing protests as“completely necessary and overdue,”he is skeptical regarding the actions against the statues that comes with the upheaval. People are formed by past mistakes and should learn from them, he said. History doesn’t function by erasing the chronicles and toppling the monuments. The protests in the US were triggered by the death of unarmed black man George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May. Racial disparities have become“very evident”in the country, Herzog, who lives in Los Angeles, said, while“criminal justice is heavily biased.” However,“only a very, very small fraction of American police is rotten and acts in a way it shouldn’t.”The director believes that the growing calls to ‘defund the police’ are misguided. It needs to be reformed. That’s obvious. There is no doubt. Defunding it completely and replacing [the police] with boy scouts or vigilantes would be stupid. It doesn’t function like that.
